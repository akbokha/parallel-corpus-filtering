the package &amp; package ; contains various modules for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; despite their small size they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; by using this more easily available .
more information about the use of &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual of the cross @-@ section ;
to download these modules in the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; select settings extensions .... Open the box card tools and select the required modules .
this is a list of standard creation modules from the package KDE ; Ad@@ d@@ ons . please note that you may have more modules on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the package k@@ de@@ base , the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
to use the cr@@ ashing module , click on the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; on the extras you can view the page , the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; for the over@@ throw , or the list of stor@@ ing , if available , delete .
the module diagram filter ( also folder filter named ) can be reached in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar among extras you . with the module you can filter &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s latest working directory on different types of filter .
to use the DO@@ M -@@ Bau@@ man@@ vision in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; use the extr@@ as DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the document , example : docum@@ ent@@ element , all the other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view for objects with the MI@@ ME type for example . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbols and text views to view the content of your local file system .
the partic@@ ularity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists in it , dis@@ closing folder associated with the help of a so called Tree map graph@@ ically . each object is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the sub@@ ordin@@ ance objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; FS@@ View ; the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries is set in it . thus , it can be easily detected at the folder of folder . thus , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphic and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; -@@ commands you will be viewed .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; entry a rect@@ angle is a rect@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your file system . for sim@@ pl@@ est navigation you own the right @-@ definition of meaning@@ ful and print@@ able settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle that is swit@@ ched on view colour scheme , can either be a depth for the slight recogni@@ zing of f@@ usion or the illu@@ stration of another file characteristics such as name , owners , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rect@@ angle can be set with the various properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property you can see if sufficient place to represent or if the area of sub@@ ordin@@ ates will be used ( whereby the display faul@@ ts by restrictions on character of the reference point ) . moreover , you can specify the relative position of the reference to the rect@@ angle .
at Dar@@ creation algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps should normally be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . when the stairs in &amp; FS@@ View ; this goal is not always comp@@ lied to present the dis@@ ruption of entries , and this frame may not always be available . please note that less space is lost for the frame when the right square is square .
such as division of the area of an entry for the sub@@ ordin@@ ates , the implementation will be left . here it is necessary for the sh@@ ri@@ al and for the avo@@ idance of space , that rect@@ angles can arise . the best methods in relation to these are lines , columns or re@@ ur@@ sive branch .
you can specify the minimal given area for an entry on the menu entry view . instead , an R@@ aut@@ en@@ mu@@ ster is drawn into the area of an order@@ ly entry to view that this area is actually occupied by a sub@@ ordin@@ ance entry .
originally was &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ gets which was developed for the use of KC@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind .

from the th@@ umb@@ nail you can see the images that you want to compare , in the left or right area of the window , and then drop a zoo or shi@@ fting into one of the pictures , then these with the other image will also be executed . you can therefore compare the same area of the two pictures .
another mode is better suited to navigate quickly from a picture series , then the two first images are automatically displayed in the table . use the right neigh@@ bou@@ red image will be displayed in the left section . this will be simpli@@ fied it through a number of similar pictures .
of course , the normal wages also work directly out of the light@@ box as e.g. F@@ 4 file processing ....
all images from the right side bar of the main page are available for both the th@@ umb@@ nails . this makes it as simple vis@@ ually differences with lighting data to link .
at the bottom of each area you will find an built @-@ built @-@ in @-@ function , which you can see in the crossed arrows . to hold the visible area of the image , you must hold it and the &amp; L@@ MB ; pressed in the mode preview then both pictures show the same image .
the zo@@ om works as well as in other views . just use the zo@@ om Reg@@ ler among the pictures or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zo@@ om into the image and out to zo@@ om . this happens in both pictures if you are in the mode preview .
what is a digital transformation - away from the Mo@@ de@@ password ? digital transformation , each part of the process was followed up until the final output and the permanent storage . each of the photos records a form of digital transformation through . most of us do this but not in a systematic and efficient way .
we will give you a tool , a plan and practical tips as you can guarantee , protect and photos to use . we are looking at the procedure for dig@@ ital@@ ism . we consider downloading , group@@ ing , how , conf@@ lic@@ ting , archi@@ ving , waiting , and export of image files .
&amp; quot ; digital transformation takes on , indi@@ ces , categ@@ orized , categ@@ orized , stim@@ ulated , con@@ gest@@ ation , and exports the content that is a mon@@ ary or cultural value .
met@@ adata are defined as data on data . Met@@ adata are defined in accordance with your definition data , which will provide information on or an documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
I d@@ are to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t know how many photos you have , then use certainly not dig@@ i@@ ded ; . the approach guarantees met@@ adata in both a database and in the image files , is guaranteed very fast sear@@ ches and secure archi@@ ving for you to access with other programs , platforms and formats freely .
the first what you do and need to know before you have to do something in your system . you have to decide whether others have to access your photos , whether you want to store them on a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; watch it that you will eventually have to switch to a larger drive .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can quickly be found in one year times at the same place . if you have enough photos , then you will use sub @-@ folder as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; use . then a folder for pictures you print or publish on a web page .
professional photograph@@ ers have other requirements like sealing of the photos , archi@@ ving , work@@ flows , work@@ flows from pictures to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % Archive and 5 % of work files and you will then be able to organize your structure for this content .
which types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the st@@ acking processing easier . separate new of old files .
the separation of original and labour files are simpli@@ fied a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you search for an original or an ex@@ pi@@ ed picture .
we also recommend the option met@@ adata option in the addition of met@@ adata in &amp; dig@@ i@@ came ; it is certain that Ex@@ if@@ ying and IP@@ TC data into the file will be written , then you can re@@ affir@@ ming the met@@ adata from the database into the files by selecting the corresponding item in the menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change ? it represents &amp; dig@@ i@@ dered ; giving them a met@@ adata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
well , the real work begins , since you choose to select any photo keywords , indic@@ ative and a review . of course , you can select all images that need the same attri@@ bute and set the value then . you start the best with the rating or the lead@@ er@@ ect . this makes sense , since you can concentrate on the best photos .
let us now connect with keywords , key@@ word , as you are often called in other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
when deciding import images from another source with built @-@ in keywords , then will automatically insert the images to the right place . the s@@ orting of the Hier@@ archy within the tree is not a problem and can simply be done through the pull of a building to another . the changed keywords will be pursued by &amp; dig@@ i@@ v ; updated during the sub @-@ trees .
the graphic shows how different met@@ adata . this is a very large representation since each block of met@@ adata in truth consists of many sections . fil@@ ename and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough the keywords - the next section refers to conf@@ essions or comments , the third important tool to cat@@ alog@@ ing your met@@ adata .
you just want to see most nobody to see your photos just , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photograph@@ ers and agencies . they are sure to see how your photos arrive .
take a look at this panorama . from af@@ ar is not even a nice beach . if you look at it near@@ er , then start to see some details , people , the square .
and now I say to you that of the Lan@@ de@@ square of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; in the French Normandie 60 years after land@@ ing . Wow ! you start to dream , associations , the historical time period is again present , you may perhaps even hear the silence . the let@@ tering has completely changed your perception of this panorama .
for others who view your photos may be more important than the picture itself to create an interest . remember , the key is to transfer a story . remember to help Him about the moti@@ ve that you moves it to understand what you understand .
it is in order if an image is not perfect when it has the strength just to work with a certificate for itself alone .
with &amp; dig@@ i@@ came , you can also export a lot of text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , then you can even add it to a selection of images at the same time . KDE will give you even a rect@@ angle drive to your wishes in the certificate and / or the title of the Web @-@ gallery system . you have to tell the story so for the opening of the Web @-@ gallery for a second time .
remember the times before GPS ? as you had to find in another city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet at Goo@@ gl@@ e@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures , the train of the sp@@ ati@@ al presentation is now available with light speed .
the possibilities of Geol@@ ocation increases are already recommended and will be able to open in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can also export your trips with goo@@ gle Earth . you can also export the photos at G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flick@@ r &amp; etc ; by Goo@@ gl@@ e@@ Maps @-@ Viewer .
&amp; quot ; Copy@@ left is a wording of copyright and means to use the cop@@ y@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the works of others .
the following description tells you what information contained in the correct page of &amp; dig@@ i@@ came ; as information should be de@@ pos@@ ited :
author ( syn@@ onym for Sustain@@ er and authors ) : this field should be called the photographer , e.g. to protect the photographer of the photographer , for example , the name of a company or organization can be used . after which this value it should not be changed . this field does not support compress@@ or even sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ ons as divi@@ ders .
author@@ it@@ titles ( syn@@ onym for Ver@@ ges@@ tions ) : linked to the author . examples of this field contains the work design@@ ation of the photographer . examples for this subject can be title , fre@@ el@@ ementary photographer or in@@ commercial photographer . as this is a reference to the author , it must be filled out as well .
editor ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider of providers to identify who you have not necessarily be the author . if the photographer &apos;s work can be listed here , which you can offer the picture to others . if the image is a warehouse , then here the group / Agency will offer the picture here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , even though this has no protection against abuse . each of the solution for this problem is digital water@@ marks , delete or change . the solution for this issue is digital water@@ mark . for individuals , this protection is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and Half professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is per image unique . &amp; dig@@ i@@ came , will be available in the near future such a module for the for@@ kli@@ fts .

of course , we do not talk about CDs coming on the street or a brand . these kinds of Ver@@ lu@@ sten are the same that you can happen to traditional pap@@ er@@ photos or neg@@ atives . in this section it comes to problems with the so called new media .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the biggest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics , which has a data loss .
to fight the problem at CDs / DVDs , you have to be treated more and more expensive more than a couple of years . of course you can also get CDs and DVDs in Archi@@ v@@ ative . of course you can also get more expensive and much more expensive . there are offerings over Gold Co@@ ated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 the play the one life time of 100 years for himself . whether you believe it is in your mess@@ enger game .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be in@@ read@@ able , but you can use this risk in which you get good Dis@@ ks and good recording coun@@ ters are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write a lot of reliable . it turns it to the right now .
CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to errors , even if you have just been written . it is only effective data , the rest we needed for form@@ atting and the control system . despite this massive protection they through chemical aging , Ultra@@ purple light , scratch , dust &amp; etc .
for faul@@ ty CDs and DVDs there is a favorable program called the I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which does seem to work with CDs and DVDs . it also does not work for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications that cor@@ rupt data from cor@@ rupted flo@@ pp@@ ies , hard @-@ media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to win the For@@ mat@@ war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six@@ ty the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8,5 GB . everything which was said to CDs and DVDs are also applicable to the Blu @-@ ray disc .
burn slow with a good recording fee on high quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ etary format . also , you can copy the media with a description , date and author @-@ mark and before animals protected site . forget the latest piece of hardware or software that can read this media .
dis@@ vehicle retain your statistics for themselves . their manufacturing guaranteed include a new disc , but not the data . Google provides a large fiel@@ d@@ step on the error mechanisms of hard disks : dis@@ errors
in brief : Dis@@ ks hold most of the lon@@ gest when you are in the temper@@ ed range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . at lower temper@@ ed errors , SMA@@ RT can &apos;t determine these bugs . some of SMA@@ RT fixed bugs . these are in particular read@@ ings and rel@@ ational ometer . the expected life @-@ time period is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only about the complete process due to over voltage output . of course , you can also have data loss due to a power if you have saved the files , but these losses can normally be produced without great problems .
while most electrical devices power st@@ aves does not see much , that may take severe damage . on your computer you can cause serious loss , hard@@ design , destro@@ ying mother@@ boards , break@@ down mot@@ her@@ boards and other defic@@ it . describe yourself from the in@@ avo@@ idable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most widespread protection against electricity points is a super @-@ voltage protection . this is a device that some of the energy @-@ jok@@ es absor@@ bed and the rest det . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ bar . but remember that not every plug @-@ in @-@ bar is also included .
if you are looking for a over @-@ date protection , then you should pay attention to the UL product standard . this guarantees a specific minimum of protection . you should also be careful when it protects against flash and thus protects the properly connected devices .
since a more voltage of each cable can use to your computer , you should also be connected to all the peri@@ ph@@ ering tools that can also be connected to your system . some manufacturers will also provide one telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection possibilities for the co@@ ax@@ ial cable of the cable mo@@ dem@@ s and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , then you will need a portable voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially designed for not@@ eb@@ ooks and therefore also contain the protection for the modem . so you are ideal for travel .
while a Over@@ voltage protection your system protects your system from smaller variations in the electricity instructions , it will not really help you to loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a sub@@ breaking @-@ free power supply .
besides the protection from Over@@ voltage these devices can automatically provide cordless energy , when a electricity comes into account . some models allow them to continue working . if you buy a US@@ V and then you should be sure that they met the same quality requirements as a super @-@ voltage protection . in addition , the life @-@ time of the battery and the included software is interesting .
concerns the potential risk to susp@@ ended your computer system and compare its security in electricity disorders that you need up to &amp; euro ; 20 cost , A 500@@ W US@@ V can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is only a small price . to you think you should always remember all cables before you go to holidays .
the Amazon Web @-@ Service contains S3 Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use this as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amounts of data .
they are compared to the hard disks , but very expensive - 40 GB expenses &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB expenses &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you must send the data about the compar@@ atively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures . it is not about a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . for it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flick@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the Photo @-@ Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com make online storage services available on 1 GB and you will not have your pictures in full resolution online . the professional variant provides you more available , in case of Flick@@ r dramatic more . for 25 $ per year you will get unlimited memory , which should be checked in reality .
from the point of view of the data backup , the web @-@ solutions are very safe . transmission error thanks to the TCP protocol and with the big companies is included in the offer a backup and a shared memory .
the diagram illu@@ strate the elements of the transmission chain in calcul@@ ator . all transmission are sus@@ cep@@ tible to transmission errors . the fil@@ esystem z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs are at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
the worst comes to you that no one says when a transmission error has occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . it &apos;s pretty distur@@ bing that it should not give it to your computer . nobody seems to have thought to have . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much more secure drive than that of your computer .
un@@ reliable network parts are a further source of transmission of transmission , because they produce inter@@ mitt@@ ing within the data currents . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are currently not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micros@@ ystems seems to be b@@ other@@ ed by two candidates who can deal with turn@@ out on lower level and is available under one to the GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon also be available for Linux ; and Windows . read this article in English .
Oracle has started his own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ ance fil@@ esystem . this is still used in the Alpha status . it uses the same protective mechanisms by Z@@ FS and is also available for Linux ; but it is not part of the core .
do not under@@ estimate this both factors for 86 % of data transfer at not@@ ebook and 46 % in the work@@ book systems . in not@@ eb@@ ooks , the percentage of the theft .
data loss due to viruses is less common than the chis@@ el . it leads to a lesser damage , as such as theft . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; has long been no longer been s@@ ighted .
open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss than propri@@ etary systems : false , NTFS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and XF@@ S to call the spread file systems . a very good English article can be found here .
journ@@ ent @-@ file systems prevent cor@@ rupt data and data loss : false , only the speed of the investig@@ ating action during an operation is higher and an in@@ defin@@ ately status will be avoided before the problem appeared , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : false , theft and human mistakes are the main interests of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 blocks of fundamental physical limits . common is that while the technology is further developed there is a natural border for these progress . sensitivity and car@@ eers for all kinds of Li@@ als are no longer far away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s cameras will go down towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ ece and the end of high @-@ quality op@@ tics . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ xel . for higher resolution you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 750@@ GB hard disk get you today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not get any other for data transfer . 6 % of all PCs are often affected by a plan and test this backup before you make something like the re@@ installation of your operating system to make the exchange of plates or the size of hard disks .
supp@@ ose any daily your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash pro@@ poses that you are lucky when the drive has not been connected .
a disaster poses locally and destroyed a lot . forget air@@ plane : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough . they usually concern one whole room or the complete house .
therefore , des@@ ast@@ er@@ prevention is always a not local storage . bring your f@@ uses the stairs up to the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of the physical separation : as above mentioned is another reason for a data loss in spite of safeguarding the panic . if you have a backup the not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files will be backed up . it is a sn@@ apshot of moments without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differences : backup of the files have been changed since the last complete data . generates a complete moments of up to two time points : the complete protection and the last differences .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files have been changed since the last backup . you can restore the original status at any time . this backup comes with a sealing system at the next with the exception that it is only ab@@ st@@ ast@@ et and not continuously .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily create on your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file @-@ transfer@@ ring scripts , simply copies the difference of the files that really changed . this happens compres@@ sed , and if you want to increase security about ss@@ h .
secure important pictures directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or another optical medium .
this procedure lets you discover enough time to un@@ cover losses and restore . at the same time , you get a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly moments for at least one month and a moments for each month . any further expression should be manually after which you have made a complete review .
themes : met@@ adata , in the image file stored IP@@ TC Information , associated X@@ MP files , original , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ ent of pictures and met@@ adata , copy the pictures to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , visual equipment , ... , use of the internet .
to ensure valuable images the next 40 year , that is about the time period in which you are really interested in you , because they should remember your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be respected :
since the future because of your nature is un@@ predic@@ table you have to look at everything today . unfortunately , there is no other option than to have some vig@@ il@@ ance . unfortunately , all 5 @-@ 8 years , you should ask yourself as the current system back@@ ward is compatible . the less variants you have in the past , it is easier to assess the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered with the explanations in this document . use or change the open standards which are supported by many applications .
Virtu@@ alization is now available today . if you have an old system that is important to reading your images , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your machine architecture , your memory and security technology , you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard . stay in open standards .
scal@@ ability is the agent for the possibility to change a system in its size . this means always to enlarge .
let &apos;s take a time that you have planned the scal@@ ability with and in the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated record or partition . at * ni@@ x systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and over@@ lay the files on a new plate :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g whether your new record was recognised by the system , but hang it not .
&amp; Tag ; dd , = / dev / s@@ db / s@@ db / s@@ db / s@@ db ; part@@ ed res@@ sing / dev / sd@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the plate in MB@@ s ; # works with ext@@ 2.3 , fat@@ 16 , 32 and Reiser@@ FS ; resi@@ ze@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad c@@ 1 # change the size of Reiser@@ FS if necessary
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software to read it , then you can create it . this task will become easier from year to year easier .
GI@@ F is a propriet@@ or , pat@@ ented format that slowly disappear from the market . you should therefore no longer use it .
PNG was developed as an open source standard developed by GI@@ F . it can be fun @-@ free , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ adata , 16 @-@ bit per colors and full transparency . PNG can require relative many administrative information , but not as many as TI@@ FF and has a slow comp@@ ression . this format we want to recommend you to save your images .
TI@@ FF was widely used as a image format . TI@@ FF can be saved in un@@ compres@@ sed form or in a container with a ver@@ funny free comp@@ ression sal@@ ty . a problem is however that this format is adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The dig@@ al Neg@@ ative file format is a licensed free and open paper format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG has been developed on the TI@@ FF / EP format and is obliged to use met@@ adata for D@@ NG already and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon it again some@@ time .
this is possibly one of the reasons why to replace the Adobe its XML based X@@ MP technology ; a mixture of XML and R@@ DF ; it is a combination of XML and R@@ DF ; it is a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a combination of XML and R@@ DF . it is a combination of XML and h@@ DF ; the file information will be stored with enlargement &amp; quot ; .@@ x@@ mp@@ quot ; saved the for XML / R@@ DF .
many photograph@@ ers prefer to make it off a original size , mostly in the raw format , to archi@@ ving . X@@ MP is that there may be the met@@ adata separately from the image file . therefore , you should remember if you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything there together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata initiative is an open organization that supports up to fully compatible online met@@ adata in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a far @-@ depth acceptance of met@@ adata standards and practices .
import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . so long the pictures on the camera is , you can use this as temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save it in your Ro@@ har@@ chi@@ v . this function is not yet implemented .
for a fine course , you can use external programs . if you edit the pictures again with &amp; dig@@ i@@ came ; edit , then you should add the met@@ adata again . these have been cut under circumstances of the other programs .
use the be@@ processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export it only in Web@@ gal@@ erien , co@@ ding in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc .
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; dig@@ i@@ came ; in the section Ad@@ ding an photos to an album you will find a description of how you &apos;re already on your hard drive , however , you can already add many advanced settings to the import@@ ing of pictures to your Alb@@ end@@ home .
to use your Dig@@ ital@@ kam@@ era with &amp; dig@@ i@@ came ; connect them with the computer , turn the camera on the scor@@ emo@@ dus um and turn it to . another description can be found in the manual of your camera .
if you run the camera interface , try to connect with your camera . when some cameras can be displayed . some cameras will display a while . if this is the case , the fil@@ ename and a symbol for file order is displayed for each file , photos , movies , music etc . on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer you may need the camera information about each entry . with the side @-@ related characteristics and met@@ adata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its met@@ adata .
this dialog shows file properties and the Photo@@ information that are stored intern@@ ally from the camera . a symbol indicates that the image was not downloaded to your computer . please note that at some dig@@ ital@@ isation is not all information available .
the tab Met@@ adata displays the internal met@@ adata such as ex@@ if , manufacturer@@ not@@ ation , GPS etc . the image are the same as in the met@@ adata page row from the main window of &amp; dig@@ i@@ dered ; or the image processing . please note that these met@@ adata are not available for some dig@@ ital@@ isation .
the easi@@ est way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button . download all photos from their camera into a single album in &amp; dig@@ i@@ came ; . when downloading the photos were not deleted and we recommend you to check if the images can be downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all photos , you can only select the desired selection method of &amp; KDE . once you choose the photos , use the button below and then upgrade . the kno@@ b Selected is long as long as you have selected some photos .
if your camera does not support this is an option new download . these images have been downloaded yet again . in this case the new images are marked with a star in the advance window . if you choose this option , of course only the new images are downloaded .
if you use the buttons all the download or Selected works , a dialog with which you can select the target album , shown in which the photo album is displayed , such as normal folder you can read in the section M@@ eine albums . select the target album from the list and press OK .
after which you chose the target album , you press OK , and &amp; dig@@ i@@ came ; invites photos from the camera into the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once by selecting the kno@@ b Del@@ ete . if you just want to delete some , so you need to select it and delete it from deleted .
note , please note that there &apos;s no way there is photos that you have deleted from the camera to restore it . you should carefully review whether the photos are successful in an &amp; dig@@ i@@ ded ; album , you should delete them off by camera . if you want to delete the camera , you should do so much faster , because this is much faster .
cameras use as fil@@ ename for the photos often not particularly expres@@ sive names . the fil@@ ename are usually deleted once you can upload photos of different types of records into the same album . hence , it can be useful to integrate the date and time in which the picture was made , into the fil@@ ename .
in the next section you will find options to shoot and sp@@ elling of the image and for dat@@ al@@ ising sub @-@ based sub @-@ mode . if you use this latter option is automatically generated a folder per day .
the options D@@ uring the transfer opens three more options that are performed before the photos on the record . the first two concern the data on the disk in the section Standard Aut@@ ori@@ denti@@ ty . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the ex@@ if information in the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct the date &amp; time for all the downloaded pictures .
if you wish to use another file format as the default format , you can use e.g. in the mach@@ ining field the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . place this option to add date and time . for further adjustments you should read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time .
if you use the option camera file name , you have the option to change the fil@@ ename in petty letters . or in big letters , if you prefer this .
the new fil@@ ename , the &amp; dig@@ i@@ came , for a photo that will be displayed below the name that displays the camera in the preview . your settings to ren@@ aming will be saved and automatically used when you open the camera show@@ case .
&amp; dig@@ i@@ came ; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera to the schedule . not all cameras put this information . in the page row met@@ adata , you can read more details about the information that your camera is embedded in the photo .
the automatic fil@@ ming is normally swit@@ ched , and if your camera does not provide ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to switch off the automatic rotation . if you want to turn off the automatic rotation , and select the automatic rotation in the bottom of the window .
if your camera records information on the date , in which the photo has been made available , can &amp; dig@@ i@@ ding . not all cameras put this information in the target screen . not all cameras put this information available . in the section page row Met@@ a data you can read what information you have embedded in the pictures .
this option is normally off and in this case stores &amp; dig@@ i@@ came ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this option , you have to switch this option . use this option to activate this option and select the option file @-@ based sub @-@ based sub @-@ based coatings at the bottom of the window .
the easi@@ est way to upload photos from your computer to their camera is called button . select the file selection dialog &amp; KDE ; appears in which you can select the files that can be loaded and can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; KDE ; methods .
once the image selection is done , asks &amp; dig@@ i@@ came ; you where the images will be loaded high . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select the desired folder and click OK to upload the upload . the images are not deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general concept in this document . this is a position which is indicated in long@@ itude and l@@ atitude , which can be displayed on a map . identi@@ fying the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system .
not only for professional photo@@ graph can be interesting to link an image with a conc@@ ise geographical place . not everyone uses a plane to use an area by automatic recording of GPS @-@ data . environmental plann@@ ers , military , police , architecture office and real estate ma@@ kler can use this ability .
if you have forgotten when exactly the photo was made , you can send a postcard to another &amp; dig@@ i@@ p ; users want to send a postcard to another &amp; dig@@ i@@ p ; users want to locate the location of the photos , it is well to be documented that the position of a photo will be informed .
the question is how do the GPS data in the image ? first you should know that exi@@ on supports many GPS @-@ data fields , such as the direction , Saddle and card refer@@ ral . there are at least three ways to reach this . directly with the correct hardware , using the KI@@ PI module for the geographic assignment ( manual ) and last for the manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera , which has a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS receiver , either as a card module or by transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
downloading of GPS data from one device can be made with g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . you need to store this information in the file format , as this is the only format that is supported by the module for the geographical assignment .
there are several programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that extract the data from images and GPS . on the following page you can make the same under &amp; Linux : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and B@@ rei@@ ten@@ grade or other data then you can use this script , which works with the Ex@@ if@@ tool of Phi@@ l Har@@ vey . it uses the em@@ bl@@ es@@ po@@ ets coordinates , which can be created e.g. by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ google.com shows no European street cards . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; dig@@ i@@ came ; try to give you a lot of control over his work@@ flow as possible . there are many settings that can access the behavior of &amp; dig@@ i@@ came ; to select the settings dialog . you can switch between these settings . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left .

editor is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to offer the photo . this must not be the author as such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be entered into the picture of another &amp; quot ; . if the image is a warehouse , then the group or agency should be available here .
the IP@@ TC @-@ actions store the data in the appropriate IP@@ TC field . thus , the met@@ adata are permanently in the picture and not only in the database of &amp; dig@@ i@@ came ; . these met@@ adata are also available in other programs and can be import@@ ed in &amp; dig@@ i@@ ah ; import@@ ed without lost .

with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sam@@ pling is meant that the images are co@@ ded into a higher resolution of the fluor@@ ic density as well as in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia .
with the setting PNG comp@@ ress you can reduce the size of PNG files , since PNG requires a fun algorith@@ m . the only effect is that the image data can put more time for output and pack . if you have a quick computer , you can put this value on a high comp@@ ression . thereby means 1 : a low and 9 a high comp@@ ression .
with the option TI@@ FF files compres@@ sed , you can switch the de@@ late -@@ Kom@@ pres@@ sion@@ ist for TI@@ FF pictures . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF pictures . it does not reduce the size of the TI@@ FF images , since the de@@ late -@@ algorith@@ m ver@@ funny free .
with the setting of the fun@@ fun@@ eral JPEG @-@ 2000 files you can consu@@ me freely . even if you have written the loss of quality , the ratio of quality loss and data size is far better than the normal JPEG . when this paragraph has not yet been supported , but it was not yet supported in the planning .
in previous versions of &amp; dig@@ i@@ came ; the image processing only was a picture of picture for photos . currently , it develops very fast to a tool for mani@@ p@@ ulation of your photos . with this dialog , you can change the settings of the image processing .
the default l@@ ame is that all green pixels are equal to ul@@ tra@@ violet green pixels of the CCD @-@ sensor in the output . if you use this option , solve this issue with a minimal loss of details . this option draws the image a little soft , eliminated the 2x@@ 2 G@@ itter@@ ing with the V@@ NG@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
when this option is set , the whit@@ eboard is used in the camera . otherwise , if required , the automatic colour balance is used .
this setting is only used when the whit@@ eboard is not set . standard is it a fixed color balance , which has been photograph@@ ed on a white map which has been photograph@@ ed in the sun@@ light .
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SLR cameras . the benefit of the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps more details in the nick@@ name . for other cameras this option will be ignored .
the standard is it the nick@@ name , so the parts of your images are burned out , due to the dis@@ ability of your camera to observe , as they sear@@ ched the pl@@ umbing at diverse ros@@ at@@ ö@@ nen . finally , you can attempt some parts of missing information from the nick@@ name to record .
this is possible because blue pixels generally not so quickly to satisfy the green and red . &amp; d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ build the missing green and red po@@ ds from the still not saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a matter how much color or white you want .
if you select the option records , you will get the possibility to put a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and can therefore be individually adapted for each image .
put the L@@ umin@@ ous according to your taste . you probably have to put it slightly higher than the default 1 . this can also be made later in the image options of &amp; dig@@ i@@ ties ; image processing , should hold the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , should you be conserv@@ ative .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing -@@ algorith@@ m is a digital image file , to count a full picture of the sub @-@ fil@@ ter@@ ated image sensor , which provides many cameras and which is a matrix colored pixels . this algorith@@ m is also known as C@@ FA @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour re@@ design .
&amp; dig@@ i@@ came ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you three alternatives to : Bil@@ in@@ ear , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ ic y @-@ Direct@@ ed ) was the first algorith@@ m of the D@@ cra@@ w . it generates but d@@ art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges . Bil@@ in@@ ear is interesting when you search a quick solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the color devi@@ ation of your l@@ enti@@ ls you can get the red and blue cor@@ rec@@ tive values here . this is certainly the best method for a color view , since it is carried out during operation .
a profile translated the color information and there are instructions like this again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; dig@@ i@@ came ; information as well as the color information from a color room in the others are the colors as accurate as possible .
behaviour questions , when a picture is open in the image processing , / colour management module will start with raw files .
color folder Show you can write here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .c@@ ol@@ or / ICC , in which you save all your profiles . &amp; dig@@ i@@ came ; studied this folder then during the Star@@ ts .
setting of the ICC &apos;s Profile you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to be de@@ pos@@ ited . everything can change later on the opening of the raw file later .
the colour scheme is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Arg@@ y@@ ll . here are only your pictures rather than the whole screen .
the entry profiles should be appropriate to the camera connections and model that you use . not all profiles are created on the same type . currently , d@@ cra@@ w Gamma is not available for conver@@ sions with 16 bit depth . this means that you must perform the color tone m@@ apping itself .
there are more options such as the soft Proof profile , with which you can em@@ ulate as your image is returned from a device . this is very useful before you can print a smaller color area as your printer and some colors can therefore be very saturated instead of having to rely on the blind algorith@@ m of your printer .
for most cameras it is quite obvious which are intended for them for what is provided . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore , here a table of cameras and prof@@ iling that fit together . this answer is of course in@@ officially :
the Canon Profiles allows the style to realize : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
KI@@ PI is the &amp; KDE ; image Plugin Interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; KDE ; image br@@ ighter and imag@@ inations ; many modules have been written ; many modules have been written to work with each program that support the KI@@ PI interface .
if your distribution has installed the KI@@ PI modules , see a list of available modules . select which you want to use and these will then be downloaded by &amp; dig@@ i@@ p . these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main menu , and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the lecture .
short commands for tasks that are carried out by modules can set in the menu under settings short commands .

different sh@@ ash@@ ore can be used in &amp; dig@@ i@@ ón ; used to adjust the main window to your taste . these settings can choose settings from the tool@@ bar . one preview of the available designs will be shown below :
these designs are specified in simple text files . if you are interested in such a new design for &amp; dig@@ i@@ came ; find out more about this tutorial in this tutorial .
&amp; dig@@ i@@ came ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use these to watch your photos and to correction and improve . image processing can be started by clicking on the preview of an image or through the context menu on the preview and selection of the entry .
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; dig@@ i@@ came ; so you may not be part of your distribution . further information about the KI@@ PI @-@ modules can be found in the section image processing .
a status line at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ ename , current data @-@ number , mag@@ nific@@ ation factor and the current image size shows .
a menu bar on the top of the top and below the tool@@ bar for fast access to the most common functions .
the mach@@ ining functions of the image processing your photos . no of the functions will change the original photo before you save file memory or the kno@@ b store from the tool@@ bar . please note that you can &apos;t restore the original photo as soon as you have saved the original photo .
so you should possibly have a copy of your image before you change it . this allows you to save it with file memory .
as long as you have not saved the photo you can restore the original value , using the menu file re@@ produce or the kno@@ b , connect the button processing in the tool@@ bar . you lose every change that you have performed in the photo since the last memory .
nearly every action of the image processing can be re@@ vers@@ ed or restored . the last action you can re@@ vers@@ ed by edit re@@ vers@@ y and re@@ produce re@@ produce re@@ produce from the menu .
if you often use this , you should remember the keyboard , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to res@@ ellers and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ um@@ ph@@ ins to re @-@ produce .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; about the call@@ back or re @-@ pull button in the tool@@ bar , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu @-@ menu , all actions in between also reco@@ vered or restored .
once you have started the image processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same name , using the navigation links in the tool@@ bar . if you have made changes in the menu file , you will be asked if you want to save it .
you can in the photo and out out zo@@ om in which you can use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the reference menu .
to adjust a photo to the window Size , you can use this kno@@ b in the tool@@ bar : enlarge it automatically
view full screen mode , the photo in the full screen mode . you come into the normal view , in which you do not want to use the dining table . if you do not want to change this in the imagination dialog by &amp; dig@@ i@@ came ; stop this window , you can see the section for inter@@ iors of the image processing .
if you want to print the current picture , you can select the image file and get the default &amp; KDE ; printing dialog . you can customize here the settings before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print individual images or whole pro@@ positions . whole image can be printed out of your selection . you just need to select the pictures with the standard methods and choose from the menu album Ex@@ porting printing assistance . if you follow the wi@@ z@@ ard you need only to make your choice .
the &amp; dig@@ i@@ came ; main window has a page row on the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same page row is available , even in the image processing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked :
multi@@ f@@ aches Click on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear or return to the edge .
in the print@@ able view you can enter acc@@ us@@ ations with unlimited size or insert . please note the re@@ mark below . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special features are allowed to be copied in the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields so that you can use of other programs .
the IP@@ TC @-@ data supports only ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are recorded according to 2000 characters and use special equipment . if you want to use the IP@@ TC print@@ able field in other applications , you should consider these restrictions .
after you comm@@ ented it you use either the kno@@ b , or just switch to the next picture , the indic@@ t@@ ations are then saved .
besides the object @-@ button there is a kno@@ b more . with this you can read more met@@ adata from the selected file or database . however , but you can also select the met@@ adata in the files . however , if you have chosen a met@@ adata that is always written in the pictures .
the section assessment shows a rating sch@@ ema of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in Su@@ ches and s@@ orting . it can be used either with a single click on the 5 stars on the page row or by the side@@ bar . the review from the side@@ bar will always be used on an image . to select multiple images at the same time , choose them from and use the context menu .
the assessment will be written in the IP@@ TC field . the co@@ ding follows the sch@@ ema in the following table :
the stit@@ ching view shows a sear@@ ch@@ box on the fil@@ tering of the keywords , the sam@@ pling and a selection box with the previously used in this &amp; dig@@ i@@ ties ; session uses frames .
the stit@@ ch is dynam@@ ically adapted to the given search . you can restrict the number of ways in finding a key@@ word quickly . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom is another relief when entering your keywords at a picture series . if you have different keywords , they are saved for quick access .
keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding attachment areas in the tree . all keywords of an image will be saved into the IP@@ TC field .
if multiple images are selected at the main view and you choose a key@@ word in the sam@@ pling tree , this is only applied to the highlighted picture and not on the entire selection , if you want a choice with a key@@ word , please refer to the section called Fir@@ st@@ filter .
the side bar sam@@ pling filter is used to change the selection of the main window frames . usually , the left page row with its album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , sam@@ pling and search views . if additionally a or several sam@@ pling filter , will be displayed , only the cut of these two displayed . all displayed keywords are available .
you can also take key@@ words and draw . supp@@ ose you have selected in the main view over several pictures to you with stit@@ cher , you can simply drag it out of the right page row , and appears to select a dialog , which you ask if you want to put the key@@ word .
in the upper example the main window shows the pictures on a cal@@ ender day . the sam@@ pling filter is reduced to the keywords , which have been selected with Str@@ g + a , and after that , a key@@ word is drawn from the right sam@@ pl@@ tree to choose from there . a dialog asks if this sam@@ e@@ word is to be put .
this search for changes will take place at any start of the program . you can also be swit@@ ched under settings Miscellaneous .
if you have a rule with and created and determine that it would have to be one or would have to be , you can easily change it with a double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry to the database is looking for . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or a string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can choose a Extension search of all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to use options , you only need to use the cross @-@ field at the end of the rule and afterwards the button group@@ ing . the options can be seen as follows :

this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly worked at &amp; dig@@ i@@ came ; s concrete implementation adapted .
the reason why one sets an colorful break@@ flow from which actually photograph@@ ed or sc@@ anned devi@@ ate from the actually photograph@@ ed or sc@@ anned colors . with a col@@ oured work@@ flow , you can reach that the colors on your monitor , from your camera or scanner the same and the colours which you print or publish the colors that they will publish from your digital dark @-@ room .
if the theme is coming to colour management , then everybody wants to know which buttons it needs to provide you for the results that he wants . un@@ fortunately it means you are sufficient background information about colour management . in addition , links with deeper information enable you to make your own informed decisions so that you will receive the desired result .
if your work@@ flow is all six listed below , then you must don &apos;t worry about color administration .
you are working on a monitor one on the s@@ R@@ GB color room . ( more information can be found below )
your single other image gifts are by e @-@ mail or the Web , where s@@ R@@ GB of de @-@ fac@@ to standard is .
so if s@@ R@@ GB is so good working and the life for everyone is so easy , why you should use another far@@ ewell room and make your thoughts about col@@ our@@ alt@@ n@@ g ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ R@@ GB compared to the colors which we really can see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colours which we can see , the hu@@ f@@ usi@@ form region , and the colours in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some bigger color trees , so visit Bru@@ ce Lind@@ blo@@ oms exc@@ ell@@ ente page and click on information and then on information About R@@ GB Working spaces .
do I have to install my monitor if I decided to work for it only in the s@@ R@@ GB color room ?
yes ! whether you work in the s@@ R@@ GB color room or not , you need to make your monitor k@@ alli@@ ed , since s@@ R@@ GB of it goes without the circle . if you work as in the color room of s@@ R@@ GB , then you must either use your monitor to the s@@ R@@ GB standard , a reasonable monitor profile or both .

this tool makes five automatic cor@@ rec@@ tions available to improve a picture in most cases . use it therefore before you try to try a further manual .
the functions norm@@ alize , ab@@ same , automatic and contrast , extend from the menu correct automatic correction automatically try out of your colors the best . you will be experim@@ ent with these effects , to see which best in your photo .
Nor@@ m@@ alization : this method scal@@ y over the whole picture , so that the dark@@ est point black and the br@@ ight@@ est point is as bright as possible without its color grad@@ ations . this function is often a magic correction for pictures the dark or was@@ hed .
in the same : this method j@@ us@@ ts the light@@ box of the colors of the selected image , so allow the same very good results in enhancing the cont@@ ra@@ sting of an image , sometimes it does not only produce tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful surgery that works either mir@@ acles of a picture or it destroyed .
automatic : this method maxim@@ ises the color area in the red , green - and Bl@@ au@@ kan@@ al . you select the dark and bright har@@ row , and j@@ us@@ ts the red , green - and ch@@ au@@ can@@ als to the complete histori@@ o@@ grams .
contrast to extend : this method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ ance of the R@@ GB values of one image by the move the lowest and highest values in the greatest possible area and a re@@ en@@ usti@@ ble of all values in between . this is only visible in selected images and can be a good correction for poor photos .
the whit@@ e@@ zes of &amp; dig@@ i@@ came ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the whit@@ eboard of a photo .
the whit@@ est correction is somewhat limited to over a color room with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you can do so far from the original value you can perform areas with over@@ exposure to which in 16 @-@ bit mode , which in 16 @-@ bit mode , you will drop your ways to correction better .
this tool is based on a whit@@ ew@@ alk sal@@ a . the copyright of Pa@@ wel T. Jo@@ ch@@ ym is protected . you start it via the menu entry into the whit@@ e@@ tion of the image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side are both the original value as well as the preview of the target image . if you want to see dynam@@ ically the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original gr@@ inder of the original product , then it &apos;s enough to click the original window .
the preview of the target group has a red marker . the L@@ umin@@ ance of the Pix@@ els under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ o@@ graph .
to the right top becomes a histor@@ ogra@@ m shown that dynam@@ ically changed once you have a parameters . this hist@@ o@@ graph is very helpful there , even in well illumin@@ ated pictures , most pixels very small L@@ umin@@ ated values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is indicated . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ati .
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and gam@@ ma . the shadow adju@@ sting you can improve your photos or down your photos .
An@@ stat with the above controls around , you should use the color temperature of Pi@@ p@@ ette . click on this button and then somewhere on the image to use the color temperature of the white temperature of the whit@@ eboard . on these types also the temperature and green @-@ values are automatically set .
additionally , you can set the whit@@ eboard with the list of preferences . the following settings are available :
the under@@ exposed indic@@ ator increases the colors when more than a color channel of the Pix@@ els are over@@ estimated .. you will see the combined result in the whit@@ eboard . this will appear in the preview as pure indic@@ ator and has no effect on the final picture .
the buttons Save as and loading exactly this . each setting of the whit@@ eboard you can have to save it into a text file and then load them back later .
the kno@@ b pres@@ ets set up all the filter values back on their standard values and the corresponding neutral wre@@ ath . please note that such a different settings may result in another photo than your original . if you save it , your original value is changed .
you can adjust the co@@ di@@ ments of the be@@ processed image . 8 @-@ bit co@@ ding is the far common JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit co@@ ding is better for high @-@ quality pictures . this co@@ ding is needed even more turn@@ tables , arith@@ me@@ tic time and stands on@@ ly@@ for the formats PNG , PN@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialogue as to the processing of raw material . it uses the change and assignment of color prof@@ il@@ en . colour tone m@@ apping can be carried out by the sub@@ window for the brightness of colors . a detailed guide for the use of color profiles can be used to rate the chapter gra@@ dient function .
another important tool is available in the menu under colors sound @-@ correct structure . this tool provides an integrated way to use multiple color channels at the same time . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always make the same error and you can always find the same correction . in the manual for the sound @-@ correct , you will find more information .
a very powerful way to correct issues is the tool for Grad@@ uation that you can find in colours grad@@ ation in the menu .
the &amp; dig@@ i@@ came ; tool Far@@ be@@ ff@@ ects will give you four color effects , a vel@@ ocity filter , a ne@@ on @-@ effect and a cant@@ on filter at your disposal .
in times of chemical processing was solar eri@@ li@@ zation , also Sab@@ ati@@ er called , a effect of the image arose , and after the development of the image . this had the effect that the lighten@@ ing areas are dar@@ ker and the colors carried out by the second lighting inver@@ ted . the result was a divi@@ ding negative of the image . this tool allows you to fin@@ alize this interesting effect fin@@ ely .
the intensity controls the solar eri@@ li@@ zation . at about 50 % intensity shows the image that is chem@@ ically possible . another increase creates finally a neg@@ ativity that so does not create on phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of solar panels . the origin@@ ation is the ( 1 ) and the process which has been edited ( 2 ) . the Applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter si@@ mis@@ led the so called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; -@@ Eff@@ ect . it is different from an satur@@ ation , that he makes a stronger contrast , which makes the colours brilli@@ ant and gl@@ az@@ ing . try it simple , he emb@@ ell@@ ished many photos .
Vel@@ via is the market name for one to day@@ light optimized for one on day@@ light . Vel@@ via offers very saturated color for day@@ light and high contr@@ asts . Vel@@ vi@@ as has very saturated color for day@@ light and high contr@@ asts . Vel@@ vi@@ as strong which colors are also some photographs but also some photographs are very natural , too much .
the neo @-@ density filter sim@@ ulated the brightness of the result . the parameter level controls the brightness of the outcome and the sli@@ ders of re@@ peti@@ tions . at large images the filter the entire CPU for a moment can lau@@ g@@ hed .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not un@@ common that you want to correct the color gra@@ ving of your photos with tools in the menu under colors . once you are viewing with the results you are using the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you get a photo of bad light conditions , you can get the re@@ vers@@ ed problem : one to great satur@@ ation . even in this case , the tool for brightness of satur@@ ation , instead of it . all changes you can perform in the preview . if they like the result , you can confirm the result with O@@ k .
between the complex tool Grad@@ uation and the simple lumin@@ ous / contrast / Gamma is the tool sound value to improve the exposure . even if the dialogue on this tool is very complicated , you need for the area of sli@@ ders . concrete the three sli@@ ders below the Hist@@ o@@ gram@@ ms .
the window includes a graph@@ s of intensity , an hist@@ o@@ graph , of active channel , or of the selected area . under the Grap@@ hic one can change three sli@@ ders of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easi@@ est way to learn to learn to move the regul@@ ator and to watch it on how the image changes .
on the right hand side can be considered the original and the preview of the picture . the preview is dynam@@ ically , updated by the settings of the picture , updated . on the left side the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this op@@ tionally box can be set if the Hist@@ o@@ grams are presented with an lin@@ ear@@ en or log@@ arith@@ mic Y @-@ axis . for pictures of a Dig@@ ital@@ kam@@ era is often domin@@ ating the linear hist@@ o@@ grams of a single column . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic contrac@@ ting of useful .
three shelves : the top for the Dark T@@ ones , the mean for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , frequently Gam@@ ma@@ values called .
the three color pin@@ p@@ ettes can be used in the preview of the original band , in order to automatically convert the input values , middle and bright tones . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow for the selection of manual values for each field . there are also two shelves that can be used for output values as with the input values , for example , to create an extended image as background to create something different in the for@@ eg@@ round .
automatically : with this kno@@ b the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity of the image .
save as and store : with these buttons , the selected values can be saved in the file system and later use the Gim@@ p levels format used .
if you use this mode and the three color p@@ ts , the input values are re@@ orted automatically for all shadows , resources and Sundays . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette to use the input values of the Hist@@ o@@ gram@@ ms for Rot@@ - , green - , Blue and the L@@ umin@@ ales .
the option to check @-@ off @-@ indic@@ ator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and to show you the combined result of all channels . this is a indic@@ ator , that means you will get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect at the final result .
below you can see an example for the alignment of the input values to the red , green and blue channel of an photos . intensity and Alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original value is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
on the left hand , half of the original and the target screen appears . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated depending on your settings . on the right hand , the following options are available :
modification channel : this selection box allows the channel to enter the module that is changed by the module :
besides this box are two symbols in order to switch between a linear and log@@ arith@@ m@@ ical view . for pictures with a Dig@@ ital@@ kam@@ era , the linear mode generated a wide beam . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic mode continues .
if you move for example a short panel to the right , for example the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones with dar@@ ker cor@@ ns and that of the associated image are dar@@ ker .
on the preview of the original f@@ otos is a red marker . if you want to change this mark on the area you want to change the original value on the curve . create a point on this line and move it up and down , until the value after your taste is j@@ us@@ hed .
save as and store : with these buttons you can make exactly this . each b@@ end you can generate this file system and loaded later . the file format is loaded the Gim@@ p curve format .
if you use this method and the three color p@@ ts -@@ buttons automatically create the control points of the curve to all the channels of the Sch@@ atten@@ tions , Central and Sonn@@ ent@@ ures . enable the color p@@ enter to put the control points for the red , green - , Blue and L@@ umin@@ anz@@ kur@@ ve .
the option overweight indic@@ ator , in order to display all color channels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you will get the combined result . here it is a indic@@ ator , that is , you will get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect at the final result .
below you can see a Black @-@ white picture , which was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ kan@@ al . Sch@@ atten@@ de@@ - and Sundays was applied with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and on the cur@@ ves . the origin@@ ation is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel @-@ mix@@ er of &amp; dig@@ i@@ came ; image processing is a tool to improve the color can@@ als or to change the color grad@@ ations of the photos .
the channel @-@ Mix@@ er is another highly developed tool to mix the color tones of images . you can edit it from the menu color channel mix@@ er of image processing .
with the canal selection , you can choose the color for the hist@@ o@@ grams : this gives you a first notice how you can correct the channels by selecting the relative distribution and r@@ ash . the original area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be seen compared to their own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position these in the image appears a vertical line in the hist@@ o@@ graph to show you the corresponding color value .
controls for the module are on the right below : Reg@@ ler for Red , Green and Construction allow you to mix these channels . if you also keep the appropriate color components , as the channel @-@ mix@@ er then DAS tools for the production of great black @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos is . try to reduce the Grün@@ kan@@ al for Black @-@ White portra@@ its .
sometimes , especially if you mix mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible smoke which does not occur in the same place in the color can@@ als and their smo@@ ker mates in each channel looks different . if that is the case you can improve your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me conversion through which you need the Far@@ mer first .
the Save as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any mix@@ er setup , you can save it for later and then load the file format is the Gim@@ p @-@ mix@@ er format .
the option to check @-@ off @-@ indic@@ ator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and to show you the combined result of all channels . this is a indic@@ ator , that means you will get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect at the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel is re@@ mun@@ er@@ ated in which the blue channel is enabled . the original value is displayed under ( 1 ) and the original picture below ( 2 ) .
black / white @-@ photography has always been fascinating because of your abstr@@ action . with the development of digital photography is black / White a work step , as colour pictures can be converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll@@ de@@ profiles .

green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white Fil@@ mb@@ ing with a green L@@ ins@@ ec@@ filter . this looks good for all scen@@ eries and fits particularly well to portra@@ its against the sky . therefore similar to 0@@ 04 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Found@@ ing .
Oran@@ ge@@ y : sim@@ ulates a black / white fil@@ tering with a orange filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . so similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Oran@@ ge@@ y .
Rot@@ filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white filtration effects associated with a red L@@ ins@@ en@@ filter . this creates dramatic heavenly effects and can sim@@ ulate mo@@ ur@@ chts@@ an@@ enen to day@@ time sim@@ ulate . so similar to 0@@ 03 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Rot@@ filter .
Gel@@ b@@ filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white Fil@@ mb@@ ing with a yellow L@@ ins@@ filter filter . this is the most natural color tone structure and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thereby similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Gel@@ b@@ filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : creates warm lumin@@ ous and medium tones for it a bit col@@ d@@ ness in the Sch@@ att@@ ent@@ ö@@ nen . this is very similar to the process of a print and re@@ development in a sep@@ i@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and therefore similar to 0@@ 05 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; dig@@ i@@ came ; tool tex@@ ture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
by adding an tex@@ ture to your image , ir@@ respective of it is a color picture or not , you can look like a oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop way of enlarged points or like a wall image on a wall . the menu entry into the image processing can be used for this .
relief : move this parameter to the right to the end of the depth or three @-@ dimensional tex@@ ture on the image .
a paper tex@@ ture is used on the photo below . the origin@@ ation is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; dig@@ i@@ came ; tool frame can add a decorative frame around an image .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of an photos is not an easy task . a possibility to keep his attention . this is an psychological barrier to the stre@@ aming eye . under picture frame , the module can be started from the image processing .
type : with this parameter you place the desired Rah@@ ment@@ yp for your image . per@@ tin@@ ent the image with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce , w@@ asted it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame that is ideal for a button @-@ dimensional , and ornam@@ ental adds a decorative frame with patterns .
width : returns the width of the frame in percent . the standard area for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
this with the frame must be larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing of images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio .
with this practical tool , you can insert easy a form@@ att@@ ed text in an image of popular place . this also goes on several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text image size , the greater the image , the bigger must be the character size . to the conclusion , simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
each setting you chose for your text can be changed until you press to the button &quot; OK . after the image is stored once , the text part of the image . he can no longer be changed .
with the &amp; dig@@ i@@ came ; tool to apply a template to a picture .
the menu image template used in the image processing can be used to put it on an image .
for the template there are no restrictions on the size and orientation . you do not need to add the PNG file format and should be able to add with maximum compres@@ sing the file size ; just send an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; dig@@ i@@ came ; mail@@ ing@@ liste dig@@ i@@ came @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool at first time , you need to put your favorite on@@ folder with the kno@@ b base folder in the dialog . select the folder you will be copied to the log files . these settings will be painted for the next start .
after the root folder for the st@@ encils , a civil structure appears to be reflected in the folder structure of the Schabl@@ as super@@ structure . selecting a folder update the th@@ read@@ ed of the Stencils automatically .
under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the mag@@ nific@@ ation factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this kno@@ b have enlarged the shown picture . it is centered to the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
smaller : this kno@@ b drop down the below picture . it is centered to apply the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole image , you need to classi@@ fy the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move it under the template to move the picture . take the picture and place it on the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your picture . the image is then automatically adapted to the th@@ umb@@ nail .
&amp; dig@@ i@@ came ; represents three different tools to shar@@ p@@ ens . each of you has advantages in other areas .
shar@@ p@@ ens is a traditional tool to shar@@ p@@ ens . it is very fast and easy , but created especially in dark areas , gr@@ asp@@ ed pictures .
inf@@ ant m@@ ask is working on the contrast of the edges to make an image shar@@ p@@ ly . you can use it a really good job . you can use it a really good job . the algorith@@ m was taken from Gim@@ p and it is copyrighted by W@@ inst@@ on Chang .
foc@@ uss@@ i may possibly be the best of the three because he really improves the shar@@ ks . he is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters to adjust .
photos without focus and most dig@@ i@@ tised images need a correction of the shar@@ ehol@@ ding colors with only minimal difference to a color point . the same phenomenon can be printed out to a color point . SLR cameras will usually need more in@@ depen@@ dency as normal cameras for private users .
at JPEG image is often a camera internal shar@@ pen@@ ing . images in the raw format is always must always be done during the processing .
some scanner turn a shar@@ pen@@ ter of the image . if you dis@@ able it , you get control of your picture .
in some situations you can get needed results by raising a photo with the shar@@ pen@@ ters . this allows you to correct it with the menu entry .
you should hereby deal with caution because the results does not work very natural : the shar@@ pen@@ ing of the edges , but also intensi@@ fying the noise . in general the need for the shar@@ pen@@ ing of a picture the tool can re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ed on the menu pro@@ motional re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ed . among re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ing you can find more information and a comparison of all techniques for shar@@ p@@ ens .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is a cris@@ p . the solution to record the picture is much easier than it shar@@ p@@ ens . use the tool to soft@@ ening soft@@ ening soft@@ ening and experim@@ ent something with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ cot is a very good tool to remove loop from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the origin@@ ation and the preview will help you edit the image . the preview show@@ case shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and amount . the standard values can produce good results and should be tried out first . a increase in radius , or the amount flow , the effect . if you make the inf@@ ant m@@ ask , become smo@@ ked , and the impression of Gr@@ ates in the vicinity of sharp edges .
the radius presents a number of pixels on each side of a channel by the filters . high @-@ resolution pictures allow greater radi@@ i . they should therefore look at the best in their final resolution .
the amount poses the percentage between the original and the re@@ ign@@ ant picture one of the original is added . thus , the strength of the shar@@ ks set .
the tail value is a fr@@ action of the maximum R@@ GB value and the difference difference . you can thus define a minimal difference for a needle . in this way they are lab@@ elled with a soft change between the pot@@ tery from shar@@ ks and therefore beauty faul@@ ts in fac@@ ets , cel@@ esti@@ cks and water surfaces .
this is an example of the bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king filter . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the working picture the ( 2 ) . bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ cot was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and one thres@@ hold = 0.0 .
the &amp; dig@@ i@@ came ; tool focused on a picture by improving the shar@@ pen@@ ters . it used the copyright of the protected ab@@ norm@@ ality filter -@@ algorith@@ m of Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool is trying to raise an image of &amp; quot ; in which it creates a better approach as just to try the photo . it is using a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tering . it is often achieved better results as in@@ ser@@ p@@ ent m@@ ask . they can set it from the menu by drawing colors re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ed in the image processing .
in practice the circular folding is much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung . the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung is causing a very long tail , which depends far from the original pixel value , which is far influenced in most cases even very strongly influenced by the distant pixels . the causes un@@ wanted results .
circular blades : this is the key parameter for using this module . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . you can set a higher value if your image is very un@@ sharp if your image should be very sharp , but then on the sanc@@ tuary .
cor@@ relation : an increase in cor@@ relation can help to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the cor@@ relation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . needed values are 0,5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.95 and 0.99 . a high value for the cor@@ relation reduces the shar@@ p@@ ending effect of the module .
smoking filter : a increase in the room filter can help you cut art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values can be higher than 0,1 only rarely . if the smo@@ ker filter can be low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad . a need value is 0,03 . a high value is even further shi@@ fting the image .
Gau@@ ß &apos;s bow@@ ls : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche bow@@ ls . in most cases , you should leave this value on 0 to avoid anno@@ ying art@@ ef@@ acts . in most cases , you should also use this value un@@ equal to zero , so you may also increase the cor@@ relation and / oder@@ m filter .
mat@@ ory size : this value determines the size of the transform@@ ational size can have good results , especially if you choose large values for circular bow@@ ls or the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche bow@@ ls . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save as and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ed parameters you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded for later .
try all the cutting , color - and integer structures on the picture before using the module .
otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image . the reason for this is that lots of operations changes they are not immediately visible , but later are in@@ accurate art@@ ef@@ acts .
if you want to read and compres@@ sed , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compres@@ sed image .
generally produced un@@ sharp mas@@ cot better results as shar@@ p@@ ens . this could be caused by it , the bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king uses a larger neighborhood than shar@@ p@@ ens .
theore@@ tically , has to be seen bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king always generate Art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimal conditions it can never show the effect of the FI@@ R Vienna filters . practical is the result of the FI@@ R Vienna filters . practical is the result of the FI@@ R Vienna filters . the FI@@ R Wiener Filter is often better in the processing of small details .
below you can view a comparison between different filters , on a small un@@ focused picture , see :
the original un@@ sharp color picture has to be corrected . this picture was done with a analogue camera . the in@@ focused result is attri@@ buted to in@@ sufficient light for the car @-@ focus lens .
for more information on the methods of shock absor@@ bers in dig@@ iti@@ s you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the regul@@ ator Gl@@ ät@@ te raises the in@@ ac@@ ces of the en@@ patient of the dis@@ patient , in order to create a natural P@@ up@@ ille .
the color tin@@ te allows a adapted color for the P@@ up@@ ille . if you want to set blue eyes instead of dark , then you can set it here .
the instrument image error structure is one of the most advanced tool to remove the desired art@@ ef@@ acts with un@@ preced@@ ented speed .
the In@@ tro@@ algorith@@ m was developed by I@@ GE Team of GRE@@ C C@@ N@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ imper@@ g project .
this tool contains various pre@@ fixes than starting points to simplify the restoration . the available settings are at the bottom :
if you want to use the filter settings on a j@@ us@@ hing you can use the tab gl@@ yp@@ ing and advanced settings .
detailed view p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controlled the maintenance of details . a small value leads to a smooth @-@ smo@@ othes and details scru@@ b . a value of 0,9 should details so that no shar@@ p@@ ens can be identified . please note that the details can always be sub@@ ordin@@ ated and should be sub@@ ordin@@ ated .
automatic ad@@ diction of Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smo@@ othes the same in all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you can produce a film gr@@ itt or CCD rob@@ bers will produce a high value of wave @-@ related patterns . JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value in the vicinity of 1 .
smo@@ othes &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum gl@@ ass@@ ment factor above all el@@ se@@ . p defines the relative humidity . put this value to the degree of smoking in your picture .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects bigger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is necessary , because it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ en@@ ze@@ es , it must be higher than 3 .
re@@ peti@@ tions : returns to how often the algorith@@ m is run . normally here is 1 or 2 .
angle @-@ grad@@ ual da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ ot@@ rop@@ en Alpha . if Alpha is chosen , it should also be small . bew@@ are sure that small angle will create a long term . you should therefore choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs .
integr@@ at@@ al st@@ ing@@ span &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integr@@ ale st@@ ing@@ span in pixels . you should avoid the value of small 1 , to avoid sub @-@ pixels and never bigger than 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the More and quality you receive by choosing this option is only minor . he dou@@ bled but the term . we therefore recommend it for him .
the buttons Save as and loading exactly this . each setting of image error can be saved in a text file and later be loaded again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; image error is compar@@ atively very fast at work . it can still take very long and take a high CPU load to move . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
below you can see how imag@@ ef@@ eller with little art@@ ef@@ acts removed . the module is made on a photo that is used in Guatemala City with a an@@ alo@@ gen camera . as you see there is a peculi@@ ar black Art@@ ef@@ akt in the for@@ eg@@ round that is caused by a poor sound@@ proo@@ fing during the trip . the origin@@ ation is below ( 1 ) and the cor@@ rec@@ ated picture under ( 2 ) .
the &amp; dig@@ i@@ came ; smoking is a very powerful tool to reduce images . it uses a protected algorith@@ m by Peter H@@ eck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filter to remove cur@@ es and other arti@@ facts that come from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sens@@ or@@ ers from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ hood ; -@@ effects of ein@@ ges@@ c@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information on sens@@ or@@ ers of digital cameras , so you can read this in English in this tutorial .
the scre@@ enshot of the top shows a typical scene which has been made with a Dig@@ ital@@ kam@@ era and high ISO sensitivity . it shows a bright living room which can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you need only the sub@@ window Details and the sub@@ window advanced settings may remain in standard settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for filters . great values increase the time the filter per pixels and can be found the image within the image and the color in it is expl@@ ored and thus minor errors .
shar@@ pen@@ ing : controlled the pixel distance from the filter to the front look around lumin@@ ous changes . if it will need to change the edges filter , if you need to change this setting . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can no longer be preserved and smo@@ kers or lubric@@ ate it back .
edges : controlled the cant@@ onal im@@ precision of the filter . if it is too strong , cannot be able to do the entire smoke . put it on a value next to the maximum , if you want to remove an watch@@ strap or JPEG arti@@ facts without losing details .
illumin@@ ated : controlled the lumin@@ ance toler@@ ances of the image . we recommend either to change color or illumination to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the break@@ down process by the details of the settings .
color : controls the color toler@@ ance of the image . we recommend either to change color or illumination to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the break@@ down process by the details of the settings .
Gamma : controlled the gam@@ mat@@ orium of the image . this value can be used to increase the toler@@ ances of dark areas , which typically consu@@ me stronger . it also generates the shadow .
At@@ ten@@ uation : controls the adjustment of the ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ igs . if it is raised how quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius is respon@@ sive . if it is raised to high , the edges may appear . if he can appear on his minimum , can remove smoke and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter at the edges . he can remove smoking and is the recommended method for it .
save and store : these buttons are used exactly for them . all parameters for the smo@@ othing that you have set , can be saved into the fil@@ esystem and later loaded .
this is an example of how smoke reduction your lives can change . the origin@@ ation is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the smoking was applied with default settings .
sometimes a picture is a cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution to record the picture is a bit easier than an image . use this tool to soft@@ ening soft@@ ens and experim@@ ent with the smo@@ othes . the preview window on the right side of the dialog displays the effect of this operation to your photo .
the &amp; dig@@ i@@ came ; photo Rest@@ oration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo@@ graphic tools .
this filter for rest@@ au@@ ration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of undes@@ irable art@@ ef@@ acts of your images . it is very well adapted to Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sches Rau@@ ster , Kr@@ atzer , Com@@ pres@@ sion@@ ef@@ acts and local bugs will emerge in digital , original or re@@ bear@@ able pictures , thus gets the content as well as the human eye makes .
the same algorith@@ m can be used for d@@ yes and tex@@ tur@@ ers . the algorith@@ m to restoration works . the algorith@@ m to restoration work was developed by the IMA@@ GE Team of GRE@@ C C@@ N@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fr@@ ann@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ imper@@ g project .
JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : the comp@@ ression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas , it creates some comp@@ resses &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ak@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that are correct in the un@@ compres@@ sed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the buttons Save as and loading exactly this . each setting of photo Rest@@ oration can be saved into a text file and later be loaded again .
photo Rest@@ oration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . it can still take very long and take a high CPU load to move . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b .
below you can reduce as a photo with lik@@ eness smo@@ ker .. The module is applied to a Black and White photo that has been recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( TM ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a Sensi@@ tivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the touch film gr@@ itt on the faces . the origin@@ ation is below ( 1 ) and the corrected below ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time has been tex@@ tures to an old color photo that was applied with a scanner , which can be seen by the Sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lights and the photo op@@ ap@@ ier . the origin@@ ation is below ( 1 ) and the cor@@ rec@@ ated picture under ( 2 ) .
the &amp; dig@@ i@@ came ; tool verti@@ ces allow it to remove it with a CCD camera , eight were to remove . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pix@@ i project that are copyrighted by Martin Dick@@ h .
bright , total or my name pixels are particularly high @-@ quality raw mode photos , as many cameras with JPEG comp@@ ression about an built @-@ in repression for my name pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; name pixel ; and &quot; quot ; bright pixel ; on a photo with a dark @-@ image sub @-@ method method . there are currently no manual method to select the poor pixels .
download this file into the assist@@ ants with the button @-@ screen . the tool is automatic the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the fores@@ ight .
if you have an old Dig@@ ital@@ kam@@ era , it is important for you to discover the dark picture directly in the connection to discover new names or bright pixels by the CCD set .
first , as described in the previous paragraph , you should download the right dark picture to the corrected image . an automatic processing of the dark @-@ image will find the bad pixels . watch the last dark @-@ image and this automatically loads back in the next session .
the image area and the th@@ umb@@ nail will help you to correct the result . the preview display shows the output of the filter with the current settings . poor pixels are highlighted in all pre@@ disp@@ osition .
select an area around the def@@ ective pixels on the preview and the results of the fil@@ ters . select then the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ der these pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
thir@@ st : it will be an average of the neighbor@@ hoods . the resulting color will be assigned to all def@@ ective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels the one distance from the pixel block , are pul@@ led to the calculation of a bi @-@ lin@@ ear@@ en surface ( 2 @-@ DIM ) or a group of lin@@ ear@@ en cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ DIM ) or a group of lin@@ ear@@ en cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ DIM ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ish the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard fil@@ ter@@ method . all pixels with a distance from 2 or less to the pixel block , to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ DIM ) or a group of square cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ DIM ) or a group of square cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ DIM ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ish the pixels in the block .
Cub@@ an : all pixels with a gap of 3 or less will be pul@@ led to calculate a bi @-@ Cub@@ an interface ( 2 @-@ DIM ) or a group of Cub@@ an cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ DIM ) or a group of Cub@@ an ves ( 1 @-@ DIM ) or a group of Cub@@ an pixels in the block to inter@@ pol@@ ish .
below you can see the hot@@ ly correction on a color photo , from a def@@ ective dig@@ ital@@ kam@@ era with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure to see . the original value was increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; dig@@ i@@ came ; Vign@@ ti@@ ci@@ fix@@ ture is a tool to correct the v@@ ign@@ ation , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image .
far angle @-@ objective , especially the medium and large photo format , you can often over@@ look the whole sens@@ ory area . instead &amp; quot ; v@@ ign@@ et@@ ect@@ en@@ quot ; ( sch@@ at@@ ched ) they can reduce the ners and ri@@ bb@@ ons of the image by which the light shows the sensor there . Tel@@ e@@ objective show under circumstances also this act .
but he also has down@@ sides . many center @-@ filter need a factor 1.5 or 2 at the flash filter , which it impossible it impossible to hold the camera with the hand . far angle @-@ objective , even with center filter , an opening from f / 16 or less , as otherwise un@@ shar@@ p@@ effects by movement arise .
with the great sor@@ rows of today &apos;s film and color @-@ grad@@ uation of current filters and film @-@ scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ oval transformation in a raw image which is being used without such filters . the tool is v@@ alled by a C@@ enter@@ filter on a picture . the algorith@@ m is protected by John Wal@@ ker .
with three controllers you can control the v@@ ign@@ or@@ ative approach and with three further the exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of lighting control at the point of the biggest density filter by 1 , or by chance of a optical filter of 2 , ent@@ angl@@ .@@ build the density to compens@@ ate for a greater degree of Vign@@ ation , reduce it to a small degree .
Leu@@ ch@@ ule , contrast and Gamma @-@ settings : the Edi@@ ting of an image with the v@@ ign@@ ation correct structure reduces the lumin@@ ous thickness of the pixels . you must re@@ dire@@ cts the exposure of the target image with these options . the Reg@@ ler provide you only positive values as you only need to increase the settings just .
if you want a fine rest@@ ing of the target image , so let the values for lumin@@ ous / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the Grad@@ uation from the &amp; dig@@ i@@ came ; image processing out of the menu color grad@@ ation .
this is an example of the v@@ ign@@ or@@ ative approach to a picture . the origin@@ ation panel ( 1 ) shows the v@@ ign@@ ation in the corners and ( 2 ) the cor@@ rec@@ tive image . an Leu@@ ch@@ strength@@ ens and Con@@ tra@@ st@@ op@@ last@@ y was also carried out in the image with this tool .
the &amp; dig@@ i@@ came ; L@@ ins@@ ing is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a protected algorith@@ m from David H@@ od@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric dist@@ or@@ ations . col@@ oured dist@@ or@@ ations can not be corrected with this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second gr@@ ades covers the general geomet@@ rical dist@@ or@@ tion of the lens , and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ v@@ ex form of the image .
the co@@ efficient of the third Gr@@ ades has a similar Broad@@ casting , but to the edges above . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the co@@ efficient fourth gr@@ ades corrected the distant corner opposite the second gr@@ ades . if you combine these two can be eliminated any geomet@@ ric dist@@ or@@ ation almost eliminated .
in general : this value determines the strength of the dist@@ or@@ tion of the second cr@@ ades . with negative values can be corrected , and positive values can be corrected and positive values .
corner : this value determines the strength of the dist@@ or@@ tion fourth gr@@ ades . this value affects the marg@@ ins than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses the &apos; corner parameters has the &apos; corner parameters for the parameters of the parameter .
zo@@ om : this value is new and leads to a correction first gr@@ ades through . negative values increase in positive the image .
bright : this value j@@ us@@ ts the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values reduce the brightness of the image into the corners , while positive values they increase .
to help you find the best filter settings , illustr@@ ated the dialog with a preview the dist@@ or@@ ative correction . the values that you use for your image will be saved and used as default values as default .
the clock or c@@ is@@ sen@@ ing correction should be performed prior to all states or sizes . best lead to this correction than all the first by . if you want to create a picture and then do a tons @-@ shaped correction would be the effect of Fal@@ ster .
to help you find the best correction to help you find this tool a vertical and a horizontal assistance line . move it to an important place , such as the bottom , or a building button , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines on this point . after connection you can correct the tons @-@ shaped con@@ stri@@ ving with the help of the lines .
if you want to correct a k@@ is@@ sen@@ y dist@@ or@@ tion , the resulting image of black corners . you can transform these with the cutting tool in the menu , cutting from the image processing or through the zo@@ om Reg@@ ler of this dialog .
for most pictures the tons of select correction . the next logical step for some moti@@ ves like e.g. photographs from the front , frame and paintings , it is the perspective to correct all angle in the picture 90 degrees . please note that if you have the camera with your hand you will always keep a slight exchange of perspective .
this is an example of the combination @-@ shaped correction to a church in Norway . the origin@@ ation is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture under ( 2 ) .
the algorith@@ m is based on a method to sim@@ ulate of infr@@ ared film of G@@ imp@@ gur@@ u@@ .org website that are re@@ produced using the known Il@@ ford ( TM ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ infr@@ a film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for the preview . if you look at the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
beneath the preview you can adjust two parameters set film gr@@ itt and film gr@@ ating ( ISO ) . activate the option for one high delicate movie . the ISO Reg@@ ler changed the amount of film gr@@ itt and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in the transformation . green fields are white as snow !
since the filter color can@@ als to re@@ produce from infr@@ ared film , especially the Grün@@ kan@@ al makes it no sense to use the effect on Black / White @-@ photos as the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infr@@ ared edge of New Zealand . the origin@@ ation of New Zealand is under ( 1 ) and the original picture under ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a sort of au@@ ra in the top .
the &amp; dig@@ i@@ came ; filter film gr@@ itt is an easy to use tool to re@@ produce film gr@@ itt on your images . this is known by classic high @-@ speed films , such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X , well @-@ known . to increase the sensitivity of films through the manufacturers great sil@@ ver@@ ner of photo em@@ ul@@ sion .
the film gr@@ unt@@ ains gives your photo a certain mood or seems to post@@ pon@@ ed into the past . the treated image gets a tempor@@ al atmosphere of daily life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , road@@ photo@@ graphic , gr@@ acious sight especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ b photos , so you must use this filter .
with the Reg@@ ler , the ISO sensitivity can be adjusted to the control of intensity and gran@@ ularity of the bask@@ ets . the default value is , although frequently higher values need to be adjusted to ISO @-@ 2400 , so you can apply the filter several times more times .
this is an example of the film gr@@ unt@@ ain on a black / white picture . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and this worked the ( 2 ) . the used film @-@ sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; dig@@ i@@ came ; filter oil painting generates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorith@@ m by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; dig@@ i@@ came ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . natural pictures and still life are good for this effect .
there are two shelves to influence this effect . the upper brush el@@ ect the brush size between one and five out . di@@ ck@@ ere brushes are better for large pictures . gl@@ ed control the smo@@ othes or , from the other side looks , the sh@@ iss .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original value is marked with the ( 1 ) and which worked with the ( 2 ) . Pin@@ sel@@ Size for this 640 pixels large picture is 1 and smo@@ othing 17 .
the &amp; dig@@ i@@ came ; filter coal drawing are used color - and intensity , so stres@@ ses their gra@@ dient in the drawing are stres@@ ses . images whose gra@@ dient are slowly chosen for this effect . it is helpful if you imag@@ ined yourself to pick out the scene . this would be good pictures to start with it .
there are two shelves with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regul@@ ator el@@ ects the tab@@ ular size and the lower j@@ us@@ ts the contrast ( Gl@@ ät@@ te ) .
this is an example of the carbon blocks . the original picture ( 1 ) and the changed picture ( 2 ) . the standard settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved by modification of the level .
the &amp; dig@@ i@@ came ; filter Gra@@ v@@ ur shows your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ acked in wax . it uses a protected algorith@@ m of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; dig@@ i@@ came ; filter Gra@@ v@@ ur is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . he works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important in the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ d@@ like landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast to the fil@@ tering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default .
this is an example of the Gra@@ v@@ ur filter . the original one ( 1 ) and the worked picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this fil@@ tering group you can transform a normal photo into a artwork by means of dist@@ or@@ atory trans@@ forms . it uses protected algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
shaft loc@@ s 1 : shares the image in cells and it lets it look like it is considered through glass blocks .
shaft loc@@ s 2 : analog to the w@@ av@@ b@@ loc@@ s 1 the image is broken here with a different version of glass b@@ loc@@ s .
some effects require long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can cancel this effects anytime with the kno@@ b .
with this fil@@ tering group you can transform a normal photo into a artwork by means of dis@@ shar@@ p@@ ens effects . it uses protected algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zo@@ gen@@ ial : do not know the picture along st@@ ern@@ ical lines that eman@@ ates from a center . this sim@@ ulates the un@@ shar@@ ks a zo@@ om@@ iting camera and thereby generates a dynamic expression of often in the sport @-@ photo@@ graph .
radi@@ ale Un@@ shar@@ k : rec@@ u@@ ated the picture by rotation of the pixels around a center . this sim@@ ulates the shar@@ p@@ ens of an turned camera .
removal her@@ b : do the picture to create the effect of a non @-@ focused cam@@ er@@ al@@ se . the object appears to step back into the back .
moving so@@ ap : b@@ lowing the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this sim@@ ulates the in@@ shar@@ p@@ ens of a linear , z : B : from a car or train photograph@@ ing , camera .
soft@@ ens shar@@ p@@ ens : compar@@ ing the picture fl@@ ush in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this is created photos with a dre@@ am@@ ful and sh@@ iny soft foc@@ uss@@ ing effects ( Hamilton Eff@@ ect ) . this is ideal for creating a romantic portra@@ its , gl@@ am@@ our photos or to add a warm and subtle glass .
Sch@@ üt@@ tel@@ ep@@ ap : b@@ lowing the image by acci@@ dental shift from the pixels and sim@@ ulates the im@@ ens of a arbit@@ r@@ ary camera .
intelligent intoler@@ ances : finds the color bas@@ ins in the picture and change those without change the rest .
Mosai@@ c : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then created it , by filling with an average pixel value , new .
some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the kno@@ b .
the Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es are a cute little tool to make Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es on your picture . thus , it gives natural your images a n@@ asses appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n protected by protected algorith@@ m .
comfort size allows the size of the tro@@ p to change . since the dro@@ pl@@ et size is no longer necessary to reduce the size for small images . quantity changes the number and density of drops . Fisch@@ au@@ gen changes the optical effect of the drop in the image .
you can use the &amp; dig@@ i@@ ding ; image processing one area freely from Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es . use the selection tool to choose the area , for example a face which should remain freely . if you start to start the filter Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es will remain free of reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es .
this is an example of reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ y Fil@@ ters . the original artist ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the edited picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the standard values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , so you can bring it by sp@@ elling or rot@@ ating in the right orientation . tools can be found in the menu transform or transform sp@@ y .
photo up@@ b@@ lowing is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minim@@ alist loss of image quality .
a picture to cl@@ ans is simple . the big question is how you can find a picture fl@@ bub@@ bles and the details re@@ bl@@ ur ? how can you find the missing information again ? how can you find the missing information again or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorith@@ m which here is used here makes a good work . try him and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can change it on the desired size with the tool size . select the size change in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is below .
the tool to change the size is a linear excursion method to enlarge the pixel value . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to bub@@ bles .
many educational programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; dig@@ i@@ came ; use a further developed approach . the underlying algorith@@ m photo asc@@ ents was developed by I@@ GE Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ imper@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in the rider New dimensions and are shown below :
aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled by entering the new size the aspect ratio of the original value of the origin@@ ation .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects bigger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is necessary , because it is difficult to cher@@ ish the geometry of the image . even if you want to produce a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effects , it must be higher than 3 .
the buttons Save as and loading are exactly used for this . any one st@@ ables for photo larger can be saved as a text file and later be loaded again .
photo up@@ b@@ lowing is very fast when it makes it , but it can still take very long and take a high CPU load to move . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b .
you can see below an example for photo up@@ loaded by a small color picture . the original is enlarged ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the Pre@@ view ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard enlargement to the comparison .
the cutting of photos is not only a frequent surgery , but also a frequent tool to put together a picture . the image processing allows you to create a photo with the mouse , by pressing the mouse and drop the right purpose , then you will see this rect@@ angle then you will see the mouse .
if you put the mouse button again , the area of the photos will be cut off . thus you can change the size of the right direction . you can easily create the size of the rect@@ angle . a new rect@@ angle can simply create by clicking on the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cross @-@ section , use the button @-@ down button in the tool@@ bar and the photo is tailored ( c@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries to save the file and save the newly created photo .
in the th@@ umb@@ nail , you can change the size of the right to move the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in dialog remains intact .
in the tool following aspect ratio , you can specify orientation as a high @-@ format or format format . in the high @-@ format , the larger value of the height and the cross @-@ format is assigned to the width .
the tool after aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . that means that it is always the same , regardless of whether you can use , In@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see example below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their side aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there exist two buttons around the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or vertical .
below within the dialog with the Max . relationship Kn@@ opf can cut down the area to access to the greatest possible , depending on the selected relation and orientation .
the tool after aspect ratio , its settings vary depending on the image orientation ( Horiz@@ ont@@ al or Ver@@ tical order ) . if you use the whit@@ ew@@ ing System ( Horiz@@ ont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . the changed image dimensions will be reflected in the EX@@ IF @-@ tables , so that the EX@@ IF data will be reflected in the EX@@ IF data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings of the aid aid will help you to put your images better . these help are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic particles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ regul@@ arity , are harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles a way to share a rect@@ angle in similar tri@@ angles to share the di@@ agon@@ als .
golden middle : the golden middle is a spac@@ ing onto various natural growth sm@@ u@@ ster , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us sh@@ ells or the bl@@ ems of a sun@@ flower . it de@@ ed in all possible things that we can see as beautiful .
the golden division is the ir@@ rational number 1,6@@ 18@@ 03@@ 39@@ 88 ... and she was already used for the ancient Egyptians . artist and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put your photos , buildings and even photos together to put your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i episode 1 , 2 , 3 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where every number after 1 equ@@ als the sum of their two pro@@ gres@@ sing numbers . the resulting di@@ visor is 1 : 1.@@ 618 the golden middle . a composition that this rule is followed as vis@@ ually harmon@@ ious .
the golden middle represents liquid help routes if you put a picture together . these help are placed below :
the Gol@@ dene spiral will bring you your goal good results for your photos . compared to the third @-@ reg@@ el produces a liquid line of the eye through the picture . this type of composition leads the view of the spect@@ ator along the spiral line and created on this kind a symmet@@ rical visual river .
a further rule are the rect@@ angles of the golden spiral , also golden rect@@ angles . it should give something that the eye can be at the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects . this something can simply be there without the eye , it will fulfill his task .
the Gol@@ ds tri@@ angles also forward from the above discussed g@@ ild@@ ed Spir@@ als . their verti@@ ces of the sides of the golden tri@@ angles , are not in contrast to harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles no same tri@@ cky tri@@ angles . di@@ agon@@ ale on those lines can place a static object of dynam@@ ically .
if you use golden tri@@ angles to make your frame around your frame . try to place an effect of the professional photo@@ graph dynamic Symmet@@ ry . try to place your image fl@@ ok@@ us at one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can easily achieve .
the options are mir@@ r@@ ally reflect and reflect , to reflect the harmon@@ ic particles .
with the kno@@ b color you can set the color of the aid lines . if you can use a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the aid lines can be invisible . in this way you can customize the color of the lines of your current picture .
the free rotation is a tool to turn a picture to any angle .
if you make a photo , then it happens easily that you are not exactly vertical or horizontal . this creates an image in which the things around a angle . you can fix this with the &amp; dig@@ i@@ p ; image processing and the tool free rotation . select to transform your free rotation , and j@@ us@@ hing the target angle .
turn your picture with the sli@@ ders angle . the values on this sli@@ ders are stated in degrees . with the kno@@ b , you can put the sli@@ der on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image will be shown on the right top .
to help your help is the module Free Rot@@ ation a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse cursor to fix the two lines . after you put it on an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now j@@ us@@ ts the angle as described in the previous section .
after you have a picture , you will find un@@ wanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix it is the function transform out of the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the picture is automatic to cut . select one of the following options :
the option anti @-@ ali@@ asing is smo@@ othes the picture a bit after the rotation . please note the above warning .
all the prosp@@ ective transform@@ ations are performed by a fix@@ point of the reference point . this point is represented in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares to the corners of your image . the preview will be automatically reset . on the right of the dialog , you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by transformation , in pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by transformation , in pixels .
angle left : displays the current angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle right at the upper right corner : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right of the transformed area .
angle left : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right down : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after the adjustment of the perspective the picture becomes a little compound . for a single adaptation is this effect small , but two adjustments generate an twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after which you have adapted the perspective , you get un@@ treated tri@@ angular holes in the corner . a possibility to down@@ ing this is the image to transform out of the image processing .
the tool @-@ tool is used to move part of the image into one direction and move the other portion of the image to the right and the lower part after the left . this is no rotation , the image is dist@@ orted . with other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a Parall@@ el@@ ogra@@ m . you can transform this module via transform .
see your picture by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle . you can draw horizontal and vertical time . if you press releases , the angle will be shown on zero . a preview of the effects will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown on the right of the th@@ umb@@ nails .
to your help , a vertical and horizontal line appears . move your mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines to fix your picture .
after which you have carried out the loop , the picture becomes a bit wis@@ er . for a single note , this effect is usually negl@@ igi@@ ble , but two shots are dou@@ bled as much as ign@@ or@@ ating and therefore you should avoid this .
after the sh@@ ear , the picture has im@@ beautiful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate this is to transform the image with transform out of image processing .
&amp; dig@@ i@@ came ; needs a number of libraries and other packages to read and write . the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , from the species like these libraries comp@@ ili@@ es , you will be able to edit a large number of sculp@@ tor with &amp; dig@@ i@@ ties ;
due to this depen@@ dency on other libraries it is impossible to specify a list of all on their system available file formats . you will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF below .
&amp; dig@@ i@@ came ; only files in formats used to know . if the extension is listed in the list . if the extension is listed in the list . you can change this list of file extensions . you can change this list of file ext@@ ensively . in the section configuration you will find further information on this .
almost all digital cameras will save photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras allow you even to select the users . a detailed description of this file formats you can find in Wikipedia . &amp; dig@@ i@@ came , supports both formats .
image comp@@ ression is the application of data comp@@ ression drive to digital pictures . thereby redund@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data on a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally there are better , gl@@ atter@@ y results as JPEG at the same comp@@ resses . the 2000@@ s version can also be los@@ s@@ freely when this is stated in the settings .
if you want to know more about the raw format , so you can read at Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in colour very helpful instructions in English or TI@@ FF . in the section configuration you will find further information on the use of modules with &amp; dig@@ i@@ ties ;

many tools you need the photo editing are within &amp; dig@@ i@@ came ; they contain . your description follows here .
all images tools such as shar@@ pen , soft@@ ens , bl@@ ur@@ ish mas@@ king , &amp; etc ; . use a Single dialog , which will display the effect on the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; tex@@ ture ; in this dialogue :
( 1 ) : this progress report shows the status of the filter on the current picture . links of it allow five buttons to change the same @-@ smo@@ othing area of the sw@@ ing@@ area . these modes are :
vertical share without duplic@@ ates . the left section shows the original and right shows the filters applied to the field on the right of the selected pre @-@ saving power .
horizontal , without duplic@@ ates . the above area shows the original and the lower displays the filter to be applied to the area below the selected preview .
vertical . the left section shows the original and right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontal . the upper area shows the original and the lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; -@@ style : displays the preview when the mouse is not in the th@@ umb@@ nails and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn off to display Over@@ - and under@@ exposed colors . the used colors can be adapted in the general introduction page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the Pre@@ view . you can see this frame with the mouse inside the image and see the part of the picture , from which you will see di@@ e@@ preview . the Pre@@ view in the left part of dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your default values . all adjustable scr@@ ut@@ ches from the final use of the module .
the page row features shows the essential information on the selected image and is largely made . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
Photo@@ properties : shows a summary of the most important parameters during the shoot of the photos . this data comes from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this rider represents a intui@@ tively ticket based on the Mar@@ ble @-@ Mini@@ program . you can click with the mouse wheel or move it to a square . left C@@ tr@@ l ; lin@@ ker mouse button are fil@@ tered and displayed . this is of course ahead of your pictures Ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used for processing color pal@@ ettes and to choose color and ren@@ aming colors .
the pall@@ ets files that are installed by &amp; KDE ; can either apply to the whole system or only one user . in the latter case they are in your Personal folder for &amp; KDE ; -@@ settings and hot user defined color and fil@@ ing colors .
in the dialogue range you can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets or browse the folder according to files .
the cursor is displayed in the pallet view as line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows the colour next . the color is described under the pallet view . here , the color name can be changed .
he can also be used to choose . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor next to move . then move the mouse over the left mouse button .
if the re@@ bel@@ e@@ feld Bei@@ m cursor is enabled under the kno@@ b color , the color is inserted in the color board at the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes a different ; depending on whether the mode can be over@@ write . this mode can you set by clicking the tick @-@ box under Bei@@ m cursor .
a selection which has been created just as described in the last section , along with the actions copying , cut and insert them .
&amp; c@@ color@@ ations ; use the following format for data in cli@@ p@@ board tray : for each colour three values for the shares of red , green and blue and a visual color , if another color follows . if so , three numer@@ ical values in the cli@@ p@@ board can be added as one color in &amp; k@@ color@@ ations ;
colors in the palette and output of the colours can be drawn with the mouse .
you can choose a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color dr@@ ill on the left side .

the main window shows the open graph@@ s , each in a separate sub@@ windows ; without an argument , the main window will be opened as in the lower scre@@ enshot . in this case the tool@@ bar contains only the icon file and the ( empty ) list included . click on the first symbol to view the dialog file .
after you choose one or more &amp; dot ; files selected the main window looks like in the lower scre@@ enshot :
as you can see , an overview will be displayed in the corner when the Grap@@ h is bigger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically .
the mouse wheel use ( high and r@@ unter without special buttons , left and right at the left &amp; old ; -@@ button ) ;
the zo@@ om is restricted in both directions by the factor of 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph@@ s .
if the straight in &amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; joint file has been modified from another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the Grap@@ h are to be re@@ loaded or if you want to change the change . &amp; k@@ graphy . if you want to change your decision later , you may use your decision later , you can set the menu item settings k@@ graph@@ s ; Start ... see also .
if you open a graph cl@@ ei outside of a current &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; the instance will open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; the instance do you want to display a new &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; the instance do not want to display a new &amp; k@@ graphy .
as with the final option you can permanently save your choice but also to change it with the correct dialog .
at the program start , you can open all graph@@ s of your last meeting again . again , you can save your choice both as well as later .
you can also specify how the Grap@@ h can be divided into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be chosen freely .
if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph@@ s , which are shown on one page , the aspect ratio shall be ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph@@ s .
side @-@ show with one on several sides shared graph@@ s without head@@ line and with another font
the page again displays the possibility to specify the behavior if a file has changed onto the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can have a standard behaviour ( automatically rest@@ oring or modify the changes ) or the program every time .
the page Op@@ ens gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; if a Grap@@ h opened outside of a current session . you can open a standard behaviour for this case ( the graph@@ s opened in a new window or determine the current session ) or determine that each time is asked for each time .
the page description management gives the possibility to set the starting behaviour of &amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; to set up a standard behaviour ( the files of the last session or not ) , or determine when you are asked afterwards .
the context menu , which usually appear with a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; appears , open more possibilities :
here you can choose between different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Lay@@ out@@ algorithms . the entries are described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&amp; dot ; -@@ algorith@@ m , the standard for gr@@ ated graph@@ s . it produces hierarch@@ ical or historical represent@@ ations of gr@@ ated graph@@ s . the algorith@@ m lays the edges in the same direction ( from top to right ) and then tried to produce as short ones and as a few cant@@ ons .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; -@@ algorith@@ m is the standard for un@@ eri@@ ed graph@@ s . it produces depic@@ tions under the jumping mat . in this case the Kam@@ ada @-@ Kaw@@ ai @-@ algorith@@ m is used with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; -@@ algorith@@ m creates for un@@ eri@@ ed graph@@ s a jumping mat model -@@ layout . it uses the fruit @-@ man cleaner for the treatment of great and g@@ ec@@ lu@@ ster@@ ed graph@@ s .
the &amp; cir@@ co ; -@@ algorith@@ m sorts the k@@ not @-@ shaped approach in accordance with the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and meadow , 2002 . he is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cy@@ cli@@ c structures .
opens up a dialog , where you can give a layout error , which will then accept the Grap@@ hic layout of the graph@@ s after st@@ d@@ out in the x@@ dot format . with such a special layout ; -@@ algorithms special options give , or even the graph@@ s with a filter off , before it is drawn .
determines the type of graph@@ s ( or un@@ resolved ) and turns the standard algorith@@ m for the respective type of ( dot ; for gr@@ ated , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ ed graph@@ s ) .
if this setting is activated , the overview will be displayed , if this is necessary . otherwise it is not displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
shows the What is the mouse @-@ cursor . click with this mouse cursor to a &amp; GUI ; -@@ Element to get more help to this element ( if available ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and in the file Ch@@ angel@@ og in the base of the source archive .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; is a &amp; KDE ; -@@ program that uses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tools for presentation . it needs the following programmer :
a particular dec@@ or is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ graphic viewer . in the menu setting you will find more options .
the main window of the symbol Edi@@ tors is divided into five areas : the main tool@@ bar , the bar for drawing tools , the color bar , the .@@ color palette and the Git@@ tern@@ etz , in which you draw the symbol .
created a new symbol . if the current file was changed , you will be asked if you want to save the changes . afterwards , a dialogue where you can choose whether the symbol of a template is to be created , or if you want to re@@ boot from the reason .
introduces the final step back again . if you do not have a step back , this function is disabled .
adds the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board includes a symbol ) .
sets the current symbol in Gr@@ au@@ stages . this can produce colors that do not agree with those of the icon @-@ range of &amp; KDE .
does not change the symbol , but sets the current character @-@ color to the color of the point on which you click .
the status bar shows you the current promotions . from left to right , it shows you the X@@ - and y @-@ coordinates of the current resolution , the size of the current character surface , the mag@@ nific@@ ation factor and the current number of colours of the symbols .
adds the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board includes a symbol ) .
open with settings &amp; k@@ ic@@ on@@ edit ; establish a dialogue with the three sides templates for symbols , background and symbols .
with the buttons Ad@@ ding ... , Edit ... and Rem@@ ove you can change the templates for Standard File , Source File , Com@@ ya File &amp; etc .
choose transparent pixel or rul@@ ers to display or set @-@ color : or a ch@@ ess@@ board as Transpar@@ ency display . you can also adjust the size : the kar@@ os to Klein , means and wholes@@ ale as well as the colour 1 : and color 2 : choose .
the KI@@ PI module shows tools available to include new images and to send them to them .
this module can be used to include new pictures from external sources and send them from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
images sc@@ ans : used the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read pictures of a scanner which supports by the San@@ e project or another source such as video stre@@ ams . so that this works you need to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
if you choose the menu entry entry you will open a dialog , which you can pick up between all available sources on your computer . select here the source of which you want to get the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by selecting the default values du@@ cr@@ at to select your picture . see the preview and adjust the image below . the estimated file size is displayed in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information .
be sure that the window will be completely displayed as some settings otherwise possibly can &apos;t be displayed .
after you pushed the button sc@@ anning sc@@ anning , you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window to insert the options of image file . here you can also select the comp@@ ression and the type of image file . you must also select the folder &amp; # 160 . you must also select the folder &amp; # 160 .
scre@@ enshots you can create after you have selected in the menu Im@@ por@@ ridge &gt; Wall@@ print ... selected . a window appears in which you can adjust the various scre@@ ensa@@ vers :
select the complete desktop to read a single window below the mouse .
if all of your own programmer are selected , the up@@ loaded program will disappear , so you will see other scre@@ ens and windows . otherwise you will read a brief delay , the currently visible workplace will be read only the window below the mouse .
the delay determines how long scre@@ enshot will wait before it starts . if you have to switch to other work@@ spaces you should have to select this delay high enough to navigate the time there .
after the scre@@ enshot of the scre@@ enshot was released the dialog options of the target image with the above mentioned options .

the KI@@ PI module allows the geographic loc@@ alization , allows GPS coordinates in the met@@ adata of an image and edit . the geographic data are stored in the EX@@ IF sam@@ pling of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the KI@@ PI module for the geographical loc@@ alisation provides tools available to locate images geographic in the spher@@ ical coordinate , which is used by GPS and Galileo , to locate . height , long@@ ed and b@@ rei@@ ten@@ grade are used .
to record your images with geographical data , you need a GPS track as XML @-@ file in the g@@ px @-@ format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ p@@ sman may download the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ograph@@ ical loc@@ alization cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can lead a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images that you want to rel@@ ay in the main window and then call the menu on . the above mentioned dialog will then load a trace file with G@@ P@@ X file . this file does of course load data from the same time in the same places as the pictures of your camera .
if the file loaded a automatic cor@@ relation which displays the coordinates in red indicates . GPS Track data are recorded at GMT @-@ time and therefore the camera should be done with the GMT . this can be done with the time@@ zone . continue here your camera zone .
the setting for the maximum time devi@@ ation there is a upper devi@@ ation for the GPS @-@ time and camera . the devi@@ ation , the data is combined . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have a trace data from one place for pictures you can edit the g@@ px file manually and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then be syn@@ cing all images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in min. can be used if you have no appropriate data . if you know that in reality a loc@@ ation in a big time difference between camera and GPS is , you can set these boundaries here and then push the button cor@@ relation to inter@@ pol@@ ish .
the coordinates can be set manually by this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos on the same place . because the dialogue will use the coordinates of a call to next mer@@ kt you only need to use the button OK to put the data with the current photo .
the loc@@ ation can also be found and set according to the indicated region and enlarge En@@ e.@@ guides you will always be selected through until you have a hin@@ dering accuracy . the card can always be selected manually . the card can be changed between the mo@@ dus , satellite screen and a mixed mode .
completely outside of the KI@@ PI @-@ module , there are possibilities the GPS @-@ data to the pictures . here is a small script that the Mexican tool is used to provide a stack of pictures with GPS @-@ data .
the KI@@ PI module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in an image gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01 . you can select the albums that can be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for HTML pages . the subscription will be UT@@ F @-@ 8 to make a possible internation@@ alisation .
the module has four riders where settings can be adjusted . the rider selection allows all albums to select the files . you will need to select these albums only . with the three buttons on the right side you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the field below , the Al@@ ben@@ vor@@ es and the text of the HTML page will appear .
the tab theme defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this rider is largely made . the option for each image will also create a new page in which the image will display . otherwise , the image will be shown directly with your standard screen , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , displayed
the tab album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your associated images . select a folder containing the name KI@@ PI@@ 77@@ Export , which it contains all that will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF @-@ Information of your origin@@ ality will also be saved in the new images .
with other color deep , you can change the standard colored deep . the influences of course also influences the file size . all other settings are fixed .
the rider th@@ umb@@ nails allows you to customize some of the settings from the album tab for the th@@ umb@@ nails which are small images that are shown in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Ab@@ om@@ iting to break the process .
if the module creates the pages the window will not be automatically closed . you can therefore adjust the programmer . the web browser will automatically appear at the end to view the preview of the gallery . click the module to close the module .
the KI@@ PI image is a very fast and flexible OpenGL @-@ based tool to look at the pictures .
the KI@@ PI images allows you to see a selection of images and perform on them cor@@ on@@ ations such as rotation , zo@@ om@@ es or rel@@ oc@@ ating . the vie@@ wers can be used with du@@ ps and mouse over . he was developed for a fast image display and quick access to its functions .
after starting a picture is displayed by default in the full screen . this can be changed in a window mode .
the KI@@ PI JPEG image is a tool to change images without any of your quality .
this module allows for the actions described below , pictures in the JPEG format , without the usual losses in quality or met@@ adata .
the consequence of the fun@@ eral storage is it the file size increases , because no comp@@ ression of color information takes place . this can be found e.g. also at PNG format .
the KI@@ PI module Dig@@ ital@@ kam@@ era client is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the KI@@ PI module Dig@@ ital@@ kam@@ era , currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing them , please contact the mail@@ ing list of KI@@ PI Team under KDE @-@ Imag@@ ing @ k@@ de.@@ Georgi@@ an warning : the participants of this list speak English .
the KI@@ PI @-@ module Met@@ adata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the mail@@ ing list of KDE Imag@@ ing @ k@@ de@@ .org of the KI@@ PI Team .
with the import -@@ function of Met@@ adata option you can copy data from a picture to another . select the image that you want to copy the target files , so the image will copy the met@@ adata . the data will be copied after that you pushed to the button OK .
this function does not work in all formats . you can write from anywhere but not in any target format . JPEG is supported when writing . please check out what formats are supported .
the KI@@ PI MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a series of pictures into a MPEG video in the form of a slideshow .
the module MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer may be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . between the individual images you can also add a base file in MP@@ 2 or WAV of slideshow .
all images are automatically stored on the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can use the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the media you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first select the images that are packed into the MPEG slideshow . then you can start using extras to MPEG slideshow .
the pictures selected by you are then under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change s@@ orting of the images or the content of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should be able to customize the other settings . the video format can choose from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD , you need to select the respective TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre @-@ set and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step you should specify the time in seconds the one image is displayed below . a low value is generated very su@@ dden , a high on it is very gl@@ aze image .
the background color can be adjusted as next . in doubt you should leave it black . the name and the path of the generated file you can choose under name of MPEG @-@ output file . keep you in doing so as the En@@ ough mp@@ g .
if you specify a audio @-@ file under name of the audio source file , this is integrated into the movie . after you can start all settings your wishes . depending on speed of your computer you can now go back quickly or in all tranquility a coffee drink and the di@@ asch@@ au enjoy when you are back again .
if a note appears that Ko@@ di@@ fier or tools are missing , so you can customize the paths to the programs of M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages across the button settings on the right below .
the print driver allows more pictures on a sheet paper together in standard photo@@ sizes . the combined images can also be opened automatically with image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.@@ g : sensible to enhance you or with the Gim@@ p module for direct printing .
with this KI@@ PI module you can import your in raw format stored in one of three formats , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the Command device d@@ cra@@ w by Dave coffee in . an original sp@@ icy of Him is : expect it the same results as the software of your camera people . sometimes you get with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
select first the RAW @-@ file that should be converted and launch the module . the RAW @-@ image converted window will then be in mode for a single image . with the kno@@ b preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now optim@@ ise the values new to optimize the conver@@ sions process . the first option is decided whether the camera settings are to be used for the whit@@ eboard , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later .
a four @-@ s@@ cars R@@ GB@@ G Con@@ version can be selected to allow you to use the tra@@ p information . if your camera works in R@@ GB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switches has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the Pre@@ view , you can choose one of the three output formats and store the conver@@ sions . the fil@@ ename will be adjusted and only the extension is adapted accordingly . JPEG uses a fun algorith@@ m and produces the smallest fl@@ ashes .
the tag@@ ged Image format , TI@@ FF , ret@@ ains all the information of your image and uses the de@@ fun@@ less LZ@@ W compres@@ sing .
if you prefer your pictures frequently to edit or use later on , you should not choose the JPEG format , since there are only a limited number of operations . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the met@@ adata contained in the RAW file are stored in the JPEG file in the ex@@ if information .
if you have adapted your settings with the trigger button . if you want to cancel the conversion . if you want to cancel this process so you can use it .
the st@@ acking processing mode allows you to convert different images to once . use this mode therefore if you are sure , e.g. by p@@ est on a single picture , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , here you have the possibility to automatically over@@ write file . this is helpful if they have been created in an earlier trial . however , a preview is not available . the progress report shows how far the conversion has advanced .
this module can be used to record all images in an album compres@@ sed . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can ren@@ ame the ren@@ ame of all pictures of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start @-@ up and the new@@ line of the stamp .
this module can be used to modify the size of multiple images of a image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can use the image smaller or enlarge .
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal Gre@@ en@@ change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , selected . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : compare change in two dimensions . here remains the aspect ratio unchanged . you can use this option e.g. to adjust your image to the scre@@ enshot .
not proportional : not dis@@ proportion@@ ate modification in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed when this option is changed .
printing preparation : prepare the image for the phot@@ oc@@ ular pressure . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the phot@@ oc@@ ill@@ usion@@ ists . the target image , including background size , random size and background color , is accordingly adapted .
with this KI@@ PI module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images below . more pictures can be taken on the list of the images and get there .
after you started the module , the pictures will be displayed with the pictures selected by you . over the button images you can add with a file selection dialog . for the last modified image will display a preview on the right .
you can also drag images on the picture list and to add it to the list of the images below .
with the kno@@ b images , the selected images are removed from the list of the images to be removed .
after you selected all the pictures you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail clients here . you only need to add the addresses and the Bet@@ re@@ ff . the selected images are attached to a listing .
pay attention to many pictures at one time . most of the email accounts have limitations for the size of the e @-@ mails mails . it may be a good idea to send several emails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window will be used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and once again used to change it .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you want to select Thunder@@ bird , you need to specify in the input field below the right path for your installation .
if you use the Google Mail Service , you must install before the G@@ mail@@ agent on your computer . you can download this here .
after the election of comments in a given file the comments to the pictures will be added to a text file and attached to the mail .
the PNG format under the menu file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files such as TI@@ FF . you should therefore use it , if you have a quick Internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend you to JPEG image .
if you select JPEG image file and select the original files in the JPEG format then the original receipt will be added to the pictures .
when the process is finished , the window will not be automatically closed in order to test the status of status , in search of errors , but your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end . with the kno@@ b Connect , you can proceed to this window .
after launching the mod@@ est Di@@ asch@@ au , a window appears with questions like you want your Di@@ ash@@ au . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album .
the OpenGL transi@@ tions in the presentation are activated very elegant image outputs by OpenGL . you do not have to own a corresponding Grap@@ hic card , because otherwise the slideshow is very slow .
the option file name will show that the fil@@ ename of images are displayed in the left lower corner while the presentation will be displayed .
the loop is an option for that the presentation will be displayed in a final loop . you can manually install it manually with Es@@ c ;
the option images happen by chance that the pictures in a random order is displayed . so it will not be used the order of images in the album .
under del@@ aying the images the time distance between images can be placed between the individual images . 1500 mill@@ is@@ econ@@ ds correspond to 1,5 seconds and are a good standard . the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen subject matter . you should be inter@@ f@@ est before you show the presentation your friends !
there are more than a do@@ zen excess of which you can choose . by chance you choose from any transition between images and another effect .
during the slideshow is able to access a tool@@ bar on the top left . move the mouse into this corner to turn you into .
with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slideshow .
at the left bottom of the show you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the entire number of images in your presentation .
the KI@@ PI module takes time &amp; date , currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing them , please contact the mail@@ ing list of KI@@ PI Team under KDE @-@ Imag@@ ing @ k@@ de.@@ Georgi@@ . attention : the participants of this list speak English .
the KI@@ PI module is a tool to set up an image as the wallpaper for the work of the surface .
this module sets the currently selected picture , depending on the selected option of sub@@ menu , as background for your KDE @-@ surface .
once you have provided your images and videos with notes , you can see with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; through these brow@@ sing , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , are now available in each group , so in people , places and in the group tags .
in the browser window you can see the categories , for which you posted information as you have given your pictures and videos with notes . additionally , there are entries to look at the EX@@ IF @-@ based information , the folder structure can be seen on your hard disk and of course the current th@@ umb@@ nails . in the following , each one is described for himself .
if you press with the mouse on the entry , changes the view of the browser . see picture .
if you choose another person , only the pictures are shown on which both persons are visible . through this selection method you can restrict the number of images displayed in a few thousand pictures on a few single pictures .
if you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can display with th@@ umb@@ nails to look at the pictures of your application .
in the picture each person has the same symbol before their name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ image ; however , for each person a private preview picture , which is of course also defined for places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself . see the picture .
to view images next to the name , select the button , which you wish to use the right outside on the tool@@ bar . in the context menu , please note that you can view the view for each category separately . this has the advantage that you can have for example symbols with pictures of people and at the same time a list of keywords available ( if you don &apos;t have an appropriate images ) .
however , you need to specify which image should be displayed for each individual person . now to choose to display the image editor . now you can select the picture for the appropriate person . in the context menu , you can customize the picture factor according to your wishes and choose which part of the picture will be shown and processed .
if you set in the main window entry , will give you a dialog , which is very similar to the dialog for the strength of the picture features very similar . this dialog can look at the picture again .
if you follow a string in the field of marking or descriptions , the indic@@ t@@ ations or descriptions of the pictures after this text should be sear@@ ches , i.e. , the date can either be part of the total date , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all pictures according to certain names , as you can see in the picture . here is after pictures , on which jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are pic@@ tured .
this is the user &apos;s manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you do not like to read manu@@ als , but rather like the functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and look at the quick entry , the scre@@ enshots and the intro@@ duc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and choose the demo , in the first time you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or choose the menu help the menu entry into the photo@@ album ; -@@ demo . subsequently , some example images can be loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ;
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a co@@ her@@ ent of HTML -@@ document to download .
at the bottom of the main picture of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this body you can see here : . as the name suggests , this body shows you data about the pictures in your database .
the time bar can show you several different sched@@ ules . each Lei@@ ste shows then another unit . you can switch between the units of months , months , weeks and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by drawing up only 10 minutes .
the time bar can be inter@@ active in the following ways : you can change the shown entries from the database ( if you select a date , will show you the first image of this date in the Pre@@ view page ) and also displays the current date of the currently shown pictures , if you see in the Pre@@ view @-@ view .
you can also select a range of time to select the mouse button and drag the mouse over the rul@@ er of the tim@@ eline , so . if you select an area , you will see you in the preview view this time you can cancel the selection by clicking on a beam of the time bar .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you two options available to create HTML web pages with your images . one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated into &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version which you can create via the menu File HTML ...
before HTML pages you need to create some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and objective . in the following , each field is more accurately described .
first , enter the title of the bli@@ cks and a description which should contain the HTML file later . at k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML @-@ example pages you can see an example of these settings .
next select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file is to be created on the overview page . se@@ wing information about export files can be found in .
finally , you can select which information is shown on the HTML pages . thus , you can avoid that information is shown on the viewer . for example , all pictures of a party are . please note that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; currently all pictures can therefore not use to hide certain images from certain vie@@ wers .
in this area you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are clear , which is why this is not specifically made .
below you can adjust different resolutions for the pictures . thus , those you have to view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no pictures more than for example a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the vie@@ wers of your site can change the resolution at any time . he can search your images with low resolution , which results in a lower transmission time , search . if he wants to get a picture bigger , he changes to a higher resolution .
in this context , you place the different folder and URL where your website is stored .
the best way to choose for all of your HTML files and for each subsequent sentence a new sub@@ folder .
first , you need to select the folder , in which all your images are stored automatically . this folder will be automatically stored and select for all future pictures of the location . here you can either choose a folder or one from KDE supported protocol , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check if this really select all for vie@@ wers , a web browser , after the pages were created , started . the URL that you may be here . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the set of you created HTML files are not yet in the final target files , you need to manually copy it . so that the import function , see , right , you will not need to specify the final destination of the files , but the base of the current file , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folder .
the settings described in the settings vary all three to ground@@ folder or URLs . in these cases , a sub@@ folder created , whose name you specify in the output folder .
if you &apos;re looking at a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you might want to create a HTML page to tracking the images . if you don &apos;t want to create a HTML page to consider the image information , people on the pictures , po@@ ort , etc . you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work is not yet to do .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import@@ ing other to your database . these bil@@ ing@@ es can be import@@ ed into your database .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ if the images are stored in the file or if the file is only a link to pictures . the advantage of all the images in the file is that you may share all the pictures and this file may be so independent . the obvious dis@@ advantage is however the file size .
you can create a .@@ k@@ im file , either directly from the menu File Ex@@ porting ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file is searching for the images in a simple way . first , the images are not found , so the images of the URL that you have indicated when creating the HTML files . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export .
in the following , the dialog box is described for the export of images that you can export the File menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should act internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . it is available to you with the following three choices :
with the option Manu@@ ell to copy the .@@ k@@ im file you must copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the option automatic to copy the .@@ k@@ im @-@ file copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im -@@ files are normal Zip files . since most pictures have already been compres@@ sed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it does not normally use the files to compres@@ sed . if you want to nevertheless , just select the option export file compres@@ sed .
the last option of this page is Maxim@@ ale image size limit . if you want to send your friends pictures , since the .@@ k@@ im -@@ file else would be very large . here you can tell the size by saying that every image is at 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the en@@ dung .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file Im@@ porting ... is , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described .
the wi@@ z@@ ard to import@@ ing is made of four steps . first , you need to select which pictures you want to import it , in which folder you import the pictures to be copied .
it may be that you are common to the category of people on import@@ ed file ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) while this category is asked for your database . therefore , you are asked in the third dialog box which should be import@@ ed into import@@ ing file and which categories can be in your database .
in the fourth step you can import@@ ed the categories of the import@@ ing file with the categories of your current database . an example for this you can see on the picture .
it has to be easy to search and look at : when you see images , one wants to see often within different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you want to discover some pictures of your Italy @-@ holiday and you want to discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures , on which this friend is pic@@ tured .
in this manual you will find the different steps from the ( 1 ) drive information about your images , about ( 2 ) , through ( 2 ) to run and reputation up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adap@@ t@@ ations .
K@@ Photo@@ album was started as a program for the managing of your images . it was expanded and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual there will be talked about images , but frequently , also ex@@ cl@@ udes any videos with one .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file index@@ .@@ xml in the top folder of their pictures . this is a simple XML file that you can copy with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , backup on a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions on CV@@ S , where they want .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; mer@@ kt the folder that are stored in which your images are stored and used these with future Star@@ ts . if you want to start another folder containing images , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the option -@@ c album , as : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / pictures / index@@ .@@ xml .
through the menu entry menu k@@ photo@@ album ; entry into a window , with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following sections of the user guide will be explained to you the different settings .
left you see six different symbols which allows you to access settings and options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available to you by a key@@ press to the F1 button and one click on the desired option .
in it was described you as you can choose for each picture different properties , for example people , places and tags . you can also create your own groups like e.g. items , animals or albums .
you can see the dialog box that is used to work for already existing groups . for every existing group you can select a certificate and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories mentioned already mentioned . in dialogue options you can set up complete membership groups , i.e. , for example all members of a group on once in a group , instead of all groups of a medium gli@@ ders as described in .
in view of the setting possibilities , which are available to you with the out@@ set of the members list . with the indicated output list , you can select the category you want to configure the category . in the left window , you can configure a list of the current category and in the right one list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares his module with other graphics applications , such as dig@@ i@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called KI@@ PI and means &amp; KDE ; Image Plugin Interface . S@@ ights information can be found on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be called via the menu modules and are not described in this manual , since they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; but most modules have a help page that you can call on the modules itself .
since the modules of multiple applications are used together , it can be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little tested , you should go either via the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; us@@ er@@ mark \ &gt; or via the menu help . say not , I would not have war@@ ned !
the applications that use the modules over KI@@ PI are very different , allowing it to be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not function . this is the dis@@ advantage if you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that may also use KI@@ PI is that the other applications will not support their pictures in albums : this kind of order is not supported , sim@@ ulated it for some modules the order after albums , so you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
this sim@@ ulates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which corresponds to the current view , so all pictures , which shows you the picture @-@ show .
next to the current album must contain &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also has passed a list of albums . here , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser shows the contents of a category , for example all persons , then each entry of this category is an album for the module .
or it will be the category that you have specified in performing dialog as a category for virtual albums , is used for example , if you would like to use the category , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so if you would have chosen people to view and pass this module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start converting dialog and select the modules that can be loaded in the range modules .
on the picture you can see an example for a starting screen , as soon as you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with your own pictures .
as you are used by any other KDE application , you can easily see above a menu and a tool@@ bar . at the tool@@ bar you can &apos;t see information about your images . in the section we will return to this window , please click here again on the entry pictures show you an overview with all existing images .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the opportunity to see each picture with comments , where the picture was recorded , etc . you can bet any image either individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . if for example on all images jes@@ per is recorded and all pictures taken in Copenhagen .
all these comments can be read for the Search and Brow@@ sing as you can in the section . if you want to see these comments if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
in seeing three lists with a text box by setting people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; because they will be used again when you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea lies the rel@@ oc@@ ating of images within the list : if you have an family party and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons can be arranged , so you can find that the names used are moved up to the persons more quickly and to arrange .
if you prefer to get a alphabe@@ tical list below , click on the icon for s@@ orting by date below the list .
if you have selected notes for each image individually , you might want to edit all the selected images and provided these pictures with notes . click in this case simply click on the back and back @-@ buttons , which are under the preview of the image right at the top right .
if you have multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to select all these images and provided the menu item multiple entries with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all available in the United States . furthermore , San Francisco and Los Angeles city are in California .
on the picture you can see a browser window of the U.S. as an ad group . to show you that it is a group , a special symbol is displayed .
in the context menu of the feature dial@@ ogs it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also make an entry simply on a category and there to make this one sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this requires just your categories of alphabe@@ tical order . see this .
you can move the individual elements of the theme dial@@ ogs by putting the lad@@ der which form the upper levels of frame , click and move . you can also make a frame also a private window by entering it outside the window area .
if you have adjusted the appearance of the window so that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button options ... , which offers you the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window .
you can also use a frame also completely out . if you want to see this window later , use the button options ... and here window a / hide . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select the entry pictures in your browser , you will find an overview with th@@ umb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or all pictures if you have no filters . you can configure the size of the th@@ umb@@ nails by simple to configure the mouse with the middle mouse button . try it simple times .
if you have a picture on the background of your desktop , this picture will be set as the wallpaper for your desktop .
once you click on an image , it will be displayed in the picture lights . if you have not yet opened any window with a picture player , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the image show also images . simply select the appropriate images from which you want to delete or select either the Rem@@ ove button . now the window will be displayed that you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can also use with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; namely pictures also , without having saved the pictures somewhere , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the image you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be loaded from hard disk .
images , where the right upper corner is cut down , are not saved on the hard drive . for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 however , the th@@ umb@@ nails are available , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can display the preview of these pictures . however , you can also view these pictures with the image .
as you see , this function you need to copy files from folders and go back . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not support you to avoid the question of the concerned CD . if you would like to avoid any trouble , like the m@@ ess of your pictures , please buy a bigger hard disk to save all images on it .
in the menu you will find a sub@@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , fil@@ tering the pictures so that you can do for others and click on Current view , which can be able to see your little sister . alternatively , you can also choose your little sister , cont@@ emp@@ ower and the menu entry all except contemporary view .
with this you have set what pictures in the case of the case shall be hidden . if you give the lap@@ top of your little sister , simply select the men@@ u@@ ster entry of your little sister , then select all the images that you have locked . if you wish to see the pictures again , click D@@ erre .
it is also possible to set a password which must be set to un@@ lock the images . to adjust this password , simply select password in the menu privacy .
please remember that this picture protection is by no means very safe . for one there are all pictures on the hard disk and on the other one can read the password as un@@ encryp@@ ted text or delete this type of password protection ; not very familiar with the views of private pictures .
the reason why you manage all your images with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and hours over hours with it is of course that you want to look at some point . because of this reason , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; on a picture _ and video papers . you can start from the preview , as described in .
the viewer can you see in . it shows of course the image , but additional all the information you have shown on the picture , such as who is on the image when and where it was made , etc .
if the Info@@ box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , so you can see this simply with the mouse , and elsewhere . you can also configure what information is displayed and if all of these options are available after a right @-@ click on the viewer . the then er@@ ating context menu can be seen below .
some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined below . if you click here on the browser , see , matching entries to this show . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all pictures from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene selected .
if you have loaded several pictures in the viewer , you can use between them and go back by using the keys image high and image . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these features are also accessible from the context menu .
if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as a slideshow . how often it invites a new image after a few seconds . how often it load a new image by pressing the Str@@ g button and Plus or mines .
a very useful ability of the spect@@ ator of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is used in the full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . just use the input button to change into the full screen mode and back .
if you use the vie@@ wers you can use in the image and zo@@ zo@@ oming . to flo@@ wering . with the mouse button , you can re@@ zo@@ om the Plus button in the middle of the picture . shows how a zo@@ om sp@@ eck is marked and shows the outcome of the zo@@ om .
with the point button you can reset your zo@@ om , so that the picture is not drawn . with the equ@@ als and the zo@@ om is that each pixels on the screen of a pixels of the image corresponds .
note , that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations that work with videos that in it and zo@@ om with the plus and Minu@@ are .
with the rotation of the context menu you can turn the picture . this will not work with videos . you can do notes to the current picture using the menu item notes from the context menu .
if you look at images it can happen to put a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the image . in the moment you can enter the view and configur@@ ation dialog of the image to enter these names , but you might just drag the image to mark and see more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images on a printer to get the images on paper . to see what photos you want to start watching the vie@@ wers with the pictures and view it as good or bad , while you can view one by one .
for the two examples above , the vie@@ wers gives you the opportunity to provide features with characteristics , while you are watching them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature that you press the corresponding letter . in view the features A , B and C are set .
once you have set characteristics on your images are available in your browser . so you can see all pictures , print or whatever you have selected . afterwards , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in the th@@ umb@@ nail . if you want to display categories in DR@@ E th@@ umb@@ nail , then simply click the letters to the images by clicking the image . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case allows you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; on the image to paint .
the mixture will not be stored with the image but in the database . in the way you can re@@ use your gem@@ stone later .
in you can see a picture on the painted . to turn the painting menu from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; to turn off on the picture painting from the context menu , simply click the cross in the tool@@ bar top at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; work , you must have the application of the program &amp; Pov@@ ray ; not completely domin@@ ate , but the documentation to &amp; Pov@@ ray : should you be read and understood .
in the tree @-@ tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are shown on the properties tab and the object in the wire model - views are shown .
you can also select multiple objects simultaneously . but not the object of a already selected object , since all sub@@ properties are already selected using the object .
to add a new object into the tree tree , select the position to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu item in the menu insert .
there are different positions , the following search menu appears in , so that you can choose the correct position :
with Del@@ ete either from the menu button below or from the context menu , the right mouse button you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed properties , click on to apply these changes . you have invali@@ d values , a message is shown with a error description . then you can click on the input procedures or delete the changes with you .
if you enter the path to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user &apos;s documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ reference to the shown object with help .
you do not need the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user document to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Pov@@ ray : 3.5 contains the user reviews .
if you edit a text or part of a text files , you can view a preview in the self @-@ suffici@@ ency view .
press the preview in the equity @-@ view and a small example of the scene will have selected with the chosen tex@@ ture , even if you want to submit a sub@@ ordin@@ ated item ( for example a text file inside a text files , and not the entire tex@@ ture map ) , cru@@ el you locally .
the scre@@ enshot shows the control points of the camera . you can draw these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is chosen , the control points and there will be a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation , as well as the position for shi@@ fting . you can change the shift through shi@@ fting with your mouse inside the whole window .
each object has an exchange of visibility . you can specify this value relatively to the visibility of the higher object , or as absolute value . objects are only displayed when they are selected or its visibility in the tool@@ bar of the chosen level of the scene is .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window assignment as a default . the object tree and the view of the object appears to the left and the four graphic views are shown on the right .
if you do not like the standard assignment , or if you need a different order , you can also adjust them as desired . you can also store multiple shut@@ ters and simply change between different approaches .
to an@@ chor a window through or under a present view , drag the f@@ ake to the top or lower edge of a view . a rect@@ angle shows then the new position .
to create a new column , drag the fitting to the right or left side of a view . the new view will then be anch@@ ored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the overall height .
if you want to arrange several views onto each other , drag the f@@ ray in the middle of another view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the cart@@ ei@@ k@@ ebox top in the views .
the last possible shut@@ down views are different views : views that are not glu@@ ed in the main window . to solve a view from the an@@ chor , drag the f@@ ake on the desktop or click the small to the top of the po@@ inter row in the bor@@ row bar .
to view a view , click on the little cross in the p@@ encils . to prevent the closing , click on the little square between the arrow and the cross .
you can insert additional views in the main window . in the menu view you will find entries for any kind of views . new views are dirty , you can an@@ chor them in any point .
the current window @-@ view you can store with view window and save . it will be a dialog box in which you can store the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can use ren@@ dering . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; 3.@@ 1g to ren@@ dering , this program has to be properly installed . when this manual was written , &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to ren@@ ew the current scene , click on the icon Ren@@ dering The symbol of Ren@@ ders in the tool@@ bar or select the menu @-@ entry view scene .
a R@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Pov@@ ray ; s ini @-@ files . it determines the image size and the quality of the ren@@ dering . if you want to insert a scene in different images sizes and quality levels , you can create any number of R@@ ender Mo@@ des from a fast preview of up to full quality .
if you click on the icon The R@@ ender settings in the tool@@ bar , or in the menu View of R@@ ender Mo@@ des ... , the following dialogue is opened :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but is a name that can detect the properties of the mode .
in the box card size you can enter the width and height of the calendar image . if you want just a small area of the image Ren@@ dering , select the cross @-@ section below and give the image to ren@@ dering into the entry fields .
in the Com@@ bin@@ ary field quality you can select the properties , the &amp; Pov@@ ray . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflection . a detailed description of the R@@ ender features can be found in the user Guide to &amp; Pov@@ ray .
if a picture is divided by only a beam per pixels . these images often have a mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or mar@@ ches effects in cur@@ ves and lines , sometimes details are not shown if they are smaller than a pixels . this effect is called Ali@@ er@@ asing .
&amp; Pov@@ ray : uses a technology called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these bugs . generally speaking images with this property is better off .
if you turn anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calculated and connects &amp; Pov@@ ray . more than a beam per pixels . this technique is called super @-@ sam@@ pling .
&amp; Pov@@ ray : supports two methods of the super sam@@ pling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the super @-@ sam@@ pling is adapted to the neighbouring Pix@@ els ; re@@ kur@@ si@@ vely , because each pixels is always divided again and adap@@ tive because the re@@ vocation of the de@@ ed colour evaluate .
if you choose the first method , followed POV @-@ Ray a beam pixels . if the difference between the color value indicates the neighboring pixels , then both pixels by the persecution of a specific additional number of pixels with super @-@ sam@@ pling will be charged , at a low level of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) added beams per pixels .
the difference between two pixel is calculated as : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixels , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixels . the difference is then :
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ B 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixels . if the difference between the color covers the pre@@ dat@@ ory thres@@ hold , then the pixels will be examined in 4 sub@@ sections , which are individually pursued and set out to further sub@@ missions . the maximum depth of records can be placed with the depths .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the production of smo@@ kers for the beam process , called J@@ atter@@ ing . if you dis@@ agree on , changed &amp; Pov@@ ray , the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for the quality of the ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use . this is a experim@@ ental property of &amp; Pov@@ ray , which is diff@@ use light re@@ flexi@@ on . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map , you can set whether the Alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixels is then transparent , if the related beams no property met .
opens a new window for the display of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ Con@@ sole Output . if &amp; Pov@@ ray ; un@@ expected , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ Sc@@ ene , select the menu entry file import@@ ing ... and select a file in the dialog box .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; not yet the complete powers of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; . if for import@@ ing error message or al@@ erts , a dialog displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; we want to import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ C@@ aw@@ End .
you can drag objects from the tree in the Editor to export the source code in the Editor text file . to import the source text file in the Editor . to import objects into the scene , select the source code in the editor and drag it to the tree tree .
with Copy and insert in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your editor you can add HTML @-@ text for &amp; Pov@@ ray .
the POV @-@ Ray @-@ command is called , if &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; a scene run . usually , this is Pov@@ ray or x @-@ Pov@@ ray .
if you click on help in the equity view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user document displayed . Set here the path to your documentation , and version 1 . support the versions 3.@@ 1g and 3.5 .
&amp; Pov@@ ray : search for external files ( for example cam@@ fel@@ dd@@ lers ) in the paths of the scene , you also need to enter the path to these files here . when a file comes into different paths of the library , the first fil@@ tered file will be used .
the colour for the wire models . the second color is used for the display of selected objects .
the colour for the control points . the second color is used for the display of selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the view of the camera view and in the window @-@ type identi@@ fier .
you can set the object of the points on the R@@ aster in the context menu of the wire model set . you can click here the grid separate for shi@@ fts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations .
larger values result in an accurate wire model and therefore a better se@@ wing for the requested objects , but require more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the detailed stage for two directions .
if you cross the High Detail@@ ue to extended proj@@ ections , all the wire model are further consolidated , when the camera is a extended projection . extended proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions to the perspective and sen@@ cre@@ atic proj@@ ections . this property gives a better approach to the proj@@ ections , but requires more time to ren@@ ew .
if you show wall a wall is divided into a wall behind the objects . the wall is shown in a chess board pattern of two con@@ stell@@ able colors .
if you show soil is performed a floor below the objects . the floor is shown in a ch@@ ecker @-@ board pattern of two con@@ stell@@ able colors .
if you activate cant@@ on , the non @-@ cur@@ sive Anti@@ ali@@ asing method for the ren@@ dering of the scenes . the values for depth and thres@@ hold can be set . more detailed information about parameters can be found in the section R@@ ender Mo@@ des .
on this page you can change your existing shut@@ ters or create new window @-@ regulations . in the section window , you can create shut@@ ters and save .
the Com@@ bin@@ ary standard tab : displays all the available shut@@ ters . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; uses the chosen window for the start of the program .
the list of existing shut@@ ters displays all existing shut@@ ters . a new arrangement allows you to create with the kno@@ b , and delete a selected arrangement with the kno@@ b .
each window assignment shall be identified by the name . the name must be clear and may not be empty .
the list under the name shows all the views for the chosen window rules . new views can create you with the kno@@ b Ad@@ ding and delete selected views with the kno@@ b Rem@@ ove .
the position of the new window . with new column you will create a new column on the right side of the available window , with card @-@ card you will receive a box view along with the previous view and flo@@ ating view , the view is not created in the main window , but creates a separate window .
you have just installed &amp; Pov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; and now you would like to start without more accurate knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but easy scene , under beginnings very popular : a ball on one level .
but you should carefully consider the following war@@ nings so that you get as a result only one black screen . if you use a 3D program , you should consider these important rules :
if you have no camera set , no rules for ren@@ dering them can be applied as a result you get a black picture .
if you do not include light sources , your whole scene lies in the dark and you only get a black picture .
if you have everything error @-@ free , take a look at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the following disclaimer :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the available symbols of the tool@@ bar . read the documentation , so that you can expect a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; start with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu entry . so you now have a scene without objects .
the wire model show shows how the camera looks all the scene that you create . especially , you notice the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the ren@@ der@@ ns of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if they click on it , see the content of the display properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user &apos;s document to &amp; Pov@@ ray , please find more details .
change anything to the basic settings of the camera , this is later instructions , but note that you can change the camera on the camera . simply click with the left mouse button on a box point and drag it to the desired place .
if you apply the button , or press the ab@@ et@@ aste , change the wire model and the tree immediately according to these settings . as a result they see here the scene from the view of the camera .
there are many possibilities to create the ground for the scene . you could include a qu@@ ader ( in@@ ser@@ ver@@ al body qu@@ ader ) and the size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but that is a cum@@ bers@@ ome method for solving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; offers actually a simple way . you can use an infinite plane as the ground :
a good advice : select the level in the tree @-@ tree , change the name and press the button . in the tree @-@ tree the new name is immediately displayed .
the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the wire &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; view now shows the level as well as at the moment only as limited European level . if you are the scene &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited European level , extends the level up to the horiz@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to view the object tree exactly , you will notice the default options for each new object : scal@@ y , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the properties tab .
in this scene , you should move the ground to exercise a unit among the sky@@ line , in order to get to know some of these parameters . select the shift and make values as follows :
choose the ground in order to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something different from the moment .
in both cases , a dialogue opens in which you can choose how the object is inserted . please select the item in the tree @-@ view ( name = floor Pig@@ ment ) , with one click on the button &quot; preview you see how the pig@@ s now looks .
of course shows the preview of the pig@@ ments only one Matt@@ es black material , because you can still need to check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview . you now give the colors for the pig@@ ment . also there are many possibilities , but do now take the easi@@ est .
if you see the preview of a color on qu@@ ader and ball , click on the button button and then call the preview .
the material for the ground now is right now . if your picture is now displayed with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course , this is not the color . you have expected to enter two new attributes . in the color list you need to do two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do this even more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board machine can only be used with two colors ) :
choose in the tree @-@ tree @-@ time and change the colors in the view of the properties :
this step you should already run it , since you should have understood the basic way of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the ball can be understood just as easy as the floor :
in the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings . put the value for the radius : on 1 ( forget not to apply the input to the ground . otherwise the ball would flo@@ at above the bottom , since you moved the ground to move down a unit down .
of course , the ren@@ dering now yield a strange result : how to see before , the ball @-@ surface appears as a Matt@@ es black material . put it in the following step an appropriate material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now specify a material . just like the floor , enter the ball a pig@@ ment as color :
choose Er@@ stes sub @-@ object and change the name for example in sphere Pig@@ ment . click on ball pigment , then select In@@ colored and put the values as follows :
but you can reach more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish properties :
change the values as shown in the following scre@@ enshots and click on or press Enter
the settings gl@@ oss effect and reflection are already partly good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med finishes , even though metal : not selected :
you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; hopefully you have already learned much so much that you can create a simple but beautiful scen@@ eries .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is an R@@ ender @-@ method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
if you have a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en , shooting the ren@@ derer hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the perspective of the spect@@ ator ( i.e. from the camera , who reflect the scenes effects of light sources in the scene and like atmosph@@ eric effects such as fo@@ g . thus , the scene is adapted for pixels .
as you can imagine , you will see without a camera , the camera is your eye , with which you see the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the picture is simple black . obviously , every scene is to be filled , some light sources and at least a camera .
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . Pov@@ ray files usually have the file expand@@ able * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in default file dialog you can select a file that you have previously made with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ;
always if you open a new model , the file will be inserted in this sub@@ menu and re@@ places the oldest entry in the list .
if you already saved the model , it is stored under the same name , it is a new file , you must enter a name and one disk .
introduces the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage will be rejected .
this menu entry can only be choosing if you do not yet stored any stored changes in the scene .
repe@@ ats the most recently re@@ vers@@ ed command . this menu entry can only be choosing if you have files .
saves the current window and opens up a dialog , in which you can enter a name for a new assignment or to write an existing assignment .
in this menu you will find options for setting up &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; , here you can change the look , the key@@ boards and the standard beh@@ ave .
opens up a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change with this option pre@@ view@@ le for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; prec@@ epts or New Add .
opens up a dialog to the setup of the tool@@ bar . you can add and remove with this option machine icons for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; -@@ commands and remove .
a dump map is a way to restrict consuming finishes without any b@@ ump on the surface individually mod@@ eling and without change without the geomet@@ rical form of the object itself .
it is common , the same file for a dump map as well as for a tex@@ ture map .
basic elements are simple geomet@@ ric shapes , which you can use as a building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from do@@ zen or even hundreds of this fundamental body . these models will then be dealt with to give them a realistic appearance .
a tex@@ ture map is a way to give the surface of an object colour to Pixel @-@ base , using a image file as a color card .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable image radi@@ ator and browser . the application has a file browser where you can select pictures to display .
images can either be represented in a separate window in the size of the image or in the full screen .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists the files that you can see with Click on &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the return return .
you can set whether each image should be displayed in a separate window or if all images always want to use the same window .
if you are looking for a certain file , it simply appears the first character of fil@@ ename in the browser window . then a small entrance field was found in the right corner . if a reasonable fil@@ ename is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field through gl@@ ut@@ ches of return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in dialog box - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five card cards . in three of them , general and editing and slideshow , you can set the working method of &amp; ku@@ n show ; in the two other , short commands for the display window and short typ@@ ing for the browser , the key@@ ring can be specified for the respective window .
if this is selected , then the images are not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the ad is filled with the wallpaper , which you can set forth below . default is not a full screen .
is this point activated , invites &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already the next picture in the folder , while you still watch the current picture . this reduces the delay when you choose the next picture and is particularly suitable for a slideshow .
with this option we store &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; when closing the name of the last opened folder . at the next start opens &amp; ku@@ n show ; this folder in the browser window will open .
click on the col@@ oured beams to select a background color . it is used to fill the background of the screen in the full screen mode . if in the window @-@ mode , the window is bigger than the picture , is also filled in the background with the selected color .
you can create &amp; ku@@ n show ; so that only some of the file types are displayed , which can display the program also .
this option is enlarged for large images the display window on the full screen . this option is swit@@ ched as default .
notes if the slideshow with the first image in the folder or with the selected image is to begin .
the time @-@ span between the image change in a slideshow . to change the value , you can use a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ ders , or the small arrows right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
the number of re@@ peti@@ tions . is this value to 0 , the slideshow is repeated until it is broken up by the user . to enter the value , you can use a new value into the input field or the small arrows right next to the input field . the default is 1 .
modify here the sc@@ anning range for the different modes of modes of &amp; ku@@ n show ; in the box short of the display window and short @-@ out for the browser .
with this option you turn off the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the part @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in one window

the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions which are mostly used in other KDE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions , player , playlist , playback browser and scripts . a appl@@ re@@ call for the D@@ CO@@ P function .
Amar@@ ok supports the command options of Q@@ t and &amp; KDE ; . additionally , Amar@@ ok has still some own command options .
you should give to the user a refund if the script can not be executed because of a missing depen@@ dency . please check in your script , whether all required modules are present and use k@@ dialog , so that the user does not exp@@ ire , why a script does not exp@@ ire .

in the folder you find Tem@@ plates you will find a lot of template @-@ scripts in many different languages . you can simply use it as the basis for your own scripts , or simply use the required functions . you will quickly find that the writing of scripts relatively easy .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P you can exchange your scripts data with Amar@@ ok and Amar@@ ok . the easi@@ est way is the use of the command d@@ co@@ p ; which each KDE should be installed .
most scripts do enable the trigger of external programs and commands . this is usually called ex@@ ec ( ) function . in this way it can be called d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively simple . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sending noti@@ fications to all current scripts . this is why scripts have to monitor their standard delivery and corresponding to events . of course , a script should also ignore the events even though it does not have any use for it .
configure the script to view the setup dialog . to store the storage and loading of the news data , each script itself must take care of each script itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok the labour folder on the folder , where all data should be saved .
tr@@ ack@@ change sign@@ alized that a new piece will be played . the script may now be used &amp; B ; with D@@ CO@@ P @-@ functions further information on the new piece ( for example the met@@ adata or the st@@ air length ) .

before &amp; Amar@@ ok has ended , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed for example , e.g. the memory of data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ oks script @-@ management can also install script packages , which can be compres@@ sed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ b@@ tender ) , which can also be compres@@ sed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ b@@ tender ) . we recommend a fil@@ ename such as e.@@ g ; B. means that the user can clearly see the archive clearly as Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the most far @-@ reaching amar@@ is@@ script . for this reason you should ren@@ ame your script packages .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining to lad@@ der modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the t@@ ar parameters -@@ p to get the file rights :
when your script is finished , you can upload it at www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and link to the Wi@@ ki scrip@@ ting page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; an@@ hang@@ ing . for your entry on KDE @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a audio player for &amp; KDE ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and still surprisingly simple to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music in the playlist instead of being through endless menu . perhaps you are looking for only a very specific title from thousand words in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos; s Coll@@ ector browser and the quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists but you can never decide which you want to listen ? then the play@@ lists browser is exactly the stra@@ ighten@@ ing for you . and if you choose the decision still difficult , choose the dynamic mode and the smart playlist automatically choose the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many gener@@ ative USB devices . besides , many different audio systems are used , such as you want to listen to your music .

play@@ lists : causes that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all fil@@ tered play@@ lists in your collectors folders ( .@@ pl@@ um and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection will appear then later in the play@@ lists browser .
the part collector database is used to choose a database for the collection . the Com@@ bin@@ ary field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ ql . if My@@ S@@ ql is selected still another dec@@ or in the sub@@ window of My@@ S@@ ql dec@@ or .
the section My@@ S@@ ql @-@ Set will be used to insert the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after calcul@@ ator : will the computer will enter into the My@@ S@@ ql databases in which the database is accessible via port : the network port . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use user name and password : to enter the data required for connection to the database .
the card @-@ card @-@ load @-@ load is the support for load @-@ load . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of don@@ ated poles to a load @-@ load server and when needed music recommendations regarding the current item .
here , enter your us@@ ername and password for your char@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you have no profile , you can register one on the load @-@ load website .
we send pieces and thus update the profile : this setting allows it &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the don@@ ated pieces to your work@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar interpre@@ ters are retri@@ ev@@ ing : upon activation of this setting will call &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list with similar interpre@@ ters to the each case . note : you can see the list in the context browser . note : you need no load @-@ free profile to use this feature .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; B ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of the functions and gallery with scre@@ enshots .
Amar@@ ok requires only the package of K@@ id@@ bs and otherwise no other KDE packages . you need to have K@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the included programs , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have a small guide on how to get K@@ id@@ bs minimal .
some features such as the O@@ SD are putting the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . G@@ NO@@ ME will work with such difficulties . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use K@@ id@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these are an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will make an error in the t@@ agli@@ b library . you can see the file at ~ / .@@ k@@ et / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ scan@@ .@@ log in . please report also the broken file that has caused the cr@@ ashing . afterwards , you can delete the file and create the collection again .
mostly it lies that t@@ agli@@ ding when reading the Met@@ a @-@ Infos from this file . please report this error to the t@@ agli@@ b developers in bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , then try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is something mature .
make sure that all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries were compiled with the same compiler version . if such as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with GCC 3.4 , t@@ agli@@ b but with GCC 3.@@ 3.@@ x compiled this leads to decline in the processing of met@@ a @-@ information .
if you use KDE using art@@ s@@ d then dis@@ abling automatic . off , if in@@ active for ... in the setting of the sound @-@ system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ ward by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail will automatically open up when a over@@ throw ) . if it is a common back@@ bone , and you will send us a good back@@ grounds , the error is guaranteed .
this is that there are many program data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 in the met@@ a @-@ Infos , but they do not know as Unic@@ ode . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; print &quot; errors in writing the tags from $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PAN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( assignment ) ren@@ dition / Dynamic playlist ) can be seen in KDE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes you can fix the status off on grey and semi @-@ transparent . notice that in some cases it must click on a symbol until that setting displays their effect .
if you get these errors : amar@@ is@@ app : symbol look@@ up Type : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ system Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pixels . this can be used with ld@@ d &apos;@@ at@@ amar@@ oc@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p Q@@ T .
to fix these bugs , you may remove any col@@ oured Q@@ t version or remove / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok is the right version first .
there are some possibilities . most installation problems show up with the help of an expert for your Uni@@ x@@ - or Linux distribution . you can also use the forum and the I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ de@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help to seek help . please enter there only one error if you are something like having a error in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; appears only one blank playlist : how to get tun@@ es there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of playlist .
to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the start@@ up window has been converted into the statistics window . you can find it under extr@@ as statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast FOR@@ W@@ ARD : stars stand for the rating through the user , while the points will be automatically calculated .
to evaluate pieces , needs to be displayed in the playlist and select column . click anywhere in the new application column , to specify the rating for a piece . you can also use the short notice Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ ok is located in the background .
select the files you want to remove , and press release on your keyboard . or click with right mouse button on your selection and then select a playlist from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and let them fall there exactly as you would do with other files . so simple is that : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , directly next to the Ad@@ ding button , just down the button playlist , click on it .
probably l@@ acks the program x@@ m@@ ms config . install the package x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . look after li@@ b@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ alis@@ ations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is within the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . besides , you will find it via the menu bar among extras .
no . yes , this is true ! not ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; use one of the back@@ end independent approach , hence , the real question are Wel@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ins / Arts / N@@ MM / MA@@ S / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we can support so pretty every only concei@@ vable audio format . G@@ stre@@ amer can even add text and PNG !
it may be ! perhaps you use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , giving it in the default no MP3 or comp@@ ress ( from pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : old @-@ F2 , GG : Red@@ Hat mp3 KDE , ab@@ et@@ aste
start the Ya@@ ST Online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s ab : - )
if you use the G@@ stre@@ amer driver with AL@@ SA files , the device must use a mix@@ er . a mix@@ er allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix -@@ module for AL@@ SA ( software @-@ mix@@ er ) . look at the help of the mix for AL@@ SA .
the output of this command should help you finding the problem @-@ matter and a solution . for G@@ stre@@ amer you may need to specify another S@@ ink ( such as oss@@ oms ) .
doing &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . do not forget that media must be de@@ co@@ ded at AL@@ SA . you can only get a white smoke . G@@ stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ co@@ ded and sends the PCM @-@ data to AL@@ SA . exactly like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ ko@@ ded the data first . G@@ stre@@ amer can give directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use the G@@ stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open the settings of Arts . open sound server with maximum possible priority ( real time pri@@ ffer ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ sw@@ rapper su@@ id is set :
with KDE 3.@@ 2.@@ X there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia Co@@ dec@@ s that can cause the disturbed playback . read this error report . the mag@@ nific@@ ant of the sound @-@ Pu@@ ff@@ ers in your AL@@ SA page file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either do not use the Arts driver but instead of G@@ stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install KDE @-@ Multimedia completely to obtain the quick@@ er Arts @-@ co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc . ) .
probably use the Arts driver . use a different driver ( the x@@ ine device driver has been optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts and Sound &amp; Multimedia , Sound System . the smaller of the buffer , the less applications respond to visu@@ alis@@ ations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us to fix it .
G@@ stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ stre@@ amer driver , stor@@ ms &amp; Amar@@ ok ; beginning . why ?
after installing G@@ stre@@ amer you need to register all components . execute G@@ ST register to register all G@@ stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ stre@@ amer FAQ . if this is not helps , you can also ask at the I@@ RC -@@ Channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( finish Amar@@ ok previously ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ pe@@ g download and install it . run the module folder of G@@ stre@@ amer all ff@@ m@@ pe@@ g files ( you can find the module folder with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run G@@ ST register once again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok .
please report about bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de.@@ be . if you have a complete list of suggestions / wishes , send it best to our mail@@ ing@@ list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very and find that the name sounds good sounds . besides , the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks D@@ CO@@ P it is already possible . put an alarm on your calendar program and let you run with the alarm on this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ o@@ player play play
this command leaves &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the playback . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you &apos;ll be inspired by the rolling k@@ illing of the music that you stopped in front of the bed .
how can I know the currently in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; ongoing title if you are on another computer ?
if a functional SSH environment is available , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you interpre@@ t and titles of the current item : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user mari@@ ju@@ user / Amar@@ ok players
replace IP address with your IP and your us@@ ername with your us@@ ername . this is pres@@ upp@@ oses that your identification in the file ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA is present .
the visu@@ alis@@ ations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a window will be separated from the keyboard and the current Analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size change@@ able window .
the combination of Str@@ g + right mouse button is one piece in the cli@@ ck@@ row rate into the qu@@ eue . through gl@@ ut@@ ches of the entrance s@@ ail , after a search in the playlist , the first search results will be played and set back .
OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ ck@@ rich functions , but how does it see with the icon in the system section of the control bar ?
click with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ s ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browser are to be displayed .
my personal folder $ HOME is located on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok , the Coll@@ ector database cannot be created and on the console are many trou@@ bles .
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok in a location drive , or use amar@@ o@@ K@@ s MySQL support .
place the CD , then click on the menu on Audio @-@ CD . it opens up a file browser with several folders . to add a few pieces and draw them in the desired destinations in a con@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic co@@ ding , you get instead of files from folders mp3 or og@@ g .

basically this doesn &apos;t fit the previous assessment with a decre@@ asing value , based on how often the piece was played . the more often has played the piece , the less influence has every single assessment of the total .
you can enter the evaluation for a piece by yourself by right click on a cle@@ av@@ ant button in the playlist window . then select the evaluation of one piece of it just like any other attributes , namely by selecting it or F2 . you can edit the evaluation also in dialog Met@@ adata .
the developers do not want to publish you when you want to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : KDE packages have a specified publishing plan of not with the short notice plan of Amar@@ ok .

if you want to use AL@@ SA , please select the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of bug@@ ging and therefore also causes a lot of error views .
pres@@ um@@ ably , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine these output modules are not compiled . you have to configure &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new configure and install .
now I have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules appear still not yet . and now ?
supp@@ os@@ edly use a distribution that installed the development files separated from the actual program . although G@@ stre@@ amer installed , missing the same goes for x@@ ine , you must install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . afterwards you must re@@ install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . afterwards you need to compile &amp; Amar@@ ok ; again new comp@@ iling and install .

if you want to search for entries , the space included , then close the search term with G@@ än@@ se@@ vice : Mike Old@@ field . this will be sought after entries the Mike Old@@ field , do not turn to entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a certain search column , you can also search for larger or less . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . this sear@@ ches for st@@ alls that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece , which does not contain a particular search term , make a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looking for mos@@ quit@@ oes , which is something not included .
you can combine these syn@@ taxes to co@@ aches with each other . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this is searching for all st@@ alls that includes either Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating as 50 and not the comment bad .
you can set the down@@ sides of entries by clicking the string button , and then click with the right mouse button in order to click on the entries . the entries will then be displayed with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces will be restored .
the tool@@ bar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of playlist . on the left you will find the button Add to add the playlist files . right next to you will find playlist , playlist and rand@@ om@@ ly mixing .
next follow the buttons , re@@ vers@@ ed and re@@ produce . with that you can make changes to the playlist , or restore .
in the middle of the tool@@ bar there is a unique , enlarged Analy@@ zer . the refres@@ hed rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer .
the last button in the tool@@ bar menu . it opens the same menu as that you can see in the player window via the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos; s configuration .
there are many more available buttons for the tool@@ bar , for example ren@@ ek@@ on@@ controls and Spe@@ aker . you can set the buttons buttons by clicking on the menu and select tool@@ bar .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of useful information available for playlist , the number of pieces and the total @-@ season of all pieces . in addition , the status for exp@@ iry and the playing time of the current item can be displayed . the status for random mode and repeat can be easily changed by clicking with the mouse double in the corresponding ad area .
you can also specify the status bar as well . please dis@@ able the option status bar in general settings .
the context menu can be reached by a click with the right mouse button in the player window or by clicking on menu . over this menu you can reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
a click on this entry opens the window of visu@@ alisation . there you can select the visu@@ alis@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
behind this entry there is a sub@@ menu with link@@ ages to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the Cover Administration is a useful ai@@ ds for managing your cover images . you can start it by selecting actions Cover in the collection browser .
the Cover Administration contains a list of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of a interpre@@ ters in your collection by selecting the interpre@@ t .
with the menu View you can choose what can be displayed in Cover Administration . choose from :
the qu@@ eue board received your large deposits in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this function you still have more control over the playlist , appears in the playlist won a number next to the title . this number represents the order , in the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will be played : 1 will first played , 2 as second , and so on .
the administration of the qu@@ eue will open you over extras qu@@ eue . if you want to add the qu@@ eue a piece , select the piece in the playlist , and then click + . you can also use the pieces in the playlist or use the context menu in the playlist , you can then change in the qu@@ eue management .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , which are already given two already ( the details about the establishment of this follow later ) .
fills your playlist with acci@@ dental mos@@ quit@@ oes from your entire collection and adds further random pieces .
adds pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m -@@ recommendations ( earlier : audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that already some pieces are in your playlist . you do not need any load profile for this dynamic playlist .
click twice on the desired playlist , drag them to the playlist window or click with the right mouse button on you and then select store . in this way , your current playlist should be replaced by the new one . you should save the old playlist so under circumstances ! with the
the two pres@@ et Mo@@ des rand@@ om@@ ly mix and play@@ lists instantly fill out your playlist and you may add to at least one piece themselves from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added at the next piece of piece , so your playlist will be filled only at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , then activate the latest possible dynamic mode : settings dynam@@ ical mode . this will use your existing playlist as a starting point . via the same menu entry the dynamic mode can be disabled again .
the kno@@ b New fill the current playlist and adds to the dynamic mode of new pieces . playlist , opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings .
with a right @-@ click on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to Edit on Edit . then the dialog displays the Edit menu of the playlist .
enter any name for the playlist : the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this attitude is not active , your playlist will grow continuously , the setting for upcoming pieces will be b@@ yp@@ ass@@ ed and they will be active in this playlist , but if the setting will be active , the setting will be split under consideration the setting tun@@ ed pieces .
well @-@ iel@@ ded pieces - this is the number of split pieces which should be preserved at the beginning of the playlist , so you can easily see which pieces recently played .
this is the number of pieces which should be added after each split piece to playlist . if you are here more than 1 set , the playlist will grow continuously because only one piece is played and removed .
the settings on the right side were already described in the previous section . on the left side of dialog , you can choose from existing ren@@ ists or smart playlist , will add &amp; Amar@@ ok ; random pieces from each of the attracted play@@ lists .
some scripts allow your own settings . you can customize the settings by clicking the script and then click on entry .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; scripts , install on the script . after installing the script , you will install a new entry in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . you can also use the kno@@ b more scripts .
if you do not want to use a script longer , you can delete it . select the script then click D@@ ein@@ stall .
if you are looking for information on writing your own scripts , please check in the section of writing scripts .
the dialog @-@ window Visu@@ alisation plug @-@ ins will be used to share the available visu@@ alis@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; use the window includes a list of all available plug @-@ ins . to use a plugin to activate a plugin besides the name .
this quick manual is to show you how to create with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps an audio CD . to complete the steps you must have a loud installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog box where you can choose which files you want to burn to CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD from MP3 or others , then remember that you can ren@@ ew to MP3 a worse , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD was created from a de@@ fun@@ eral format . use the project au@@ CD@@ t@@ ect .

c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . on the Internet , such programs are described in general as Ripper .
O@@ GG Sur@@ an Library : O@@ GG Sur@@ prise is an entirely open , pat@@ ent@@ less and professional technology on the audio co@@ ding and for the handling of audio data flow . O@@ GG pre@@ ference benefits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ GG pre@@ to Dec@@ oder@@ m and En@@ coder modules .
mad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ audio de@@ or . he currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported by the MP3 Decoder module .
l@@ ame : a far developed MP3 Decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial en@@ co@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 @-@ enco@@ der module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source code co@@ de@@ comp@@ ression and de@@ comp@@ ression . it is used by FLA@@ C @-@ Decoder module and the external audio @-@ enco@@ der module , so that you can read / C files .

V@@ CD@@ Im@@ ager : a fully @-@ equipped author@@ ised motor system to edit , dis@@ assembled and analy@@ sing video @-@ CDs and Super video @-@ CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool will be used to match the volume of music files on a standard stage . this can be useful for creating by gem@@ i@@ x@@ ten CD &apos;s and MP3 collections ; without norm@@ alize the different recording of different albums on the un@@ nice effect , which can vary according to music pieces differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : here is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to run from CD and automatically re@@ produce all videos in the base of the CD .
this is a convenient method , recently opened projects again . the associated sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project .
saves the current project . if the project has already been stored once , the previously used file will be over@@ written , otherwise it is asked for a new name .
saves the current project under a new fil@@ ename . KDE &apos;s dialogue can save under which you can choose folder and file name for the project file .
saves all active projects . this is the same as if you save a file for each individual project .
includes the current project . if a project changes and not yet been saved , asks &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what has to happen . you can then choose between stor@@ ing and changes . besides , you can also cancel the closing and keep the project so open .
closes all open projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for each non @-@ stored project , which should be done so as if you were called for each project file .
con@@ cl@@ udes all open projects and ended &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each non @-@ stored project will be asked what should be done so as if you were called the file .
if you have access this entry , you can select the same effect when selecting the files directly from the upper view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the add files in the basics of the CD .
opens the dialog &quot; burning &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button . the burning dialog can only be opened if the project has already been data .
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project @-@ type has different possible settings , most of which are described above what is the ? -@@ assistance ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video @-@ DVD project . it is useful when you are using files for a multi @-@ session CD . this is useful when this function is not used , even if this function is not used for you , so that you can see on the medium already existing files and folders .
this entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video @-@ DVD project . this function allows to remove &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and import@@ ed files from the current project . these function do not remove files from the medium , they bl@@ ends just the previously import@@ ed files .
opens the CD @-@ copying dialog . this enables you to create a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can also create an image from a CD , which you can then start playing later . besides , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of a normal cop@@ ier . you should have to copy sounds if you want to copy CDs with def@@ ective sectors or video CDs .
opens the DVD Copy dialog . this also allows you to create a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also get an image of a DVD with the help of the copying dialog . furthermore , there is also the target media large enough to record the entire ( video - ) data from source media in the original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . there@@ with , you can delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog to form@@ atting a DVD . with this dialog , you can form@@ atting a DVD ± R ( W ) which makes it completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you over@@ write the choice between the writing and incre@@ mentally .
bur@@ ns a previously er@@ ased CD @-@ image . the dialog asks for an * .@@ iso , * .c@@ ity or * .@@ to@@ c -@@ file as a data source code which can then be burned nor supported by pressing the burning button . ( N@@ eros * .@@ n@@ r@@ g -@@ files are currently not supported anymore , you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
bur@@ ns a previously er@@ digit DVD @-@ image . the dialog asks for a * .@@ iso -@@ file as a source of source , which then can be burned out by pressing the burning button .
a previously made DVD video can be converted . thereby , this dialog window will usually be used after reading a DVD in the ingre@@ dient , but can also be used as well . it contains information about the aus@@ age video , enco@@ ders and even ways to change the size and cut black bre@@ eds .
displays information about the installed media . this information is shown in the content view and contain properties of the medium , such as size and title @-@ length of the CD or DVD .
displays a list of tool@@ bar of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . if an entry is indicated , the tool@@ bar is visible in the main window .
if this is crossed , will display a small body at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed is the status bar release .
swit@@ ched the folder view , a summary of your folder and the CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , its content in the content view is displayed . CD / DVD drives have also a context menu with features such as media information , locks and un@@ lock the network or throw the medium .
swit@@ ched the content view a or out of . the content view enables to select and draw up files to the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video @-@ CDs , provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD in folder view .
swit@@ ched the header thing in the project view , which is only visible when the project view open projects includes . the Kop@@ fl@@ ste has no real function , it just looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views .
this opens a dialog window to the chang@@ ement of the keyboard Reg@@ ulations for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . after one of the available commands in the upper part , you can customize the ke@@ eper order for it further down .
this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; initi@@ ators . there@@ with , the correct justi@@ fications to Burn CDs and DVDs are required , so you must enter a password for system for@@ est@@ book ( root ) .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . here , general programme may be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should be working on angi@@ eb . this dialog is intended for person@@ alize and tuning the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is how many other &amp; KDE ; -@@ applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface also equipped with the help of this interface for example through a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; -@@ functions , you can either use the Command program d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are decisive in function , therefore , more of your taste and the way of your task is decisive , which the mandatory programs you provide .
in this chapter we will use that you can use the Command program d@@ co@@ p . to make use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; -@@ functions you need to ensure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter a bit like the following in the console :
apart from the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; -@@ functions , all &amp; KDE ; -@@ Program painted , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts , which are described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions as cop@@ y@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other functions to create new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ re@@ cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ Object ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ re@@ cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ Object ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ re@@ f ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ re@@ f ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ re@@ f ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ re@@ f ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ re@@ f ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ re@@ f ( ) : void Bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( kur@@ l ur@@ l ) void Bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( cur@@ l ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you can create a D@@ CO@@ P @-@ reference ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project by using d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project in accordance with this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface , which is only applicable on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ string set ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( cur@@ l : : List URLs , Q@@ String ( Q@@ string path ) void set@@ ame@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string new@@ name ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ string id )
with this , it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folder and then adds files to the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ co@@ p ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT P@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT P@@ co@@ p / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ t@@ xt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ tors ; is a audio CD ; -@@ reader for &amp; KDE ; . with it you can easily read audio CD ; s can be read and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible depending on the enco@@ der of the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ ted ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for the reading of &amp; CD ; -@@ data in WAV files on the hard disk ) and of many co@@ di@@ ers who have to be installed ( compres@@ sing free comp@@ ression ) . further co@@ di@@ ers can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the titles of the &amp; CD is read and stored in WAV files on the machine ( los@@ ed and compres@@ sed ) ; and then
are usually one per title to compres@@ sed these WAV files ( usually one per title ) compres@@ sed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or other formats like the ver@@ funny FLA@@ C .
for the first step , to read the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ tors ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost any distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this has to be done now .
for the second step l@@ ame ( for O@@ GG ) or other codes needed . all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distri@@ butions available . however , only the co@@ di@@ erer is needed to be installed . if , for example FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is also not required .
which co@@ di@@ ers / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to Ko@@ di@@ erer , audio quality and compres@@ sed factors .
a word regarding the copying of protected audio CD ; s : as previously said , &amp; k@@ audi@@ tors ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read it . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; it is not possible to avoid any protected audio CD ; even if not the mechanisms of cop@@ per@@ taining ; even if not the mechanisms of cop@@ per@@ taining to it . avoid simply the purchase of Cop@@ ier audio CD ; s !
while working only has to be done ( the setup dialog can be done so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , following the daily handling of a &amp; CD ; on the hard disk drive . this leads ( hopefully ) to understanding the slim approach of the user interface , about which you are often asked at the beginning .
can convert to many formats - depending on which co@@ di@@ ers programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can be &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB from the Internet or can work completely without network , whereby everything is recorded manually .
this is only a short list of commands of the main page . on the page step by step example will find out more information on how this program is used as well as scre@@ enshots from descriptions of the tab for the configuration of the program .
starts the CD@@ DB request of the CD @-@ Data according to the setup of request in the Audio DB card ( this can be locally or online in the latter case , the connection has to be connected to the Internet . )
starts reading and - when an En@@ coder has been configured in the tab , enco@@ ding , - the co@@ ding .
opens up a sub@@ menu with a list of available En@@ coder , allowing the selection to be read by another En@@ coder as the default file . it is to be noted that the En@@ coder has been configured in the tab .
opens the file manager , so that an already selected file will be selected instead of a full &amp; CD .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as prot@@ oc@@ ols , pi@@ ep@@ ers ) for exempl@@ ars ( such as read the &amp; CD ; termin@@ ated ) .
opens the main news dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ tors ; with various card cards ( like En@@ coder , to set up the En@@ co@@ ders ) . hi@@ erh@@ in need to go before the program can be successful !
this chapter describes tape quality , co@@ di@@ ers and comp@@ ression rates and helps you in choosing the right Ko@@ di@@ fier .
if no audio @-@ information should be lost , will be a fun @-@ free audio format . besides FLA@@ C there are also other like &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; A@@ &apos; , which may possibly be available for this distribution . the draw@@ backs are the small compress@@ or advise and hardly available commercial devices that can be reco@@ vered these files .
among the audio forms , the information provided by means of compres@@ sed concrete model , are MP3 and O@@ GG . O@@ GG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in der audio quality at lower bit@@ ing ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but about this bit@@ rate the differences will produce less important , since both co@@ di@@ ers produce very good audio quality .
o &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is provided free with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions
+ high to very high quality ( with high bit@@ umen ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly deeper quality in deeper bit@@ ing .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard by a computer or a computer @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG .
MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car @-@ stereo systems . today - at first 2009 - support these devices often only the MP3 format .
a brief list of parameters to audio @-@ quality and resulting from the comp@@ ression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for other parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting results good transparency for most people and most of the most people
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting usually offer for most people and most tun@@ es acceptable transparency , and has already quite high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps v@@ BR , comp@@ ression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo system with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ B 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , comp@@ ression rate about 5.5 . needs more 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need CB@@ R@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR joint stereo , comp@@ ression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . well Just for music of young people , portable devices and Aut@@ ost@@ ere@@ o@@ anlagen . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be ex@@ agger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you definitely want the highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that can be installed manually or by the program automatically from the free@@ DB over the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can be given / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ tors ; and the co@@ di@@ er@@ ator program around the folder and file name as well as the characteristics of the music files .
in connection with enco@@ ding programmes , there is often a combination of program , for the co@@ di@@ erer and these parameters , here . the manual or help of the co@@ di@@ ers declare the switch to these programs .
e.g. to add the &amp; CD ; titles to the sam@@ pling ( English : day ) when MP@@ 3@@ s can be added with l@@ ame , the switches of l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ tors ; the result looks so out : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ ences ; parameters that can be used ( = Kn@@ op@@ f@@ b@@ ording in assist@@ ants ) :
that &apos;s what the free@@ DB is : a free database , in which persons can download the audio CD , so all others can download the information instead of yourself in the machine : &amp; CD ; titles , artist , names of pieces &amp; etc ; , not by the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( at m of the U@@ eb@@ ers@@ etz@@ ers : so that the author is meant to be no law@@ yer . however , no one may refuse that you are on the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so you can neither get damage to the artist &apos;s music ; more or less worth@@ less , so you can neither get damage to music nor CD ; business , physically or virtu@@ ally .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ tors ; is active a proposal to select ( submit an address ) . for the use of free@@ DB may not be used with another ( coun@@ terf@@ eit ) . in this type of configuration , it does not appear , the e @-@ mail address given by the server does not use ( This can only know the programmer which has checked the code . )
there are in many countries copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ spread ; for the use of free@@ DB is to be used , the geographic on the next underlying mirror @-@ server will be used . this saves band@@ width on the network and is like the load between the b@@ ills .
a visit at fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org delivers a recent list of mir@@ r@@ ors for the online call of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually issued monthly ) just the updates to the database .
what output program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there is rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who want to know exactly what it is exactly what I want to read right on source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; it &apos;s always necessary to install the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the right distribution first has to be installed if this has not yet happen .
to save the stored WAV files the co@@ di@@ erer and therefore the desired file format will be chosen for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ G@@ s ) and FLA@@ C ( O@@ G@@ G@@ s ) and FLA@@ C ( O@@ G@@ G@@ s ) and FLA@@ C ( O@@ G@@ G@@ s ) and FLA@@ C ( O@@ G@@ G@@ s ) and FLA@@ C ( O@@ G@@ G@@ s ) and FLA@@ C ( O@@ G@@ G@@ s ) and FLA@@ C ( O@@ G@@ G@@ s ) and FLA@@ C ( O@@ G@@ G@@ s ) and FLA@@ C ( O@@ G@@ G@@ s ) and FLA@@ C ( O@@ G@@ G@@ s ) and FLA@@ C ( O@@ G@@ G@@ s ) and FLA@@ C ( O@@ G@@ G@@ s ) and FLA@@ C ( O@@ G@@ G@@ s ) and FLA@@ C ( O@@ G@@ G@@ s ) and FLA@@ C ( O@@ G@@ G@@ s ) and FLA@@ C ( O@@ G@@ G@@ s ) and FLA@@ C ( O@@ G@@ G@@ s ) and FLA@@ C ( O@@ G@@ G@@ s ) and FLA@@ C ( O@@ G@@ G@@ s ) and FLA@@ C ( O@@ G@@ G@@ s ) and FLA@@ C ( O@@ G@@ G@@ s ) and FLA@@ C ( O@@ G@@ G@@ s ) and FLA@@ C ( O@@ G@@ G@@ s ) and FLA@@ C ( O@@ G@@ G@@ s ) and FLA@@ C ( O@@ G@@ G@@ s ) and FLA@@ C ( O@@ G@@ G@@ s ) and FLA@@ C ( O@@ G@@ G@@ s ) and FLA@@
the coalition package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the cook@@ ers may be used . this is also required for pre@@ defined co@@ di@@ erer . more information about co@@ di@@ ers are in chapter Wel@@ ch Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a co@@ di@@ der , more information about his switch can be obtained through the input of a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a con@@ sol@@ ete window ( eg ; con@@ sole ) . there must be &apos; l@@ ame &apos; replaced by the name of the installed body .
this can have many causes . check the setup of the Device @-@ drawing of &amp; CD ; / DVD disc , the desk and readers are installed by both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia as well as the audio @-@ co@@ di@@ erer of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) . try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal block . this could give a note that is wrong .
check if you do not want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the she@@ ath of &amp; CD ; . this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips as you have to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , all understood , but somehow still uns@@ ure what to do is ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by step example , and you will get enough information to adjust to those fields that the program is exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time and read our first &amp; CD . we will use l@@ ame &apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; use MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 stit@@ ch ( tags ) .
you need to be installed on your computer . both programs should be installed as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found as not completely free software , as it is not necessary to compile the source files , which of course you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is and that you have imag@@ ined it ( eg ; by trying to copy with the quer@@ or to copy ) .
the first section covers the basic set of &amp; audi@@ ences ; and something which probably needs to be done only once and
the second section describes the procedure to read one &amp; CD ; what can be repeated for each exp@@ ul@@ ing &amp; CD ;
here we determine the comp@@ ression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . since we are la@@ zy , we share the program with the free@@ DB to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not edit them on any event of a &amp; CD , if once the appropriate settings are found .
the device recording is handed over to the reader program so that it can read &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces can read .
often / dev / c@@ drom a symbo@@ lic link to the real Device drawing of your drive . if this is not working or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD player can be specified , so helps a look into the file / etc / f@@ st@@ ab and an attempt to use the existing entries of the equipment records for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the card map General settings . here gi@@ ts not much to do . here , an additional conversion will be defined . in our example everything will be shown as shown as shown in the scre@@ enshot .
only when un@@ complete information may choose , so you will be informed when information about the testi@@ moni@@ als of keywords ( tags ) are missing .
the card map CD ; -@@ settings . just select both entries . we are comfortable and allow the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a free@@ DB computer .
note : the calcul@@ ator must be connected to the computer &amp; CD ; to access the Internet , so that he can access the free@@ DB server .
the second selection field is easier , a &amp; CD entry is easy , will immediately start reading the &amp; CD ; . this is easily changed by the database entry and the name of the directory name / fil@@ ename or day entries , they can easily changed . the directory entry and the ID@@ 3 @-@ tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; KDE ; tag@@ ger .
aside from this example it is further to note : if you want to manually enter it . however , these over 620 MB large , consider this to use the database before . however , this is worth 620 MB large , at least the first one . the mode is set on the following map map .
CD@@ DB is for us free@@ DB . these are settings for your details on request , for calling the &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB server via the Internet . how does the system to get the CD ? read the section about free@@ DB . put everything as shown in the scre@@ enshot .
mode : we have not downloaded the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
the CD@@ DB server : please go to page fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and have a look after a mirror server in your area . on this road the burden will be distributed among the invo@@ ices . this setting will be used as first attempt .
both are functioning what the server affects , as many fire@@ walls the protocol 88@@ 80 st@@ ard@@ ly bo@@ iling , there is perhaps more luck with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to surf the internet .
in this example we do not want to submit &amp; CD ; data to the free@@ DB server . the first an@@ arch@@ ist field should be dis@@ able .
simply take over the settings from the scre@@ enshot . ( make sure the folder / t@@ mp on your computer exists )
number of simultaneously co@@ inci@@ ding pieces : sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the same time occur at only an existing drive ? Parall@@ el@@ es reading and co@@ ding ? the author does not know it , therefore simply try .
CD ; after reading the last piece : cross out this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you do not have to be saved the path / folder , in which the WAV files is stored , the box is not created in the private folder . forget the files in the private folder . forget this folder if you want to make something with the WAV files .
all such as it is displayed on the scre@@ enshot . the command is somewhat long , under circumstances must be caused slightly to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned before , it is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good Hi@@ Fi stereo systems . it reached the average of about 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the reached comp@@ ression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and storage .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the restriction of the generation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1 . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; KDE ; in case of a later modification of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input ( including the full path ) and the output path ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as shown in the scre@@ enshot . some comments for future use outside of this appl@@ ause :
number of simultaneously to co@@ di@@ ating WAV files : with a du@@ core or Quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to co@@ ding more than a WAV file at the same time .
this is it , we have just finished the basic set of &amp; k@@ audi@@ ences ; termin@@ ated this configuration is used as standard for each out@@ read of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organisational structure of your music you need to change it again .
in this section describes how the process of the read@@ able of the &amp; CD is described . we will set MP3 files . the folder structure is designed and set up a connection to the Internet , since we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the free@@ DB will need to be described in this section , must be repeated for any trigger &amp; CD .
since we use a &amp; CD , which is still not included in free@@ DB , see the scre@@ enshots from a little different than that for a &amp; CD ; with successfully from free@@ DB data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually to pick up , instead of them from the Internet . comments are to point out on the differences .
do not try the &amp; CD ; this appl@@ ause to find . it is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this hand@@ book .
if this is not done yet , now the &amp; CD has to be defined in the drive , which was defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and its length should be listed in the window , as shown in the scre@@ enshot . this only when the &amp; CD was identified as audio CD ; and could be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen , then search in the section questions and answers following the help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD could be picked up successfully by the free@@ DB , all titles of the pieces are already filled and also the name of the artist and album are indicated .
for the event that there is more than an entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; CD ; there is a window built inside and you can select the database entry that your opinion is best to your &amp; CD .
if you do not have the cross @-@ crossing of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; -@@ settings in dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually end manually by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you have no local database , but the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - input of the CD @-@ Data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next scre@@ enshot . the title of the piece in the first line of the &apos; update title &apos; , the rest of the data in the entry field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist must no longer be given in the entry field &apos; latest title &apos; unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments of ini@@ ell per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that are common to all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful call of the data from the free@@ DB is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD Edi@@ tors ( such as if all words are satisfied with big letter or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any undes@@ irable comments .
note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ tags . this is limited the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artists , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comm@@ ent@@ aries . if you have ID@@ 3@@ v2 . if you set up ID@@ 3@@ v2 . if you set up ID@@ 3@@ v2 . if you set up ID@@ 3@@ v2 . this option is set up on the tab plane ; take a look at the section &apos; basic settings &apos; .
you can change the day @-@ information of the generated files later with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files with him , you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 .
tags will not support from all Ko@@ di@@ ers or file formats . see you in the help to Ko@@ di@@ erer to get more information .
simply select an entry that is obviously wrong with the style of the trigger CD ; this example is not important , since we do not transfer the &amp; CD . for more information go to the Internet page of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap for example are to be found under rock .
after the election of &apos; OK &apos; come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD @-@ Edi@@ tors appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the given data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current item . the title of the item in any case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed to the same way to you all the titles data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB . it is already s@@ orted in one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . please note that the artist and the album above the St@@ ü@@ ckl@@ list are displayed .
note that there has been a check @-@ sign in front of each line of a piece . only the titles which are highlighted above . a simple click on the line are selected , or you put the button all pieces select at the bottom of the screen to choose all pieces at once .
was started by clicking on the button &apos;s selection , so this window will appear in confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on .
click on the tab orders to switch on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is not read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status row .
this error message can be seen if you are trying to work with a body that you have not yet installed . pieces which are not successfully tested with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for t@@ mp file and the destination folder are not what we have given here in sample . have you checked whether you write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is clear why the error has occurred directly after the end of the first piece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the mission 1 reads the first piece of it , it is finished . but we have a new entry : mission 4 is the co@@ ding of piece 1 to the format MP3 . to take place automatically and co@@ ding in parallel . see the status of the status in the bottom of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration settings to supp@@ ose this behavior . the only thing is configur@@ able to read and co@@ ding . when weak machines is the result un@@ clear . the used calcul@@ ator with a am@@ d@@ 64 does not seem to have a problem at simultaneous functions and co@@ ding ( of however two different pieces ) .
now the last title will be read , while another piece is co@@ ded and a third order in the qu@@ eue of the Ko@@ di@@ der . after the last piece is co@@ ded , a small window will be built with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ tors ; you need &amp; KDE ; 3.@@ x. or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compres@@ sed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the co@@ di@@ erer of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ ted ; is now talking within the &amp; KDE ; CV@@ S as part of the col@@ oured media package , however , you can download from there an anonymous copy . most distri@@ butions available . most distri@@ butions from your distribution . if you &apos;re reading this , you have probably done it ...
this section is addressed to people that compile the source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help like the program can be adjusted when it runs it once , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls for many different programs , has many variants of attitudes . most read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it displays scre@@ enshots of the various boxes of settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , still am reading ? even if only the help of the program was cli@@ cked on it , without any cl@@ ue way it is to go from this kind of empty screen ( especially if at the time of the program Do not exist no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it ? who this reads , probably already started the program . it should be something like that :
a real example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author can not maintain this manual . it &apos;s as the first version for a manual , or change it . at least only after the contact with the author . and if you read this , he saved this section and therefore agree with this suggestion .
strange when you have succeeded in order to get the source file from &amp; KDE ; SV@@ N then you do not need this information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; KDE ; . besides others he has not yet have some properties , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI Player did not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system based on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; KDE ; -@@ support . &amp; k@@ mid ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound project driver , which is required for the CIS . AL@@ SA is supported as soon as it is a sequence .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphic representation of the activity each MIDI channel by pressing keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
Dra@@ g &amp; Drop is that you can draw in &amp; KDE ; any MIDI file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; display window on the Mid set .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( voltage requirements or text files ) .
seat suppor@@ tive . if you finish &amp; KDE ; during the playing of a song , the Mid start the next time starts with the same song again .
supports external MIDI @-@ syn@@ thesi@@ zer , AW@@ E , FM and GUS cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select Op@@ ening ... from the menu File . it appears the usual file dialog with which help you can select the desired song .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window in the &amp; k@@ mid ; window will drop . this also works with multiple songs simultaneously .
to play a piece of music , open it and pra@@ ying the kno@@ b drop in the tool@@ bar , choose the entry out of the menu piece of or dec@@ ou@@ ve the le@@ ak@@ ar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts as soon as you move it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window windows . ( with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then re@@ played out to each other . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece plays , you can jump on any point by using the middle mouse button and drive to the rain .
if you find that a song is too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows left and right of Tem@@ po@@ display and so the playing speed . to be back the original speed , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ ds LCD .
the Le@@ ert@@ aste has two tasks : when a piece is ab@@ played , a pressure on the button &apos;s break or selecting the menu entry into the menu , thus breaks the playback . you do not play the Le@@ af@@ ar during no piece , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; the reproduction .
lyrics can be saved on two ways in a piece of music . some pieces are used tex@@ tiles , others using Li@@ ed@@ tex@@ tiles and again other both . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set what events are supposed to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically selected , so you have to set nothing manual . if so in the menu setting the entry automatic editor , you will always have the opportunity to change it if you want to see the other way .
if you want to set up an event type , select from the menu Sett@@ ings , select the entries of text files or incl@@ u@@ ties . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you summar@@ ize . these are displayed in line . in this section , how you can use collections effectively .
to create a collection , open first the collector manager . this will be shown in the menu collection under the point .... Click there to New and give the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then select the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original .
if you have more than a collection , you can adjust the coll@@ ects in the Coll@@ ective manager .
into the temporary collection all the songs that you want to add no other collection .
when leaving the application this collection will not be saved . concerns the when you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , she needs to be selected at the collector manager . there you can add one song with the button . it appears in turn the file dialog with which help you can select the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on the setting automatic shut@@ down to the collection .
if Automatic Ad@@ ding to the collection is enabled a piece when opening ( using file opening or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) automatically added to the active collection .
when Automatic to the collection is not activated , when opening a piece of a piece the temporary collection will be activated and pun@@ ched . this collection will then be added .
to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collector manager to select the collection and the desired song and then click on Rem@@ ove .
you can select the order in which the songs will be played . if you choose the row from the sub@@ menu check out the menu collections , the songs are played in order , as they were added to the collection .
if you add songs or remove or remove any order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , choose it in the Coll@@ ective manager , or use the output list via the kar@@ a@@ oke text .
to jump a song to jump , select the button neighbour@@ ly song , the entry next song from the menu or press the arrow to the right .
to jump a song back to jump , select the button @-@ out piece , the entry previous piece of the menu or press the arrow left .
to delete a collection , open the collector manager , select the del@@ ights collection and click on the button @-@ del@@ e@@ tion .
the temporary collection can not be deleted . however , this does not matter , as it is not saved in leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not saved .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesi@@ zer that are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case the MIDI map General @-@ MIDI @-@ MIDI events in events that understands the syn@@ thesi@@ zer .
for example you can create a MIDI map , all events of the type Change patch to Br@@ ight Piano in events of the type Change patch to Tr@@ umpet , and thus always a trumpet , if originally a piano should play .
if you have only one sound card , you do not need any MIDI map , because all Sound@@ cards are GM -@@ compatible ( incl . AW@@ E - and GUS -@@ cards , FM radio devices and so on ) .
unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps , so you need to edit the appropriate file from hand ( with your favourite ) .
a MIDI map is a text @-@ file that stores all required fields to play a piece .
each section may only appear , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which may appear as often as desired . prerequisite for this is however , that every appearance has a different text ( see below ) .
defic@@ its PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; A further key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ ANNE@@ L@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D options ... EN@@ D
you see that Def@@ ine is needed to view that a section begins ( except for options ) and EN@@ D , that the end of an evening is achieved .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible .
in this section the pat@@ ches of General MIDI to your specific keyboard are shown as follows :
please note that the left side of the sign label will be ignored . it is assumed that the GM pat@@ ches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the op@@ tion@@ ale All@@ key@@ s@@ To M is needed to put this instrument on the tone with the number M . if your keyboard does not support you ( GM @-@ patch 127 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to the PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section .
so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a touch with Patch 127 ( Win ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term drum patch the patch represents , where every sound is a different Per@@ kus@@ sion@@ instrument ( Tro@@ mmel , bas@@ ins , Mar@@ acas &amp; etc ; ) and not the one who possess the tone of the ton@@ height of the always the same drum ( like him ) some key@@ boards ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is used to specify as tones on a specific channel or instrument . use is :
as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the order of the lines is very important , as well as their presence . you need to create 128 entries .
you can define multiple key@@ boards for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use different names on the first line .
key@@ boards are used mainly to check out tones on the per@@ t @-@ channel @-@ channel . look at as an example the provided key@@ boards .
this section may be used to convert some channels to others . if you want to spend the first and second channel , make it quite simply in CH@@ ANNE@@ L@@ MA@@ P section .
however , these settings are usable for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a particular channel ( General MIDI to Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
Midi @-@ devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ ANNE@@ L@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , num@@ bered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following patterns :
N is the channel shown on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the key@@ map will need to be defined in the file . if you need to change the For@@ ce@@ patch option , all the events are ignored . in this case the patch will be used in this channel . in this case the patch will always be used .
the option For@@ ce@@ patch can be useful for example to use the Per@@ k@@ egel patch on the per@@ ky @-@ site .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ ben@@ der@@ ratio is to be multiplied in which ratio Pit@@ ch @-@ ben@@ der @-@ event will be multiplied by the value n , this with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) is expected , and then transmitted accordingly . the value of 40@@ 96 will be used in the map file .
this setting will be used because GM indicates that a keyboard , which should play a Pit@@ ch @-@ ben@@ der event with the value of 40@@ 96 , a tone higher to play . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards up to one oc@@ t@@ ave higher to play . to try the right value on your keyboard , you must try a bit of &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , open the dialog MIDI settings . this can be found in the menu under settings , point MIDI settings
the se@@ al@@ view is a window with a whole row Kla@@ vi@@ atures ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these piano , you can see which sounds are being played .
you can also use the rab@@ bit view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a instrument , illumin@@ ated the kno@@ b not more green but red , to view that no more the original instrument is used .
the se@@ al@@ view has ( until now ) two different views to view the don@@ ated tones . the view select menu under the point of the se@@ al@@ view : settings
the pace LCD shows the speed display , with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . if you find e.g. , a song be too fast to follow the text , you can slow it . to change the pace , use the arrows left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece must be played . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , &amp; etc ; . with this one can perform the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way .
well , I can use any@@ body to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs around 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file will need a similar sound quality . in a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc ; you have control of everything .
this can happen if you have a bin@@ ary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; have happened because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support was compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to install an source distribution and install ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos; s Home )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually .
agree to support &amp; k@@ mid ; Dra@@ g &amp; Drop . open the folder you want to add in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
activate before default the setting automatically add to the collection . otherwise the files to the temporary collection will be added .
you can click the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD , to restore the reproduction . in order to restore the stand@@ point you can click on the LCD double room .
I have played on one &amp; KDE ; -@@ Working area a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; in this way I need to play a MIDI file or I want to play a file , only into the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; display window and the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ;
if you want to listen to a file without having to add a file without them to a collection , turn the setting automatically added to the collection , and the new ; file will add to the temporary collection .
take off you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. sugars just want to play the first file . so you set the setting automatic shut@@ down to the collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection then contains exactly this a MIDI file .
then , close yourself to create B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid , and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . all the warm thank you ! if I hear this songs or see the postcard , anim@@ ates me that , further to &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; at the moment I &apos;m in the third year , so I try to take a lot of spare time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a bit of time . as Hob@@ bies I collect programming , MIDI files , music make and phr@@ ases .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ a@@ oke files if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an e @-@ mail : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is.@@ it
you really make me a huge fre@@ ude if you send me a postcard from your residence or a MI@@ DI@@ - / Kar@@ a@@ oke file from a local group . once you want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file , you should contact me by friends by &amp; k@@ mid ; but you should get in touch with me , as I might have the file already .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my free time and I don &apos;t want to get money for that money . I would like to empha@@ size that I am only further program@@ m@@ able because / when I come back feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ w@@ ai and Joseph H. B@@ ühler - Beh@@ avi@@ ation of the Miss , that the Ton@@ height at AW@@ E @-@ cards was too high .

and of course , my thanks also applies to all these great musicians on the net , who give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ oke files .
in addition to this can be found &amp; k@@ mid ; also on his homepage can be found under http : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is.@@ it / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ del@@ i . on the homepage you can look at the development , information and look at links to sites with other car@@ a@@ oke songs , &amp; etc .
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound@@ card or an external syn@@ thesi@@ zer , since the sound quality depends much on your sound@@ card . it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an AW@@ E card .
if you do not have any sound card , you must compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameters MO@@ DE _ demo _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL , except if you could have a sound card , except that of course you cannot listen to music .
if any problem occur , please contact one of the &amp; KDE ; -@@ mail@@ ing@@ lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ player , Ph@@ ono and FF@@ M@@ pe@@ g . the program is needed to play video files from the Player or ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as for the reproduction of DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ Name ; was not yet finished as &amp; KDE released on this computer .
for additional help , to check the KDE website on new versions or send the question to The &amp; KDE ; user mail@@ ing list .
the application window is formed from so called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the playlist . and finally there is a information window , which is only displayed when information is re@@ mit .
it is possible to pick up links below the book@@ marks , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries , which should be played to each other , so you should use the category permanent playlist .
of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional Hier@@ archy . if you copy an entry to the current category and the reproduction begins with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; latest piece &apos; , television and permanent playlist can also be changed by direct editing of XML configuration files . of course , one can only do when &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; but also through the application itself . simply click on a name of a category cli@@ cked , click on the menu view and next to the next mach@@ ining of a sub@@ group only the XML content of this part is shown .
after changing XML files , needs to be selected from the menu with playlist , and either selected the mach@@ ining mode , or another category are selected .
all changes will be lost when the processing mode leave or another group is selected without the playlist .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some functions can only be swit@@ ched on through the changing of the XML configuration files .
the animation during the species and termin@@ ate can be disabled by the editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and changing from &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above . if the option is not available , it can be easily added .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; the files will be ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .@@ xml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during the La@@ unch does not need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening a different source . this would be distur@@ bing the user , however , the user can therefore end the application a second time .
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the ads of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; img _ h = &quot; in@@ dy@@ lining ; &amp; lt : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f ; &amp; lt ; / bo@@ dy@@ gt ; &amp; lt : / bo@@ dy@@ gt ; &amp; lt : / bo@@ dy@@ gt ; and in directory tests / some examples of S@@ MIL the by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; are supported .
there is a rider for configuration of M@@ player in the configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . here , the path of the M@@ Player and the intermediate space can be set out of the network and other things .
another tool for de@@ bug@@ ging is the kno@@ b &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output from m@@ player .
there is no tab for this playlist dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . everything must be configured by manual processing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ ing@@ c . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; using the module @-@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa :
&apos; Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be added to the specific box Embed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
with that the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages may be re @-@ player , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as a service provider for the MI@@ ME type Application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog .
the con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is in a con@@ sol@@ ation application and search for error message concerning the charging of the browser module library . if any errors occur is the back@@ end issue inside &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu to review ) .
so always a given back@@ end for a certain MI@@ ME type is taken ( of course only if this has been chosen ) , this must be done by manual chang@@ els of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , ph@@ on@@ on all og@@ g files will be reco@@ vered :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can be installed from TV cards , either via M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this need k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV , you need to be configured to use @-@ to @-@ use device and the TV channels . this can be used manually from the configuration file or the configuration file can be converted manually .
to the configur@@ ate of the V@@ DR ( video data rec@@ orders ) settings in the m@@ m@@ player &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port to use . there you should be selected by which one is selected . the correct code has to be found ( e.g. is PAL on West Europa ) , the correct name is probably one DV@@ B in it .
since the V@@ DR support from k@@ m@@ player only X@@ Video can also work ( pres@@ um@@ ably this type of playing video devices under Linux the only works ) . this is why the vide@@ o@@ for@@ l@@ inux extension to the X Server functions must therefore be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig )
intern@@ ally are used by KM@@ Player for the sources different names . at the time of the formation of this documentation is this dv@@ d@@ ull source , source @-@ source , exotic source , source @-@ source and v@@ m@@ source . when they are enabled , they begin with the playback of the playlist .
are there notice how I can make my CD@@ ROM drive , if I play of him ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is as user root according to the device &apos;s device . it is absolutely secure to ensure that / dev / c@@ drom on the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine starts slow on how every time my CPU has to be tested on their performance ?
note : the answer is over@@ hau@@ t. k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last stored value , only the first time it will examine the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical desktop areas and network support and is required for the ili@@ ili@@ ation of &amp; k@@ ile ;
Lat@@ ex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems will probably be returned to the package &amp; tex@@ ture ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution files . for installation , the documentation of distribution or installation disc should be attracted .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; -@@ project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for different distri@@ butions . these provide a simple installation without further comp@@ iling and are contained on the k@@ ile ; -@@ Website .
this hand@@ book is for everyone - regardless of the experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; KDE ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ;
advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions regarding the documentation is considered . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact via the k@@ ile ; -@@ Website should be made .
if questions or at comp@@ iling of &amp; k@@ ile ; upon or are extensions desired , this should be addressed on the mail@@ ing list k@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ setting for the use of all &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ functions in a graphical interface and within these a simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made tools for this . finally , the possibility to manipul@@ ate , compens@@ ated and conver@@ ters for this . finally , the easy to operate wi@@ z@@ ard , the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ reference and the powerful project management .
to know more about &amp; K@@ ate ; and his opportunities to experience the manual should be drawn up . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can there directly be connected to the reading of the chapters with the editor of &amp; K@@ ate .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right outlet : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . last@@ ly , it is also a La@@ ie ( engl@@ . L@@ ay ) &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros , can also be a less demanding but realistic sh@@ ear from Les@@ lie La m@@ port .

just as other sign@@ atories were included &amp; Lat@@ ex ; an introduction , with which the general @-@ related characteristics such as paper format , side @-@ num@@ bering and text enco@@ der starts with the command \ \ Docum@@ entary } and must be closed with the command \ \ \ { Document } .
the quick @-@ as@@ cent assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a conc@@ ert@@ ing function for the fast creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; . selecting the document . it enables you to place some of the document related settings .
documentation of documents : this will be the type of an error document : article ( article ) , letter &#91; Report &#93; , letter &#91; Report &#93; , article ( DIN ) , Review ( DIN ) &#91; Pl@@ ots &#93; , Pro@@ j@@ ector &#91; Be@@ amer &#93; , slides &#91; prosp@@ er &#93; or Custom @-@ defined .
co@@ ding : we should use the subscription of the system . modern systems use increasingly the UT@@ F @-@ 8 -@@ co@@ ding as standard . best should be UT@@ F @-@ 8x ( for correct processing of &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ Documents ) .
this list may be the most used au@@ xiliary packages for more &amp; lat@@ ex . for those working together only in the cross field .
article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of composite products ) . you should always find the use of German texts .
new users are not worried now . it is just a brief description of the functions and further information on this will be given in the section .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers - just like other source editors - the descent of the used statements , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ fitting ) . by &amp; k@@ ile ; it is nonetheless being closed by the mod@@ est appearance of the output current . however , it will be saved by the hum@@ ble appearance of the output of time and Ã ¶ r@@ ger .
with the automatic dispatch of the environments will be generated by entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ account { command } ) from &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically create an open line ( to enter the text ) and the d@@ az@@ ug@@ eh@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ige line to enter the command ( e.g. \ \ \ { command } ) . this function can be disabled in the menu and La@@ Te@@ X commands .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; you have the sub@@ mer@@ ging of the document into the following elements ( part is the cottage , and sub@@ tly the lowest element ) :
in the view of the document in the struc@@ ting view , you can place the individual elements with a mouse click on the respective post@@ pon@@ ed and be viewed .
when creating our own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful . once a DVI @-@ file ( Engl . D e V ice I n@@ igh file ) &#93; , jump &amp; k@@ ile ; by a click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ vie@@ wers on the corresponding line in &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ HTML text .
a DVI @-@ file sp@@ reads a description of form@@ att@@ ed document and also other information like the fon@@ ts of &amp; Te@@ x ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools to view , transformation and to print DVI ; files for different systems and rum@@ ors .
when using the wheels , the elements of the DVI ; -@@ file made with the editor and once on an element in the DVI ; -@@ source file was cli@@ cked on to a section in the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code was cli@@ cked , the corresponding location in the DVI ; -@@ viewer are sung .
Master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a Master document , the work with other integrated .@@ tex -@@ files will be simpli@@ fied . when using a project can be set a project @-@ wide master document .
quick@@ er : the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ HTML text is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if no error in the source code ) .
fil@@ esystem : in this mode the DVI ; -@@ file at Ã ¤ n@@ der@@ s@@ â and there is no call for &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick@@ er .
in consideration the processing tool@@ bar , the three sc@@ anned fields should be found in all . the selection of different elements have been developed into the document . the first exhau@@ st of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The Constitu@@ tional &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands for the sub@@ division are :
the selection range Fur@@ ther is for reference of articles such as keywords , fu@@ Ã or notes or references .
name : with this command a name will be created a section , a picture or different element created .
reference : will be used for reference to a fixed name ( choice ) ( choice ) .
if quot@@ ation from quote is shown a spin list of literature . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are corresponding editors . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; -@@ files you can also be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand .
the last selection field with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¶ e will be used to define the font , the font at the main text , the Fu@@ Ã ¤ Noten etc. are available . there are the following fon@@ ts :
the call of &amp; k@@ ile ; are two choices for refin@@ ement : 1 . the wi@@ z@@ ard for creating a new document by selecting the document settings . 2 . the document may be written by reason on hand .
the cl@@ as@@ ps according to the command \ \ Docum@@ ent@@ class contain the settings for the command . the set &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; defines the writing . the font should not be set at the beginning , this may also be sp@@ read@@ ed in the text .
once the upper source example has been given to the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ HTML @-@ implementation will be compiled . the easi@@ est way to this is the use of the Men@@ Ã ¼ s B@@ auen or the Kn@@ op@@ ter quick@@ er .
the HTML @-@ text must be stored in front of comp@@ iling . &amp; k@@ ile ; for the storage automatically .
if the comp@@ iling of the document fail , should be applied in the log@@ ging of errors . when using quick@@ er should be started and ey@@ epi@@ ece ; this is not the case , also the prot@@ oc@@ ols should be observed .
an environment ( English environment ) is a text that is different from the remaining document . the command \ \ begin { Environment } , \ \ \ and \ \ \ { Environment } .
the owners are only accessible within the environment ( from \ \ begin { Environment } to \ \ \ { Environment } ) .
there are many possibilities for the read@@ ability of the read@@ ability and usability of the document . it enables you to use specific fon@@ ts , obes@@ e , sub@@ missions , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands will either be added to the command \ \ or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the Short print and is until he is closed until he is closed with a \ \ { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in one set can be displayed with \ \ emp@@ h { word } cur@@ si@@ v .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ \ { quote } .
after the background to writing the source code with the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; section called the record , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide to create a document in &amp; k@@ ile ;
once the wi@@ z@@ ard has been given a bit text , a few adap@@ t@@ ations for the better read@@ ability of the document should be taken . to this should be a quote , a few places in the fat and cur@@ si@@ ves and a po@@ em to the application to see the differences of these commands .
once the document is seen , can be returned via editor @-@ view or Str@@ g E back to the editor ( when internal vie@@ wers ) . with an external spect@@ ator , its window must be closed .
once the DVI ; -@@ file was created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . easily try and fun .
DVI ; is a charming file format ( Engl . D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; Te@@ x ; or &amp; Lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ transform@@ ations or computer screen .
for the print of a &amp; DVI ; -@@ file are the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . during the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , then the document can be printed with file ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar set the conversion of the DVI ; -@@ file in other formats . once the DVI , -@@ file from the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ HTML @-@ text was created , the transformation can begin in cur@@ ing other formats using the button bar .
the prec@@ au@@ ation search for direct jump from the Editor to the d@@ az@@ ug@@ eh@@ Ã ¶ r@@ igen position within the DVI ; -@@ File .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ bin@@ aries . for this purpose you only need to set up modern under settings K@@ ile .
to search for the pre @-@ quot@@ ation , the mouse cursor is placed in a line of source tex@@ tiles and as@@ le@@ ep on curtains . the jump to the corresponding place in the DVI ; -@@ vie@@ wers will be carried out .
with this function in &amp; oc@@ ular ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI , -@@ document the corresponding &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ document of &amp; k@@ ile ; in &amp; oc@@ ular ; in &amp; oc@@ ular ; in &amp; oc@@ ular ; as Tex@@ te@@ di@@ tor ( settings Ok@@ ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
if you do not use quick@@ er of the &amp; DVI ; -@@ vie@@ wers can not occur . should an error occurs . should an error occurs , this is shown in the prot@@ oc@@ ols file or in the review window .
the prot@@ oc@@ ols file can be used in the source code . in the editor you can use the button @-@ free La@@ Te@@ X error and n@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X error detection and N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X error . to click on the error in the prot@@ oc@@ ols and &amp; k@@ ile ; jump to faul@@ ty line .
once on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window will appear to the selection of the template for the document . the pre @-@ made possibilities are :
the document can be used either from the basic document or to use the wi@@ z@@ ard for fast creation of a new document . more information can be found in the section .
FAQ - users of &amp; Lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for nearly all documents . templates enables you to be saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; Te@@ x ; - / Lat@@ ex ; -@@ file ge@@ Ã ¶ ff@@ net or a new file is created . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template using an existing document and selection of file template from document ...
when creating a new document from a template using a file New button will be replaced by other data ( such as name or string ) . these variables enables you to adjust to settings K@@ ile and settings to be submitted .
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which string chains are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLAS@@ SO@@ P@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : these string is replaced by entering into documentation class : \ \ Docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLAS@@ SO@@ P@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { article } .
the easi@@ est way to create a template is the use of the wi@@ z@@ ard and that associated with the commands of the commands in the Editor . once the document has been created in this way :
when creating a new document then the own template can be found instead of default .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files created in a simple way to create a template , should be sear@@ ched after one on the internet and the steps described below .
&amp; k@@ ate ; used &amp; K@@ ate ; as an internal editor . &amp; K@@ ate ; is a text editor of many different types of text ( including : Lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for you can be made directly from &amp; k@@ ile ; ) .
to know more about &amp; K@@ ate ; and its possibilities , the manual should be drawn up to K@@ ate . users can place there directly with the reading of the chapters with the editor of &amp; K@@ ate .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Command refer@@ enz , which can be called the Men@@ Ã ¼ aid La@@ Te@@ X reference . you can find an out@@ lined description of almost all commands , which in &amp; Lat@@ ex ; use can be found as well as their syntax .

the Edit is probably one of the main aspects associated with the use of a program such as &amp; k@@ ile ; . although &amp; K@@ ate ; already excellent fac@@ tions ; &amp; lat@@ ex ; ben@@ ds are always added to the writing of a &amp; lat@@ ex ; specific commands for their selection . in processing output , the following commands may include the text version :
choose a complete paragraph of ( group of rows , both included on both sides a blank lines ) . with a paragraph is not a text with cross @-@ level lines ( like in other text editor ) . this extended meaning and all the lines of the source process . it is therefore the only possible thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; is therefore that the voting can be separated by two empty lines .
choose the word under the current state @-@ position . this selection has also an extended meaning , as this command also &amp; lat@@ ex ; prec@@ epts with an open star ( * ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to the reading of a part of the document it may be removed from that first . &amp; K@@ ate ; offers the key element C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line will be removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers their own commands . among out@@ line dischar@@ ge are the following commands to the bottom of the text :
remo@@ ves a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is contained in the description to edit output .
it was already clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; Lat@@ ex ; therefore offering &amp; k@@ ile ; for NF further prec@@ epts in editing environment for a m@@ able easy work with &amp; lat@@ ex .
this command is sung by the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed right in front of the command to the local area .
with this command , to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed just behind the command to the lie@@ u of the surroundings .
if the cursor is before or within the command \ \ begin { Environment } at the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
during the entry of many wel@@ ded environmental commands can be lost quickly the Ã ¤ ber@@ blick . this command slept well , so that the dis@@ advant@@ aged ambient structure cannot be destroyed .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also provides special commands for the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ groups , which are determined by cl@@ as@@ ps { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands to meet those from editing environment .
with this command to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed right in front of the wel@@ ded cl@@ amps .
with this command the current position is sung by the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed right behind the wel@@ ded cl@@ amps .
if the cursor is before or behind the short@@ ened cl@@ amp of a &amp; Te@@ x ; -@@ group # is used to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
during the entry of many wel@@ ded groups @-@ brack@@ ets can get lost quickly at the Ã ¤ ber@@ tide . this command slept in the most recently printed structure , so that the dis@@ advant@@ aged structure of &amp; Te@@ x ; -@@ groups are not broken .
in &amp; Lat@@ ex ; two simple installation mark can be used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the character &quot; for two simple installation mark can be used . also for the operator , the character is used . &amp; k@@ hur@@ ry ; knows this case and also the two slept in addition to Lat@@ ex .
this automatic fil@@ ing of the double standard sign can be set under settings K@@ ile eu@@ al@@ ign ... La@@ Te@@ X - and off .
it is also possible to use a specific settings ( e.g. n@@ ate or French ) and thus German or French courses . there are also many other languages available .
when the drinks of Shi@@ ft ; initi@@ ate &amp; k@@ ile ; a smart line . if the current position within a lists ( such as en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , for instance , not just a lin@@ ec@@ break , but at the same time the command \ \ item .
within a tables ( near ) and k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ \ with a as@@ le@@ ep start break .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to under@@ weight bor@@ row@@ ed &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or Custom environments . these enables you to set up under adjustments ... La@@ Te@@ X added .
some users want to arrange the sp@@ old in tables ( amp ; ) with each other . &amp; k@@ ile ; try this to er@@ ate . when this tab@@ ulator is not the d@@ ability ; after the Nav@@ al tab@@ ulator in the dar@@ ker . although this tab@@ ulator is not the d@@ az@@ ed , for the sp@@ old position of the current tab@@ ulator .
although &amp; K@@ ate ; already offers a good source extension . it has been expanded in &amp; k@@ ile ; for special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) are still extended to different modes . all these modes can be able to set different working methods under settings K@@ ile .
when you start a new environment using the command \ \ begin { Environment } &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically the command \ \ { Environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) added .
when choosing the R@@ Ã ¼ hl@@ p , the last letter is removed from entering and m@@ Ã ¶ g@@ ably ver@@ Ã ¶ ger , this is the complete list of goods . on the other hand , the list may also be simpli@@ fied by entering a further letter .
all commands will be written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively you will be able to choose from &amp; k@@ ile ; also a jumping from &amp; k@@ ile ; also jumping , so a simply jump to these positions by processing jumping mat &apos;s jumping mat and the arous@@ ed parameters then enables you to place .
under settings k@@ ile ; direct access to these lists are to be made . it enables you to use different des@@ el@@ ers &amp; Te@@ x ; - and &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands , as well as w@@ aders of the general language use .
the command will not be used for perf@@ ected environments . it will always be given a few letters with \ \ begin and the call of the perfection . on the other hand , the environments will be used as often , that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for refin@@ ement of the environments .
in the call of the complete environment or the sc@@ anned environment or the sc@@ anning range of old + switch @-@ switch of the environment is automatically added and it appears \ \ begin { . afterwards , the ambient temperatures will be continued by means of sim@@ pl@@ est way and by pus@@ hing of input taste .
after this is accomplished , the environment will automatically be closed once again . once &amp; k@@ ile ; recognize that it is a lists of an lists , it is even a first \ \ item with a fil@@ ename .
under settings k@@ ile ; direct settings to these lists can be made . this mode uses the equ@@ alisation list of the full @-@ country mode for the full @-@ country mode for purchase ; and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; k@@ ile ; under@@ scor@@ ed custom lists of de@@ duc@@ tions , which will immediately be replaced by default navig@@ able ... K@@ ile res@@ ellers . as an example of the subscription list , the file exam@@ ple@@ .c@@ w@@ l , in the example of the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , the letter L is given by the letter L and the word for perf@@ ected al@@ location or the sc@@ anning range , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gro@@ Ã ¤ n@@ Ã ¶ l@@ ter may not be helpful . however , it has been observed that many people are written in a document more than once . with it , &amp; k@@ ile ; the perfection for all already written r@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this mode can be set in the Men@@ Ã ¼ settings K@@ ile im@@ perfection ... K@@ ile Ver@@ ful@@ ler . here , the Fly@@ bar can also be set for the display of the completed .

PS -@@ files are not as well @-@ known as PDF files , but also provide an excellent basis for both sides and re@@ visions of pages . the PDF output will be newly created , so enables the pages to be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; -@@ tools newly created and then with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file .
to place the outcome of the work has to be able to place an increasing the source code . all the tools are group@@ ed in the Men@@ Ã ¼ s creating comp@@ iling , creating and put forward momentum .
for the comp@@ iling of the source directory for viewer , such as &amp; oc@@ ular ; or the other conversion can be used by the DVI ; 3 . afterwards the DVI ; file is converted by the old ; 3 the DVI ; 4 the DVI ; -@@ file into a PS file , and via Alt ; 5 the PS file is wat@@ ched .
when using the command quick@@ er is normally called a viewer after the comp@@ iling . should not be used in @-@ un@@ ener spect@@ ator , every time a new window will be used .

a completely refurbished re@@ ern@@ ess for &amp; Te@@ x ; and intake â but rather than a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather it is ideal for finding a specific form@@ atting . since it is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; k@@ ile ; in three important book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents with those &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ ture is delivered , the finding the right document does not always offer . as a tex@@ tual help offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ ture ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k to which a database with all to &amp; k@@ ile ; delivered documents and therein .

often , working on a project several people in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the indication of team members and these can be configured using Shi@@ ft ; F@@ 7 Projekt Project @-@ features .
the name and email entries are self @-@ made . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and serves to clear identification .
a member may have several roles within the project as well as a sub@@ project leader .
the user can look out even from the list of the team members who he is . this happens by drawing the team member of the list , and the button is set as pressed . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears according to the you are : text .
nick@@ name and setting of your own identity are important in terms of news and comments . see for further information on notes .
besides the overview of your team there is another advantage by collecting the members of the team : it can be an event for information to the team manager if something is happening . see in for further information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something particular in the project happens . an example would be seen how much someone is saved , or sending a message when a file is saved , or a script that plays a file into CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc .
on the page of the Shi@@ ft @-@ Con@@ figuration of the Shi@@ ft ; F@@ 7 project project settings , it can be created , edited and deleted .
an em@@ mail will be sent to the recipi@@ ents in the receiver -@@ list . the addres@@ see can be a team or sub@@ project leader . see , W@@ ei such lad@@ der will be set up .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments through the following things :
notes to enter is simple . it can either choose the note @-@ entry from the editor display or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a comm@@ ent@@ ext .
notes can be sent to a team member of the team . in this case the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , whereby the name of the name sub@@ project leaders should be specified in the following areas and sub@@ project lad@@ ders , as shown in the following examples below .
nick@@ name and roles names are independent of big - or small @-@ p@@ elling , but spaces around the cl@@ as@@ ps and the : make the note sle@@ eves .

the settings can be called Qu@@ anta by settings Qu@@ anta . this dialog extends over some pages that will be dealt with to each other .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; related to tags including car can be modified . the entries are :
large / inf@@ ancy of tags : large / small @-@ enco@@ ded of tags . normal Groß / inf@@ ancy means , the tags will be so inserted , as they are described in the day XML files .
big / inf@@ ancy by attri@@ bute : large / lo@@ wer@@ ed by attributes . normal Groß / inf@@ ancy means , the attributes are inserted , as they are described in the day XML files .
optional tags automatically close : if asp@@ act , is optional for tags , for which the end day is optional , this immediately added to the bed .
non @-@ optional tags automatically include : as above for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags .
start and finish @-@ date automatically update : if swit@@ ched , the corresponding resolution will be changed and vice versa .
automatic ass@@ ign@@ ation of acc@@ ent signs : controls the automatic conversion of cor@@ ent@@ u@@ ed characters into the corresponding enco@@ ding during income .
MI@@ ME types : Mim@@ et@@ ypes for detection of different types of files . by means of the default default , the default form@@ ations can be restored .
standard character string : the co@@ ding of newly created or in other way than with file opening an open files ( where the co@@ ding of the file can be v@@ ented ) . this setting here is out@@ lined by the same in the project properties , if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD has not been recognised . this setting here is out@@ lined by the same in the project properties , if a project is loaded .
create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates regularly backup copies , so that with a power loss or cr@@ ashing the next start of the program the document of this backup can be restored . even if not stored documents is created a backup regularly , according to the given time , created .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the preview and documentation may either be shown in the editing of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; editing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or viewing the documentation ( or the documentation on a box ) , which makes it possible to watch the documentation , the preview and the source file at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can display the indication of symbols instead of scripts , as well as the synchronization of the V@@ PL@@ - and the HTML @-@ text view in the shared mode . in terms of different modes , see .
here , the par@@ ser and the structural tree , which represents the picture of the Par@@ ser kn@@ ots in the document in detail .
in the field of mouse @-@ click on the structural tree , it is possible to change the action by clicking the structural building with the cursor to change action .
in the field of structural settings , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the re@@ ment@@ ing of the building can be automatically opened to edit . the no@@ des are the empty areas in the text , while blank groups are not found in which the current document was not found .
the area to consoli@@ date abbreviations ( a type of templates ) which can be un@@ folded in groups , each can be divided for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s , it can be a valid group for PHP , in which the if@@ cl@@ ause abbrevi@@ ation have something else than in a group valid for Javascript .
here , the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plugins are K@@ Part @-@ applications from third page that can be re @-@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ enabled application ; in the most known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ;
address : the path to the plugin if it is not in a standard place like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
entry : this information is transferred to the plugin when you start , it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .

check the plugin : this is activated , then t@@ ested &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; whether the entered information is right . we also allows the memory of the device even if the plug in the moment is not available , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; starting version 3.3 , the bug@@ ging is completely new developed . di@@ e@@ support for the no longer required built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead of this became a de@@ bug@@ ger @-@ Plugin concept that allows a de@@ bug@@ ger @-@ Plugin concept .
currently is only a plugin available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
the use of the de@@ bug@@ ger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bug@@ ger @-@ plug @-@ ins in the project settings . with the button options next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin selection , the specific settings can be changed .
if for a project a de@@ bug@@ ger is activated , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ user interface :
a view in which the contents of overweight variables is displayed . appears in the left Dock .
a view in which all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . appears in the lower dock .
a view in which the output is shown in the output ( as in HTML ) of de@@ bug@@ ger . appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bug@@ ger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action the connection to de@@ bug@@ ger , if necessary , or she shares the plugin with , on Deb@@ u@@ gan@@ try to lau@@ tern . this action is opened by default if a project is not used , so that a de@@ bug@@ ger must not be ignored .
the counter@@ part of Deb@@ ug@@ gen session Star@@ te the session . includes the connection to the de@@ bug@@ ger or ends the p@@ enny according to requirements .
sends a HTTP requirement to the server around a de@@ bug requirement . this is the same with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this requirement is displayed in the opinion of de@@ bug@@ ger issue .
indicates the de@@ bug@@ ger to begin with the execution of the scripts , and the information about the surveillance variables , as well as the currently carried out line continuously . if this happens during the script , the execution is continued , before a de@@ bug@@ ging requirement was begun , starts the script with the request .
points out the de@@ bug@@ ger to begin with the execution of scripts , without information regarding monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens when a script was given , running the execution continues . it happens before a de@@ bug@@ ging requirement was beginning as soon as a requirement is provided .
the de@@ bug@@ ger leads the next statement in the script without entering into the functions or Incl@@ udes .
the de@@ bug@@ ger leads the next statement in the script where possible in functions and Incl@@ udes occur .
points the de@@ bug@@ ger to move the instruction and go to the next one , as if there would not be the current one .
opens up a dialog , where a variable or an expression can be entered , the monitored value appears in the variable view .
this dialog can be set to a variable or set a new value of a variable .

this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to adapt to your needs and how you can help &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; help to become better .
document type E@@ ditions ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; they allow &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . they allow &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; skills as car can make &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two ways , family 1 , the mark @-@ up languages and family 2 , the script shell or &amp; CSS ; s consist of two parts , the day folder and the tool@@ bar .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be susp@@ ended ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . see in for details of conversion .
this document describes how tag@@ XML files are to create , then the &amp; des@@ crip@@ ts ; and also tool@@ bar . short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and content of the self @-@ contract ; file contains the rules and information of &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bar can make a quick in@@ ser@@ ting tags in a document without danger of writing .
day @-@ folder are nothing but folder . they contain only the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ n@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . day @-@ folder carry the name of the writ@@ ers language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.01 @-@ volume )
the table below lists the elements of the meeting XML and de@@ cl@@ oned whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible , so that other users have a better insight and more information in working with them .
the following chapter describes every element in detail . everything about the possibilities and borders is described in a simple way .
this is the root element of a meeting document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but it contains only the item type over itself nothing else .
the type of tags is a script function . when using it is &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only for the day type class is valid . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only applicable to the type of enclosure is valid . gives the name of the class where this method belongs to . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has an e @-@ attri@@ bute and the attributes in this tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ Day is determined . this is an only @-@ element Type element .
describes a attri@@ bute of a tags . this item can only occur once for each attri@@ bute . additionally it defines the name and type of attri@@ bute . additionally it contains more tags , descri@@ bing how this attri@@ bute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is an only @-@ element -@@ Type @-@ element .
returns the source code used for the attributes in the day @-@ Edi@@ tor@@ dialog and in the attri@@ bute tree .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p Metho@@ ds within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a def@@ ective and a method@@ ology . the arguments that are transferred to the method . may be empty or % day name , which means the name of the current tags .
a container @-@ day the elements of a list are group@@ ed . it can only occur for a attri@@ bute to only once . it is a mere element of element .
defines the position of the attri@@ but@@ t of a tags within a dialog . this day can occur for every attri@@ bute in a dialogue only once ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
returns the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for each field in dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; day ) . this element is empty .
indicates a list of elements that may occur within the functioning tags . this element is an only one @-@ item type .
indicates a list of elements that end a day . this element is an only @-@ item type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with an &amp; XML ; -@@ De@@ vices : &amp; lt : ? XML version = 1.0 enco@@ ding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and have to be closed and closed .
no signs influence nothing but pay attention to &amp; and &amp; lt : character . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; replaced . this will not be replaced , but some pieces of the work would disappear .
to review the Tag@@ XML files , the tools is set up in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; window windows to start and insp@@ ected Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialogue will appear to follow its simple instructions .
this feature is currently not available . currently , the verification is only at the load of the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
in the following example for a family 1 tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; -@@ item from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ Sch@@ ema . the fil@@ ename for this day file should be sch@@ em@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following an example of a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ l@@ ade function described . the fil@@ ename of this day file is to be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; lt : ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; enco@@ ding = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Name = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &gt; &amp; lt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just fairly simple and there is an editor which can be easily accessible via D@@ TD Bear@@ bei@@ te D@@ TD Sett@@ ings ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; des@@ crip@@ tive ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ TD HTML 4.01 Tran@@ si@@ tional / / EN ) nick@@ name = The simpli@@ fied name of the D@@ TD . ( HTML 4.01 Tran@@ si@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is considered nick@@ name .
a action may be created with settings promotions ... click on new action to get the same dialogue :
this promotion will be assigned to the key@@ ring . with clicking the button can be assigned a key@@ ring . with K@@ one is the current key@@ ring .
the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . it can be entered a text in the determin@@ ant settings and included with the execution of action this text is inserted in the document at the current byte position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful shar@@ p@@ yp . with the help of this action you can use external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not restricted ) to change the document or as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; themselves are the quick start @-@ dialog , or the different Read in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter are stated . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Script . sh .
although qualified paths allowed , it is advisable to use the scrip@@ ted variable in the commands : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / image in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file : / from the document name .
% P@@ ID : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; only one instance is running , the text goes to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; by external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ ename of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the above @-@ hand methods can use a script inputs of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in the default input . in the selection mode input may be determined , which is to be sent to standard assignment .
selected text : the selected part of the document is sent to the script . the % path variable is usually sensible only with this setting .
according to the input , the output can be re@@ directed to the application . there are two types of output : standard output , on the default version . it can be specified , which is set by default the default written text by default the value of the selection range is set :
if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . in the given case it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the market .
once a tool@@ bar is added , you must add promotions and configure your settings promotions .
the parts of this window are fairly self @-@ made . press the New action button at the bottom of the window starts the Edit mode .
complete all the fields and add the day to the right tool@@ bar .
complete all and , in case of the day attributes , and you are planning their use , enable dialogue &quot; day , if available so that a input when writing your action is possible .
Ig@@ itt ! is that a ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbols that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; k@@ ic@@ on@@ edit ; select from the &amp; k@@ menu ; , graphics other programs ( or where else it is located at your distribution ) .
&amp; k@@ ic@@ on@@ edit ; used by default 3@@ 2x@@ 32 pixel , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size rest .
please note that the created icon is not only helps you to remember what the action is doing , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P .
with regard to that the day start , I have decided to create a run@@ kno@@ b as a symbol . through the use of green ( green will usually be interpreted as wrong , rig@@ ged to continue , or should at least , a message to the user , then clicking this symbols must be a &amp; lt ; working day in the current document .
after the creation of the symbols must be linked to the action . this happens via the menu with settings promotions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selection of the desired action . next to the text field is an kno@@ b , press him .
select the folder in which the stored symbol is , select it and confirm with OK .
press the button button and continue with other tags , such as there is still , or confirm with OK to complete .
supp@@ ose you want to complement some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ functions for the tool@@ bar . open the tool@@ bar set in several groups . open the tool@@ bar set up dialog by settings tool@@ bar . make sure that the desired tool is selected .
I want to choose the den@@ omin@@ ator ( very left ) for my work tool@@ bar . after the selection of the element that is to be added to the tool@@ bar , you press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar .
I would like to add a quick way to access the con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the tool@@ bar .
please note , as the den@@ omin@@ ator can support the group@@ ing . anyone who knows my work tool@@ bar , could believe that the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button on the opposite of the start @-@ head .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by Pro@@ bi@@ eren of all symbols to ensure that everything works .
backup in the right folder . after Neu@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be stored in the right folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be loaded in the right folder . please adjust their tool@@ bar ( s ) if a file is opened from the appropriate type .
perhaps the mentioned extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the opportunity to add documentation for scripts , or the form@@ atting speech , which you like most . therefore describes this chapter as I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory check if somebody has done already for you .
there are two parts in this process . first , you need to search an existing documentation for form@@ atting - / script / etc . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . the first part we leave you to treat the second we treat here .
# KDE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , # Sec@@ urities Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.1.@@ 1.1 Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.1.@@ 3.@@ html = Sec@@ 2.@@ html 2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 3@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ ged html
the section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentary tree . for example , you can now see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation as something :
# KDE config File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level , # 4.2 Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = index.html @-@ Start@@ ed = In@@ tro@@ duction = In@@ tro@@ duction = In@@ tro@@ duction = In@@ tro@@ duction = In@@ tro@@ duction = In@@ tro@@ duction = In@@ tro@@ duction = In@@ tro@@ duction = In@@ tro@@ duction = In@@ tro@@ duction = In@@ tro@@ duction = In@@ tro@@ duction , ... Basic database = lan@@ gu@@ ag@@ e.@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tac@@ .html ...
note the # before start@@ ed and Language Reference . this shows that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known border for the box levels ( except the reason ) m@@ d@@ ash , but try it yourself .
you notice that the content of the directory is directly listed on a file ( and consistent at the top end of the Bau@@ man@@ vision &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder will be displayed ! ) .
no signs influence nothing , but pay attention to &amp; and &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . resources .
the ingredients section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file that is intended to be shown in writing a &amp; PHP ; scripts , the documentation for the mys@@ ql _ fetch _ array function is to be displayed . by mark the function named and Dr@@ ying of C@@ tr@@ l ; H for context the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context menu ( cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file binding .
a simple list of both conf@@ isc@@ ated context elements that are to be available ( for &amp; PHP ; and these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c to $ HOME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc for local and global use . then create a folder in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation .
if you are sure that these well and value are being shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation have been used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ comm@@ union . they will not be rich , but proud of it to have worked on the best web developments .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you are not alone . it is possible to divide the resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bar with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by e @-@ mail to friends , partners or otherwise whom can send an email menu item , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) via email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in scripts tree .
the resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive , where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ users can download them . the contributions are veri@@ fied and only available when our team is considered correct and us@@ fully responsible for publication . thus , the origin of the resource is guaranteed , both for our team as well as for later users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for their private G@@ PG key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private G@@ PG key ) , or in the case you can share a search . in dialog new resource you have to pass on . in dialogue New resource you must stay empty ( URL @-@ preview can be empty ) and with you click OK to upload the up@@ loading .
the up@@ loading can upload the menu D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) upload , tool@@ bar , and in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree began .
after downloading a resource , still before installing , investig@@ ating &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the in@@ vers@@ y of the resource by checking the integrity and the Sig@@ ni@@ fication . in case of problems it is given and it can then be canc@@ eled carefully . if the integrity are given and the resource is correctly signed , a message with the indication of the author of the resource .
it is possible to work to XML languages which is currently not being created by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it is necessary to work by a D@@ TE@@ P package . the creation can be time @-@ consuming , because hundreds of day files in the day XML format may be necessary . there is the easi@@ est way to convert a D@@ TD automatically to a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the D@@ TD charging and Convert a D@@ TD . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD description which should be used . afterwards the following dialogue appears :
target @-@ name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with that name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ C@@ TY@@ PE Defini@@ tions : the string , which is in ! DO@@ C@@ TY@@ PE day , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.01 Tran@@ si@@ tional / / EN http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / lo@@ os@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d
F@@ use of D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after conversion the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tor ; -@@ Editor , with the details of newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; there are some key concepts . to understand this and full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; they have to do so first with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to help them exactly these concepts without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; little benefits rest .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the work area is divided into three areas : global , locally and projection . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ r .
global elements are available for everyone who is marked &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; cookies is all that is marked by a globally structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this allows the group of administr@@ ators different tool@@ bar , actions and patterns in the global tree , which will be available in a multi @-@ user environment at the system .
local elements introduce a personal collection of web developer for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bar . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related items are available only within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; -@@ patterns to work with special promotions specially designed for the files of a particular project . simply said , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree and patterns of all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ MDI ; consists of several main areas : the Edi@@ ting window , the map views , the box with information and the tool@@ bar . please refer to , and for further information about these areas .
you can click on the box with the right mouse button to download a context menu with the current documentation , such as the current , other or any boxes , re@@ charging , delete or up@@ loading of the document , jump to a book@@ marks or execution of CV@@ S @-@ commands to the current document .
right click in the editing process to a further context menu regarding the revised document , such as basic mach@@ ining steps ( out / paste / paste ) , processing under the mouse @-@ indic@@ ator of tags , help to the word under the mouse cursor or opening the file when the string po@@ inter is referred to a file .
at the top of the editor , the tool@@ bar of the editor is at present &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.01 Tran@@ si@@ tional as standard for which one set of tool@@ bar will be shown . in the course of further elabor@@ ation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the tool@@ bar is adapted to the new features and connected user needs .
the use of tool@@ bar is really easy . if they want to insert a simple day , e.g. &amp; lt ; p@@ gt ; in their document , then click on . now she can insert the data for this just before ( like an@@ chor ) , you can fill in a dialogue different fields .
the building @-@ view ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow it to navigate in the information of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , they are open and en@@ umer@@ able . in the representation with cart@@ els are available for files , project , scripts , scripts , and documentation .
project management is a powerful tool that provides all files in the project and allows the handling of the files in the project by a legal mouse click . actions like Ad@@ ding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ e@@ tion of the files from storage media can be performed with the displayed context menu .
another way of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , exec@@ utable , a whole website &amp; etc ; There are all possible options open .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on which connection they are used . the category depends on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; working area . global templates are always available , local templates only for the relevant users and templates in projects are available only in the project .
here you will find information about the available scripts . the concept of the integration in Global , locom@@ otive and project is also available here . by clicking on the right mouse button you can start the available information on a script . on the right mouse button are available , such as the script to edit or send to mail .
with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . through links @-@ clicking on the item of the element . by right @-@ clicking of an element opens a list of commands in terms of navigation and dri@@ fting of the tree .
this tree appears under the other construction sites . with it can change man@@ ly attributes and nam@@ ing rooms . it allows modification of all available attributes with few clicks .
here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; documentation pages , one can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be proj@@ ected and viewed .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two boxes will be reached at the bottom of the window , about the beneficial information can be reached : the messages window and the problem window .
this box will display information about each in Qu@@ anta running script , such as the D@@ TD version of the current document and all changes to the D@@ TD .
this box will display all errors in the aw@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts , which are executed , give all error registrations ( so that gives ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bar is extensive range and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and you will receive the appropriate command . the chocolate page of the tool@@ bar is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ;
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool@@ bar as compres@@ sed air @-@ archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you get a tool@@ bar in an email , they can save it in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as any other backup and load !
it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ files placed on your system . therefore , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be given to the configure script . for a complete list of all options can be given . / configure --@@ help one . the options are simple to understand and not executed here .
if you have trouble passing by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you should check if your path includes the &amp; KDE ; 3 bin folder . also you should ensure that no older version of &amp; KDE ; 3 in PAT@@ H before her bin Fol@@ der . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a Web development tool for KDE @-@ surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; was optimized for a rapid Web @-@ development and combines a well @-@ made development environment with a multitude of leg@@ acy functions .
while trying to create the best &amp; HTML ; -@@ Editor , began the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a stand@@ alone , ext@@ end@@ able Mark@@ up @-@ editor would be ? well , this would make him completely a great web development tool for &amp; KDE ! so it was done .
no longer limited to re@@ ines &amp; HTML ; restricted is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now close to a general and comprehensive web development system . merge : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then you should be &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for this the appropriate &amp; IDE .
well , to the above mentioned above must be determined , that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; as a product is based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; KDE ; development . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows , in good application of free software , the idea of why it has been possible ? thanks to the &amp; KDE ; -@@ Ger@@ ü@@ st is not only this everything possible , but allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to extend it to their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows web developers the use of a intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( MDI ; ) . this can extend the productivity dramatically . by the program comp@@ assi@@ sting them &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; expand , without yourself ir@@ g@@ ently a scrip@@ ting language tax . ( more about it in . )
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web developer environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for a quick web development and quickly expanded to a well @-@ known editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way linked with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GPL @-@ licensed version and manufactured a commercial program .
more in the details and documentation is available with help : / qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; enter or k@@ help@@ center help : / qu@@ anta ) .

this allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for later use . look in the section about templates . should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project recording .
convert to insert from the cli@@ p@@ board there are special characters to &amp; HTML ; -@@ sh@@ ell@@ ation , so that they are correctly displayed correctly and not be understood by the browser as form@@ atting assignment .
convert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ sn@@ mp , which is the correct way to insert a special character and space sign in &amp; URL ; s is used primarily to in@@ ser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s in the an@@ chor day .
swit@@ ched the block@@ ages to or from . that allows you to select tex@@ ture with the help of the &amp; Shi@@ ft ; taste .
move directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script error leaves !
seeks a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a sort of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expres@@ sions to help you .
displays the messages window or not to . that is the window in which you see the ad of scripts and the de@@ bug@@ ger .
- and switching of the problem of problem @-@ por@@ ters at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ r . the problem @-@ por@@ ter is activated , as soon as it changes to structural tree .
displays the tool@@ bar left of the main window . this column allows you to put book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries PRE@@ VIO@@ US or neighbour@@ ly appear , depending on the position of the cursor in the document .
book@@ marks from other ge@@ y documents will be group@@ ed in the menu according to the fil@@ ename of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ projects are stored with the fil@@ ter@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to insert files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
sear@@ ches the project directory for new files that could be there . it enables , e.g. graphic files in your project folder or sub@@ folder , and add it to the project .
loads the files in your project on the server high . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; KDE ; and whether you have downloaded further input / output modules ( KI@@ O sl@@ aves ) .
settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project managed . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ projects find the details explained .
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are preserved in project you / tool@@ bar and are only shown in this menu if you ref@@ used it to this project .
a dialog to store your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : locally or Project .
opens up a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions must be stored by means of settings ...
removed a tool@@ bar from the point of view . the del@@ etes it not from the hard disk . if you do not have not saved the tool@@ bar , you will be asked if you want to do this .
with this you can send her own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ team , so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next release . the menu item opens a new e @-@ mail message with the tool@@ bar as an app@@ endi@@ x .
allows the up@@ loading of tool@@ bar to the main server , where any other can access it . see in .
download a &amp; D@@ TD ; that you made or irrit@@ ating someone else has made and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own descriptions .
download / re@@ fresh the entities from &amp; D@@ TD ; . is advisable if the entities from &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; to ren@@ ew , without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; to ren@@ ew , without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this global one is not present in the global KDE folder , fail the shop .
this menu provides a list of tags , which is loaded into the currently used tool@@ bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there are in the tags menu a sub@@ menu standard , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current day range dialog , if there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tags , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
enabled or de@@ activated the intelligent addition of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . smart In@@ ser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the in@@ ser@@ ting by means of tool@@ bar , when this day is speaking at this place to the rules .
in the plug @-@ in the plug @-@ in @-@ ins menu the available plug @-@ ins among the above mentioned menu points listed . click on it . click on an additional plug @-@ ins .
choose the syn@@ taxes item for the current file . the list of available Her@@ vor@@ heb@@ en@@ sch@@ em@@ ata depends on the k@@ ate ; -@@ version .
choose the type of line service identification . very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms for disposal . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; D@@ TD ; using the external application tidy .
immediate switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the KDE libraries can cause or un@@ clear graphics , which is also default the box mode , which is also the default mode , which is the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
additionally , this menu for each open sub@@ window provides an entry . with a selection of a dec@@ ages the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated .
swit@@ ched the display of the status bar at the bottom of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main f@@ enst@@ ers .
the changes in this dialog boxes every application that use the K@@ HTML Part , including the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Web browser .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behavior of the editor &apos;s behavior is one . in the documentation of &amp; K@@ ate ; you can find details . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a dialog appears in which you delete items from the tool@@ bar or add and the sequ@@ ences can change .
this should be a help in accordance with the po@@ inter of mouse cursor , but it is not yet implemented .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and freely licensed projects , however , as with any open source project , the developers can always support help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ development in financial form , they find here the way .
the fields are self @-@ made and should be filled up at the top from above down@@ wards , since e.g. after the filling out of the project named the whole directory for the rest of the project . all these paths and author @-@ information can be set later with Shi@@ ft ; F@@ 7 project project properties can be set .
here is the name for the project to enter , for example fo@@ o . when entering name is file automatically filled .
this is the name of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ project file . by default , she has the name of the project in small letters and without space with the extension of web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can access the Server@@ address of the machine , to which one wants to access local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
lets this field blank , the default settings of the selected log files are used . depending on the setting of the remote computer could be an adaptation necessary .
that is the folder that are stored in templates for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files are used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of standards .
this is the folder that will be saved in the tool@@ bar for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bar . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of standards .
this allows files to add files from the local file system to the project . it can be selected multiple files or whole folder .
this setting is great , if you have static web , which you can download and change . with ser@@ ver@@ tex scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
anal act if files are stored somewhere in the main folder of the project . if a project is started on new , does not attach ho@@ oks .
with this option all files and folder will be shown within the main folder and you can make a precise choice of man@@ or .
this indicates a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by pressing or , by removing the her@@ b@@ bon , cl@@ as@@ ps out of the project .
the last screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that allows your work simplify . these settings can upload in the menu with the project properties in the menu room in the bottom window , or with the key@@ ring Shi@@ ft . F@@ 7 is changed .
some settings meet those in the project assistant and are described in . the additional items are explained below .
a list of fil@@ ename ( place @-@ card possible ) , which are re@@ produced in @-@ related operations such as project @-@ related operations such as project folder .
add an option to above , also files that are listed in .c@@ v@@ sign@@ or are excluded from the project .
the project view , which will be loaded during the opening of the project . in it can be read more about project views .
there@@ with , the desired de@@ bug@@ ger may be selected . currently , Gub@@ ed will be supported . more information about Gub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger @-@ Plugin can be set by the Options . in the de@@ bug@@ ging process can be described .
in the sub@@ window profiles , high @-@ load profiles ( see in ) can be set as well as the display of a client view for each profile , which is attached to its own building perspective for each profile .
in the under@@ window team configuration can be added to project managers , processed or deleted as well as a mail@@ ing list . see the details .
in the sub@@ window directory , one can switch event @-@ actions and add these actions , change or delete . event transactions are executed if a previously certain event occurs , like about the vic@@ tor of a file . see in the details .
standard opens &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was opened . this behaviour is currently not influence .
to open a different project , select project from the menu or the icon project opening from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will open and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file will be automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files if you want a new project .
the project management gives free access to the files in the project . there , data can be managed in the current project .
folder is also true , but are missing entries open and opening up with ... in with the right mouse button @-@ able context menu :
here you can see different profiles . the profile contains information on the site of the upload files . see .
allows the del@@ e@@ tion of the current profile . if only there is a profile present , the button will be ab@@ used to prevent the removal .
the password is kept on core memory and is useful when programmer . this possibility is useful when most common up@@ loading files is necessary and the rather un@@ secure password will be saved on the record -@@ option not in question .
this will stop the transmission or simply leave dialog by changing your opinion prior to the up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; many high @-@ la@@ de@@ profiles can be created and so that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be up@@ loaded to different servers . when processing , or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
that is the name of the server to be copied to the files . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address .
the transfer protocol for the up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; KDE ; and the installed ki@@ o sl@@ aves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and n@@ fs .
the port for transfer . normally this does not have to change , except the network administrator does not operate a service to the usual port .
depending on your att@@ endant , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use them according to your discretion . the password is not easy to be read , but each with programmer can be easily seen in the plain text .
a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bar . it can be loaded in a project many views , i.e. by simple exchange of view can be loaded and replace several files and tool@@ bar and replace the currently open files and tool@@ bar .
views can be opened in the menu or the project tool@@ bar , accessible via settings tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , opened or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows adjustment of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ r .
as mentioned above are a tool@@ bar in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; best via the menu tool@@ bar . use and Ad@@ ding differ . the Ad@@ ding of tool@@ bar is treated in the section Ad@@ ding of tool@@ bar .
the tool@@ bar and the symbols can be prepared either by the context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar , there can be other actions like a tool@@ bar , tool@@ bar or tool@@ bar , where can be specified in dialog box where actions can be visible on this or other work@@ ings .
by calling the context menu to a action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , in addition the entries will remove and action have been edited , the self @-@ made .
the tool@@ bar and the actions on them can be set in the menu with settings tool@@ bar ... and settings promotions are set ..
templates are in essential documents , code sc@@ ams and files to link@@ ed@@ . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used templates such as a common file system with ext@@ end@@ able organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or each of the system existing directory in the storage room . templates have to be found in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in some of the restrictions you put in the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions at the beginning of each template , the conditions used before use .
bin@@ ary is all , which is not pur@@ er text . it can be added any file except text , so pictures , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; bin@@ ary . some examples can be used in documents using a global templates . further information about Tem@@ plates tree is available .
documents can be created from any text document . on basis of these templates can be created new documents . usually , special rum@@ ors for the purpose and organiz@@ es the work in an appropriate manner to be efficient . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information about Tem@@ plates tree .
these types of templates is useful when not a new document based on a template but the same text area can be added again into the documents . you can find everything from a comment on a final test system on Javascript or Perl base . some examples are listed under global templates . see for more information about Tem@@ plates tree .
as the name says , serve these templates for whole websites as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summar@@ ised in a compres@@ sed air archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
design an documentation for Bel@@ i@@ eben ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and choose File As a template , save as local template ....
once the done is , notice that ( even if it was visible as a project model ) which is visible not in the project tree . look at the pre@@ disp@@ osition under the project templates .
choose text in your document and click on file as a template
the creation of bin@@ ary templates is simple : the file can only be used only in a subur@@ b . it can be used all file management functions , such as ornam@@ ental and distr@@ actions or in@@ ser@@ ting through the file tree of con@@ quer@@ or .
you can select a folder on the right side or in the project files with a folder on the right and site template , select a name for template and secure . by default is secured in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as local or global template .
project templates enable a very target @-@ oriented advance . you can insert head@@ lines and foot@@ lines , or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; design , files to insert files or associated with them . in addition , you can keep some things in touch of templates in projects very profound .
the storage structure in the under@@ window templates is based on the $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / Tem@@ plates and $ HOME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / Tem@@ plates . each of this folder corresponds to one of four types of tank , as above .
to set the behavior of a folder calendar with the right mouse button click on the folder and select the context menu features . the following dialogue appears :
a selection range with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is de@@ pos@@ ited as soon as El@@ ter@@ al attributes is hal@@ ted .
this is enabled by default and p@@ inch for everything except the regular folders in the board survey . if a regular folder would be dis@@ able in this path , except they would be explicitly activated . in the event of a normal folder , the flo@@ wer@@ ah would appear to something like text tree . if nothing appears , one is probably in a regular folder .
allows modification or veri@@ fied text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ lines for all templates for a specific project and allows head of ingredients for a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ lines .
in addition , you are using the context menu ( to show right mouse button ) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; HTML @-@ Editor , which contains over the menu view . the first mode re@@ places the source Editor by the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the two @-@ window shares the editing window into two parts : the source code and the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor .
the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor works as follows : he invites you a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; -@@ page and a cursor . then you can edit and when needed to source code editor in which the changes in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor can be visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor on a document , which contains &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor . to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor , is continue to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor , is continue to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor . there is no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works exactly as the first , except that at the same time the changes in the source code as well as in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor will be visible and the cursor in the source code and in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is already active , the key@@ press of a window to others , whereby the position in the document is maintained .
the synchronization distance between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source code is adjustable via settings Qu@@ anta . after selection of V@@ PL ; -@@ View you can also choose between synchron@@ isation according to a click or automatically . in principle the recommendation : a small sp@@ anne for fast computer and a big sp@@ ice for slow .
supp@@ ose you want to change the title of the website , it is possible to select the title of the website , so the processing of invisible tags at work with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is also created , as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is created . this means the reduction of the susp@@ ended co@@ di@@ p .
Met@@ a @-@ tags lists the storage of information via the document itself . Met@@ a @-@ elements can be added by pressing the two buttons below . a click into the list allows modification of the contents , e.g. keywords on the column name and key@@ word key@@ word on the contents column .
CSS @-@ rules are the new way of design of the configuration of pages within the browser . you can add CSS @-@ rules with the buttons below to the list or delete . a change on the list is exactly as in the met@@ a @-@ elements . the processing of CSS @-@ rules are currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS @-@ style model by pressing on the file @-@ open button and select the appropriate file .
the use of the cursor is as in a text processing , possible with the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the short@@ cut appears as usual . text can be inserted as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ed or remove b@@ unk@@ ers .
the In@@ serted tags will be done in the same way through the tool@@ bar editor , as in the source Editor , made . it is to be noted that the In@@ serted tags in previously already existing identi@@ fying tags , e.g. if a an@@ chor day , surrounded with text , every other surrounding an@@ chor day will be removed .
some tool@@ bar such as the tables assistant or the lists assistant are disabled . you will be later in &amp; V@@ PL ; work , in this release you have to use tables or lists tool@@ bar .
&amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; is a tool for investigation of styl@@ ish@@ ings . in contrast to other programs for styl@@ ish@@ ings , the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the styl@@ istic situation can be prosec@@ uted .

on systems with installed read@@ line library you can switch from the arrow buttons on / from the load @-@ memory of the orders previously performed .
several commands require more than an argument . quot@@ es can be used to pass a compound expression than an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BAR _ @ quot ; &quot; as an argument is a holding @-@ point in a file called &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BAR _ @ quot ; .
template _ NA@@ ME : a valid name of a template , which consists only from the ASCII characters 0x@@ 00 to 0x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a fully qualified name like &quot; X@@ SL : tem@@ plat@@ e@@ Name . &quot;
fil@@ ename : a valid local fil@@ ename on the system of the user . on Uni@@ x@@ - or cy@@ g@@ win @-@ systems , the name may have the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; as short form for the personal folder . on RI@@ SC @-@ OS systems are also used more environmental variables .

there are many graphical tools to the same . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ use 3 ; ? let me explain why I wrote .
the inter@@ viewer was very complicated because one of the examples had corrected many changes at the same time . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result were numerous conflicts throughout the interaction .
that used by me , I only showed me the modified lines , but I could not see what exactly in this line had changed . and there was no evidence on the places where he may only be changed into action . the mer@@ ging of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
so this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; could display differences within one line and changes to white signs . later another lot of other useful functions were added .
if you want to compare for example quickly , simply copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and add it to one of the same window .
a function which made a lot of work was the same and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned into diff@@ use &amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; nearly in a fully worth@@ less file browser .
also 3 @-@ way inter@@ play will fully supported . this is useful when two people work independently of a piece of co@@ de and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to edit the outcome . in this editor lets you edit the result even directly . the scre@@ enshot shows three qu@@ ell files when connecting :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; helps you also perform at the same and mer@@ ging complete folder . this scre@@ enshot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; in the folder guide :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; displays the ex@@ hal@@ ted differences and causes the possibilities of current color monit@@ ors . if you often have to check Ko@@ de , you will like this feature .
differences in white signs and tab@@ ul@@ ators are visible visible . if lines differ only in a certain number of white signs , one can see a look at the summary in column on the left side . ( no hass@@ les ) if J@@ em@@ and the reg@@ ation changes . )
when a file is equal , and the other is different in a row then the color indicates that file is different . red color means that both can differ files .
if all files are the same name , but in different folders , then you can make yourself the Ti@@ p@@ par@@ ent@@ eit by simply complete the file name of the first file completely . example :
non @-@ diff@@ use 3 folder , folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder
the open dialog enables the manual and select file name , select the selection via the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting an most recently opened file from the list box . you do not need to specify the file for C ; if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of differences with two files will be done .
via the kno@@ b folder ... you can also select a folder , the duplic@@ ation or combination of folders will be selected , for B and C , but a folder , then used &amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; the fil@@ ename from A in the two other folders .
if you have crossed the input field , the input field for target is active and can be able to deal with it . however , it is not necessarily required to set up an output file . you can also get this step later in memory .
the setup button opens a dialog with settings . here you can specify options before you begin with the same / co@@ aches .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text compare . &amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; allows you to select text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . in the open dialog , you do not need to select files , you can close the dialog with the break @-@ button .
you can also use Zi@@ pped and distr@@ action : drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let him drop it over a comparison window .
what thought is behind ? sometimes a file contains e.g. several similar functions . if you want to find out how to create these functions , this would be a relatively large effort . you would need to compare two corresponding files , they in &amp; k@@ diff@@ use . now , you can simply copy the relevant sections simply copy , and then compare .
note : currently , you can draw nothing from &amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; only the exp@@ iry of text into a comparison window will be supported .
warning : some editors may interpre@@ t the accordion and deri@@ ves from text into another program as cut@@ out and insert ( instead of copying and in@@ ser@@ ting ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each text pane . the Info @-@ line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ ename and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( if the path to a file is too long , you leave the mouse a while on the line . then a small aid window will display the full name . )
the three source players are the letters A , B and C . a has the colour blue , B the colour green and C is Magenta . ( these preferences may be changed via the Sett@@ ings menu . )
if a difference is recognized , one sees on the colour , which file is different . if both are different files , the pres@@ et color is particularly useful when you compare three files . this is in the next section ( contex@@ ts ) .
links next to the text is the summar@@ izing column . if differences were found , the column indicates the corresponding color . when differences in white signs is not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + , e.g. are white character only in character chains and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in a few , rare individual cases . )
the vertical line that separates the table column from the text , where the respective source file has no lines . if the line @-@ file is not activated , the line is shown on the surrounding lines .
the result window ( under the same output ) also has a info @-@ line with the wording output : , the fil@@ ename and &#91; changed &#93; if you have been edited the result . usually it contains due to the automatic contex@@ ts already text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! to all conflicts dis@@ solved , is the storage disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons spr@@ ing@@ ed to the next cli@@ pped / un@@ resolved conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two compar@@ isons are used , each difference is also a conflict that has to be solved manually .
by clicking on the return column in one of the window , the first line of the group will be shown in all windows , and the first line of the group will not be visible . ) This group will then be the current group . it is highlighted with the color wallpapers for the current area and each of the left appears a black beams .
sometimes it remains to be left through the automatic contex@@ ts or select no further line in the group ; no line in the source ; it &apos;s only one note for the event that you can change your opinion and perhaps another source . this text does not appear in the final file , nor in a mark@@ ings that you might want to copy and elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; however , however , in the cli@@ p@@ board , however , in the cli@@ p@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . go carefully with this function .
note : if by selecting the sources the options ignore or Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments are enabled , changes in numbers or comments also be treated like white signs .
navig@@ ates mainly linked to the image and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard on the left , right , r@@ unter , side , r@@ unter , side , finish , r@@ g @-@ beginning and Str@@ g end , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . the over@@ hau@@ l column next to the vertical image bar can also be used either .
in the eye window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the in@@ ser@@ ting button , you can switch between in@@ add and over@@ write mode . ( pres@@ et is the in@@ ju@@ o@@ dus . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summar@@ izing columns synchroni@@ zes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group ( as already in the section and the edi@@ table window is explained ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( string er@@ up@@ ward ) or to the next / vor@@ ed conflict ( string er@@ up@@ ward ) or to the next / vor@@ ed conflict . therefore , it has to be solved automatically after the manual . therefore , it has to be distinguished between resol@@ ute and odd conflicts .
to copy the marking into the cli@@ p@@ board , you must copy the Cop@@ per -@@ Kn@@ opf ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or str@@ g @-@ in@@ ser@@ ting ) . if this is enabled , you automatically copy the manual automatically to the cli@@ p@@ board and the manual copying . be careful , as you could easily over@@ write the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board .
start @-@ end systems are stored according to the basic operating system . Unix @-@ versions use a line @-@ set @-@ character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems . \ r \ . K@@ Di@@ ff@@ 3 keeps the line application of source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; also not using bin@@ ary files .
the options and the list of last used files will be automatically saved and reco@@ vered in the next start . ( menu Adju@@ sting - &gt; K@@ Di@@ ff@@ 3 ) .
choose a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog displays the dialog with vari@@ ab@@ ler width to choose from , you should not use this but not . )
if you activate this option are differences in cur@@ si@@ ver script . if the chosen font does not support this presentation , does not happen at all .
in systems with just 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be shown . on these systems the kno@@ b set is automatically an odd color .
when this option is activated , when the switch of the tab@@ ulator button will be inserted in the appropriate number of spaces . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator is inserted .
when you enter or return , the entry of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line .
when this option is activated , each selection is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . the manual copy into the cli@@ p@@ board .
you can select which line type you prefer to save . the default value is the generally common selection on the used operating system .
while the compar@@ isons of files tries &amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; first , all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white signs can be ignored . in this step , white signs will not be ignored . even while the merger will not be ignored .
some editors ( in some systems ) save a w@@ agen@@ sti@@ re label &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , other again store only a new@@ line label &apos; \ &apos; . usually ignored . if this option is activated , but like a white sign . during the merger , this option must be disabled . during the pres@@ et this option is disabled .
in the default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis are numbers and related signs ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are still displayed , but they are treated as white signs .
in the default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated as changes in white signs .
intensive for even smaller differences . the option is activated in default . it is effective with complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files .
in the automatic mode , this attitude determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict is going forward .
resol@@ ves automatic all conflicts in white signs using the chosen file as a source . ( default is manual . ) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important . please note that the automatic selection also have conflicts in numbers or comments , if the options ignore or Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + -@@ comments are enabled .
these options are treated in the chapter on sc@@ anning of folders and perform a cl@@ apping . look for details under documentation to directory comparison and inter@@ viewer .
if a file is saved and already an older version exists , then the original version is attached to the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if already such a backup file is deleted with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup .
fits the language of the UI . the change of this option does not affect the current program . you need to finish &amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; ( this option is in the KDE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; not available because the language is set by global through the control center . )
the following enco@@ ding settings can be set for each entry separately . if you use this option , the above setting will be used for all entries .
for enco@@ ding fields for co@@ ding the co@@ ding appears a short note what the local co@@ ding is . ( this can not be changed here and has purely informal nature . )
adjust the file enco@@ ding for source files . that affects how special signs are treated and interpreted as the co@@ ding for each file can be individually adjusted , even files can be compared with different co@@ ding and combined .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which enco@@ ding is to be used .
if you define the processing machine , they might not work with your co@@ de@@ c . ( e.g. , your files can be 16 @-@ bit Unic@@ ode , but the pre @-@ machine error can be used only with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option one can specify the co@@ ding of the output of pre @-@ processing errors .
turn this off to supp@@ res@@ sions of changes in white characters in the text or over@@ view . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments , if the options ignore or Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + -@@ comments are activated . )
this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode , all the differences in a col@@ oured flo@@ ating column is shown . but sometimes you might just want to see the differences between two of three files . according to the selection of A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C is displayed next to the normal still a second over@@ s column with the required information .
sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen rather for long lines . you simply use the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sorts the compar@@ isons door to each other or over@@ other . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you consider the differences and then opt out to perform the files . a simple click starts . a simple click starts to start the merger and use the file name for the output file . ( if this function is used to start the assem@@ ble again , then the name of the last used will be maintained . )
when reading a file it will be transferred to the external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; then the output of the command will be visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ processor that you can cut your own preferences . you can use this function e.g. to cut distur@@ bing parts or to correct the re@@ tion .
when reading a file it is transferred to this external command first ( see above ) , then the output of the command will be used only when you start page . you can write your own preferences . each input row must have a corresponding edition line .
the idea behind it is to facilitate the user more flexibility when making the di@@ ff results . however , most users want to program the good program , however , most good news is not sufficient . the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l completely .
use this pre @-@ processing commands to convert the input into large letters : SED &apos;s / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; s . \ \ 1 in the default string . the \ \ U shi@@ fted the found text in big letters .
CV@@ S and other versions control system \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; before the $ is needed because $ a special sign and end of the line would mean .
while you experim@@ ent with sed experim@@ ent , you might start to understand it and perhaps like this regular expres@@ sions even . they are very useful because there are many programmes which can support very similar things .
the Ign@@ ati@@ fy of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Di@@ ff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of a further pre @-@ out de@@ pressed for lin@@ ec@@ t . sed &apos; s / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 67@@ 89.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each one is replaced by nothing , so practically deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several items on once . then you can use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from each other . example :
instead of sed sed , you can also use something different such as per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos; s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / Rest@@ ing / switches &apos; allergi@@ es are at per@@ l some details . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs per@@ l only ( and ) without the pres@@ et \ \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after normal Pre@@ processor will be kept for the display and the inter@@ play . further operations only changes the data that sees the start of the start of the line of Lag@@ o@@ grams .
note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the start @-@ processor is the output of the regular processor .
the processor commands may be very useful , but as with every function , the text changes or differences hidden , you may not notice certain differences and destroy in the worst case important data .
often , programmers to work in a folder many files . for this reason you can compare with &amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; complete folder re@@ ital@@ ic and merge .
... makes for each object a suggestion for the interaction ; you can adjust the suggestion before the start ,
... can sim@@ ulate the inter@@ sim@@ ulate and shows the sim@@ ulated changes without being carried out .
... performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 button ) , or just with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 button ) ,
this is the same and mer@@ ging of single files very similar . you just need to open folder on the command line or in dialog file .
when three folder will be mer@@ ged , then folder 1 as a base is used . if no target is specified , is used &amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; folder 3 ; folder 3 .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically start , do not start the mer@@ ging . to start the assem@@ bling , you must choose the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 button . ( more details follow . )
while the folder you read a small follow @-@ up windows about the current progress . if you cancel the sc@@ anning of the folder , only the files are listed , which are compared to that .
when the sc@@ anning of the folder is completed , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; a light window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and folder that was found during the scan will be displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is normally performed together . you can use a folder by clicking on the + / - or by clicking the arrow buttons for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions all sub@@ directories , and all sub@@ directories with which you can hold all the folder .
if you double click on a file , the file is started immediately and it appears a comparison window .
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
when the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detailed window to the selected object . in such a case the merger will be automatically selected . when the merger will be started , you will be informed about problems of this kind .
as shown in the above picture , the columns are used in the columns A / B / C the colours Red , Green , Yellow and Black .
in identical records , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folder are regarded as identical if your overall content is identical . then we also have folder the same color . with folders , age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colours reflect the colors of a leaf@@ let which is only green , then yellow will and later , when it is old , red becomes .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the goal if it exists )
... A and B identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the goal if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the goal if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if a folder and B is a file ) : error : contradic@@ tory data types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects may not be started .
... A and B did not have the same file type ( e.g. if a folder and B is a file ) : error : contradic@@ tory data types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects may not be started .
the mode for sync is active , if only two folder and no exp@@ on@@ ites target were specified , and if the option directories is active . then choose &amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; the needed action to be identical , so that both the folder are identical . if required for an entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical are : assem@@ ble and the result in both folders . ( the user can see only B ; directly after the merger , copies &amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; B to A. )
when two folder will be combined and the option reco@@ vered file instead of inter@@ ruption ( un@@ certain ) is then examined &amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; the date of files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the same date is identical , but the date is identical , but the date is identical .. such errors are not eliminated , the mer@@ ging of the folder will not be started .
while the mer@@ ging will result a file after the other di@@ st . you status column shows he@@ z@@ ure if the mer@@ ging was successful , and accordingly with other reports , if something un@@ expected came up . when the mer@@ ging has been completed , you should be a last review and check if the status is all right .
if the fil@@ tering method is selected , K@@ Di@@ ff@@ 3 additional columns will display . these contain the number of odd , bre@@ ed , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for comp@@ ose conflicts will be displayed only when three folder is compared or combined . )
you can either run the straight entry ( file or Od@@ our ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all contex@@ hr @-@ actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merger .
please note : if you don &apos;t have a destination folder , then will be used in the three @-@ folder mode C as a destination , in the two @-@ folder , will be chosen as destination and when synchroni@@ zing a A and / or B as a destination .
if you have chosen a destination , please check whether all entries will be displayed in the target structure , also in the folder structure . there are several options to be ski@@ pped through certain entries . check these options to avoid un@@ ami@@ able surprises :
to run all entries : select directory launch / continue in directory -@@ menu or press F@@ 7 ( the sc@@ anning range ) . to run only the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if any conf@@ lic@@ ting file @-@ file still exist , a message will appear on the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid promotion .
if you merge all entries , a dialog window will appear with the options , sim@@ ulate and break .
choose to see if you would like to see what would happen , without the real changes made . you will then get a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; then perform certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then opens a mer@@ ging window ( note the scre@@ enshot ) .
if you are finished with a file , you can proceed again directory or press F@@ 7 . if you still have not saved there , an appropriate dialogue . then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; his work with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; on a mistake it appears a message and detailed status @-@ information . at the end of the list you &apos;ll be able to try to ski@@ p the cause of the problem . if you choose to ski@@ p the cause you choose , or to rede@@ em the problem to solve another action for the entry or solve the problem in other ways before proc@@ eeding with the inter@@ ing .
if some entries were individually combined , mer@@ kt &amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; these entries ( in the current session ) and leads them in later , all entries are stored or not saved , these entries are considered to be done . only if you do the merger will change , these entries are again assembled .
the settings @-@ menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ Di@@ ff@@ 3 in@@ let ... ) has now a section called directory inter@@ play with these options :
only files that fit on the indicated patterns are displayed in the element tree . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid location : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folder must not correspond to this pattern .
files and folder that correspond to this pattern , are not displayed in the element tree ; you can use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as divi@@ ders . valid holder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folder that correspond to this pattern , are not displayed in the element tree ; you can use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as divi@@ ders . valid holder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that are also ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ mati@@ cally products are ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder can be adjusted with a .c@@ v@@ ign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / CV@@ S / c@@ v@@ ign@@ ore . )
in some files , files a Ver@@ sions are attri@@ bute . in other fil@@ esystem . this option allows you to decide whether these files are displayed in the el@@ ementary tree or not . this option is swit@@ ched in default .
when links to files : if the option is out@@ dated , symbo@@ lic short@@ cuts are compared . if the option is swit@@ ched , the files are compared to which the links show . this is in the default .
when links to folder : if the option is swit@@ ched , the links will be swit@@ ched as normal folder and recur@@ si@@ vely sear@@ ches . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ use ) . a link to a folder of a link to yourself would be displayed and &amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; ) This option is dep@@ rec@@ ated in the default .
performs a complete analysis of each file by and displays statistics columns , un@@ so@@ ber and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is s@@ lower than an easy bin@@ ary analysis , and much s@@ lower if they are used on files that does not contain any text . ( give an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folder over a long network , it might be compared faster , just the change date and the file size . however , you can use a certain level of security . please be used with caution . this option is in the default .
similar to tru@@ sting the chang@@ ement . there is no real comparison instead . the files are considered equally big . this can be useful when copying the change date . please be used with caution . this option is in the default .
activ@@ ates the synchroni@@ zing mode when two folder are compared and no target may be selected . in this mode , the proposals are identical to the merger , including the results of the mer@@ ging of files are stored in both folders . this option is stored in the default .
if there are differences , instead of the mer@@ ging the copy of the newer file as action . ( this is considered as uns@@ ure because it will not be modified that the other file has not been modified . you should be swit@@ ched in any case . ) This option is swit@@ ched in the default .
if a file or folder will be replaced or deleted , then the original backup copy and receives the original backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g -@@ enlargement already exists , this is also the normal mer@@ ging of individual files , not only the contex@@ ts folder . this option is swit@@ ched in the default .
normally the folder will remain visible ; you can switch the window bases with the mouse . if you do not want to switch the window directory with the mouse . if you do not want to switch the option List &amp; text windows share the main window in the window and switch off by changing between directory &amp; text windows between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ click . however , you can also launch a single file or run directly , without the folder file . once you save the result , the status will be put on done and the file will not be mer@@ ged once you start the folder comp@@ ress .
this status is however lost if you read the directory once again : directory -@@ menu : new to read
KDE supports network transparent with the help of KI@@ O @-@ sl@@ aves . K@@ Di@@ ff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folder for opening , which are on local or remote hosts .
the first command line contains a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line contains a folder within a compres@@ sed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as a local files and folder . some things should you consider :
a path can be relatively und@@ ly . or .. , which is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special sign must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , whit@@ esp@@ - &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example has a file with the name / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes connected by the protocol . it follows a brief list of constra@@ ints :
or it may not be differ@@ ed if a link indicates a file or folder . then one file is accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ftp : ) .
there is no way to edit , justi@@ fications or change date . therefore , the justi@@ fications or the change date from the original . ( note the option tru@@ sting the size . ) ( This is only available on local files . )
the main point of use is currently as differences @-@ spect@@ ator in K@@ Devel@@ op . K@@ Devel@@ op starts first always the built @-@ built differences , press K@@ Di@@ ff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the differences spect@@ ator and then select in K@@ Di@@ ff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
usually requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; two full input files . if it is used as a check@@ out file , takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; the names of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; the program patch can restore the missing file .
in the con@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ Di@@ ff@@ 3@@ Part . also , please note that this does not work if any of the original files exists . in addition , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since generating the patch file .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; as a part , it only supports the compar@@ isons of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . the mer@@ ging or the same of folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Di@@ ff@@ 2 ( now Hei@@ st there are comp@@ are ) there are already . in addition , the name K@@ Di@@ ff@@ 3 already indicates that it can be mer@@ ging like the program diff@@ use of the diff@@ usion tool collection .
I use GPL programs already very long and have learned a lot by taking into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all the programmers who have gone the way or they are going to go so .
you have compiled the program from the sources and the configure script probably not for@@ warded to the right pre@@ fix for KDE . in the default configure command in / usr / local , but then KDE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interface ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the READ@@ ME file you will find further information on this subject .
if only the number of white signs is different , these lines are treated as identical ; but if only a non @-@ white sign differently , the line is treated as not identical . if , lines of next to each other , this is is co@@ op@@ but this section .
the editor re@@ igns for each difference in the files where it starts and where he ends . that &apos;s necessary to resolve a conflict simply by clicking on the source code and execute the button A / B / C , and it is too much effort to design which this information could be saved .
the effort was so far too big . you can recover a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C . to process larger quantities of text should be used to use a different editor .
after removing text is suddenly lt : no src lin@@ ear@@ nest@@ les ; published and the text does not delete . what does this mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; use already many colors to highlight of differences . even more flo@@ ating would be conf@@ using and l@@ acks the purpose . use it to another editor .
many good ideas and trou@@ bles came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thanks !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; use &amp; KDE ; 3.1 or newer .
information on how to use K@@ Di@@ ff@@ 3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage .
a list of recent changes will be found under http : / / k@@ diff@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og , or in the file Ch@@ angel@@ og in the Qu@@ ell package .
to compile &amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; on one system with &amp; KDE ; to compile and install , use the following command in the basics of &amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; -@@ Distribution :
KDE @-@ yourself gives the folder in your system to be installed in the KDE . if you are uns@@ ure , you will find more details in the READ@@ ME file .
since &amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should have no trouble at comp@@ ili@@ ere . nevertheless difficulties occur , please report on the &amp; KDE ; -@@ mail@@ ing@@ lists .
cut ( Str@@ g @-@ X or re@@ mot@@ if ) copied into the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board at the current state @-@ position and re@@ placing the current mark@@ ings .
only differences in all folders are identical in all folders are not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the target folder .
( in the current version , you will need to re@@ read the folder to these options the folder with the function . )
there are only entries shown to identify the differences . this also performs so that identi@@ fier files can not be copied in the destination folder . if the target folder will not already be changed in the target process . ( the behavior is probably changed in a later program version . ) This option is out@@ dated in the default version .
note the buttons to choose from the source with the certificate A , B and C below the menu bar . if you are attached to one of the buttons below ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed at the button on the button .
in the default , this option is disabled . underground differences in each character ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white signs .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; displays a Mini@@ ature of all virtual working spaces . it is quite practical to change the current programs on the desktop to change their size , to finish or move it . this works both within a working area and at several times .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual desktop areas as well as the current applications . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop .
with the middle mouse button , window can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and other work@@ spaces .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; then click on an application within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and termin@@ ate the context menu and the name of the application as well as the entries minim@@ ize , maxim@@ ize , On the desktop and termin@@ ate the commands :
maxim@@ izing the application window on the full size of the desktop . appears only when on an application was cli@@ cked .
send the application to select virtual desktop . appears only when on an application was cli@@ cked .
is this proposal marked , you can move windows within the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button shi@@ fted on the desktop and also on other desktop .
if this field is attracted , are displayed in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the names of virtual working surfaces are shown .
cross @-@ crossing this field leaves the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers in virtual desktop can display . is it together with name show , the names are provided with folders , &amp; eg ; 1 . desktop .
if this field is attracted , the background of each desktop is also shown as a background in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ;
if this field is attracted , the current programs will be displayed as a small window at the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; other at the next time you will be shown only the empty spaces to make their selection .
here the view of the programmer window is selected . simply shows a simple rect@@ angles with the propor@@ tions of the program window . symbol symbol@@ ises the window with its standard symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real programmer . re@@ mark : Pix@@ map is recommended only for very fast systems .
here , the order of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; -@@ Haupt@@ f@@ enst@@ ers are determined : classi@@ cally safe &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in some other wind@@ ow@@ ers ; wa@@ ist shows all virtual desktop areas in some other wind management ; wa@@ ist in a vertical row , which is very good for the presentation side on the desktop .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager Mini@@ program in the inspection bar . it has the advantage that he can display in size , the windows can display as symbols or with its content and can move it outside the control bar .
right mouse button within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent evaluation of switch @-@ switch ... lets the dialog appear to appear .
at the moment , this cannot be changed in dialog settings . you can manually complete this :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or VI@@ C if you do not have to login as user interface or login to your system administrator . in this file you have to specify the key wind@@ ow@@ ders and to point this one value . possible values are :
da &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package base , you need a functioning installation of KDE @-@ package .

&amp; k@@ likes ; is a very powerful application that is constantly being expanded by new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ weak invo@@ ices .
if you prefer , a window appears as above . the main window of &amp; k@@ likes ; the enlarged window of the screen . in the following this window will be shown as an mag@@ nific@@ ation window .. The picture that is shown in the mag@@ nific@@ ation window , is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window .
in the default configuration , it might be enlarged ; the area around the mouse cursor is like a movable touch . alternatively , you can also arrange a select scre@@ ens in the larger window ( selection pane ) or the environment of the mouse cursor to the scre@@ enshot ( eg ; on the left screen ) .
would you to avoid that the mouse cursor is shown in the enlarged window , choose the mouse cursor . please note that &amp; k@@ may , is still not able to recognize the form of the mouse cursor . this is always the standard @-@ KDE ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse cursor .
in the selection mode , you can adapt the selection window to your own needs . you can change it with the arrow and the m@@ asts and change its size . this can be done in the following ways :
move the mouse cursor into the mag@@ nific@@ ation window and keep the left mouse button so you can get the contents of the mag@@ nific@@ ation code and move it . this also goes with the arrow buttons .
if you are in addition to the &amp; Shi@@ ft ; taste or use the &amp; M@@ MB ; use the drop window move .
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection window . please note that the upper left corner of the selection pane are firm and only to move the lower right corner .
&amp; k@@ likes ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , to copy into a file , to insert it later into other applications ( add it later to other applications ) , which rot@@ ate and much more .
starts or stops the update of the ad . the stops the required CPU @-@ time against 0 goes .
choose the actu@@ alization rate ( Very low , low , means , yo@@ ke , Very high ) . the higher the actu@@ alization rate , the more CPU @-@ time is required .
in this mode , a selection window will be shown . the selected area is displayed in a window .

none also known as &amp; k@@ mag@@ ni@@ fier ; is a scre@@ ening of screen . you can use &amp; k@@ mag@@ ni@@ fier ; to use a section of the screen to view the small printed screen in a newspaper or a photo . this application is for various people of benefit : from research che@@ ur or artists to the Web@@ designer or long@@ ing .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ uliert a mouse click when the mouse @-@ cursor is a while on the same place har@@ ps . it is intended to help people who suffer on R@@ SI @-@ Syndrome ( Rep@@ eti@@ tious syn@@ drome ) and those of each mouse click p@@ ains .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse cursor a while on the same place har@@ ps . it &apos;s meant to help people who suffer the Rep@@ eti@@ tious pen@@ al in@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syn@@ drome and those of each mouse click p@@ ains . besides , it can get the accordion with the mouse . this requires a little practice .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain , which can be caused by clicking the mouse , and helps to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may also use the pain that are associated with the use of your computer , you should have a doctor if this has not yet happen .
to make it even clear : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain , helps to create the mouse with the mouse , it is against pain that is caused by the move of the mouse , us@@ eless . and as with all the ergonomic ai@@ ds , the result can be unusual for each other .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is monitored your mouse and leads a mouse click away as soon as you break the movement short break .
is the intelligent de@@ pl@@ ating activ@@ ates , making &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after it is running the mouse button . move the mouse button until the end of the movement , you can run the drop of the left mouse button . the smart wear requires a little practice , but you get used quickly to it .
this verse time must be hidden after the end of the mouse @-@ movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click .
is intelligent cra@@ yon swit@@ ched , the turn@@ table shi@@ fter ( 1 / 10 s ) active . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after the descent of the mouse button is waiting , before it gets rid of the mouse , when the mouse is no obj@@ ection of the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports the clicking on the right and return , followed by a break , a click with the right mouse button . a hur@@ ried front turn left and return / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time will start , they can be changed but later .
if the sound is del@@ ayed , you can move &amp; KDE ; to find the response time . open the &amp; k@@ ating time . open the &amp; k@@ ating time . there is a sli@@ der sound @-@ Pu@@ ffer that you can set at a lower value to shor@@ ten the answer times .
if this setting is marked , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; this function is currently only available under &amp; KDE . this function is currently only available under &amp; KDE ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window
sets all settings back to the values that were adjusted when opening the dialog . have you already pushed the kno@@ b to apply the settings according to the last piece of use .
the best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; initially using the preferences . in particular , the smart wear should be swit@@ ched off at first . if you then click on the automatic mouse click , you can later take the smart wear .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to reduce the answers times by &amp; KDE ; in case of sounds .
first , you should be aware of what places a mouse click without effect : the Click on the neutral components of windows or on positions in the browser window that does not represent any link . you can park the mouse in such places until you want to use them again .
if your mouse ru@@ ck@@ ed , you should normally clean your mouse . this is usually pretty simple . the tri@@ ck is that you do not only clean the mouse ball @-@ clean , but also the roles , which come with the mouse ball in touch .
first , you have to take out the mouse ball . as that happens , is of mouse to mouse . it should be quickly clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have the ball , you would have to see the roles . these are on the sides of the Lo@@ ches into which the ball was used . the dirt and the dirt can easily scr@@ at@@ ched with a flat blade or the fingers .
in very rare situations the operating system breaks the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; when it &apos;s just started a move @-@ off . if you use in this case the smart for@@ et@@ ool means that the surgery is no longer by the slogan of the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; under another window manager and move a window .
the solution to this problem is that you run yourself a mouse click . here , the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; return and you can work as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to take mouse clicks and puts the cursor to another point .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor to the cursor where you want to have it . however , a hard drive of mouse clicks . so you can not cause any ke@@ yst@@ ory reactions . so , a hard drive for the mouse sho@@ cks are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bar and menus and the titles of windows .
I try to work with the smart car@@ ving , but I do not create it to edi@@ ts lyrics .
the intelligent de@@ pl@@ ating is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can deal with it . it &apos;s very well possible to insert it into the cli@@ p@@ board and to insert any other action on which you want to move into the cli@@ p@@ board . but it will probably have to prepare for once again . here are some advice to this :
use the smart for@@ warding not when you just start to start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; select text instead , lead you at an end of the text range , and keep the move mouse button while you move the mouse cursor to the other end of the text and then click the mouse button .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . thus , each time is compres@@ sed , when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; so you know exactly when at smart for@@ ging the shi@@ fting time . later you can use the intelligent delay even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but that requires some exercise .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Wind@@ ow ; it should be installed on most system already .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound@@ card and speaker and this correctly is set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; applied the mouse button as the mouse @-@ cursor is short @-@ har@@ ps . this program was developed for people who suffer on R@@ SI syn@@ drome and to which the actu@@ ation of the mo@@ sta@@ ing pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured so that a certain period of it is waiting for a period of time before the mouse button starts . in this way , the accordion can also be performed and deri@@ v@@ egen with the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program , with which st@@ um@@ my users can speak to their computer for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; you can let the computer speak to the computer for themselves . the user can select from a list with the convers@@ ing positions which should be discussed again .
on the first side of the assistant ( lin@@ kes scre@@ enshot ) enter the command one that will be used later for the voice of text . further details can be found in the description of the basic dial@@ ogs .
on the second page you choose the standard text editor . from the text requirements you can often choose text pass@@ ages without having to put it on . the text pass@@ ages can naturally be edited .
on the third page ( right scre@@ enshot ) determine the dictionary for the Wor@@ ter@@ ation . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the KDE documentation of the selected language to determine the frequency of individual words . additionally , you can use the word@@ list with an Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary , so you can only spell correctly words into the Wor@@ ker .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and contains essentially a rel@@ field for the ke@@ yst@@ re@@ tion of your pro@@ positions ( the lower white field in the scre@@ enshot ) and a foot@@ print of the already specified sent@@ ences ( the upper white field in the scre@@ enshot ) .
if you have k@@ mouth correctly , you can enter the input field the pro@@ positions which you want to hear . each sear@@ ch@@ anted set will be attached to the or@@ bit memory . you can select from these phr@@ ases which once again spoken .
with the menu item settings k@@ mouth / set ... open the settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; . this dialog box contains two card cards , voice @-@ range and attitudes , the page of Wor@@ ker and the page K@@ TT@@ SD @-@ language service .
in the entry field of the card details , enter the command to call the language generator . in the selection field below the input field you put the sign @-@ how with the text to the language generator will be given .
&amp; k@@ mouth , knows two ways to pass on the text . select the cross @-@ field when the text should be given as default as default to the language generator .
if the cross @-@ box is not selected , the text will be shared as parameters . you can use the following space :
of course , the command to address the language generator depends on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation to your language generator . examples of this command can be found in the App@@ endi@@ x .
with as possible as language service will use &amp; k@@ mouth ; as the first attempt to pass on the text to K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if that is successful , the other settings on this page has been completed and that is currently being developed in SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first exhau@@ st action after selecting a text passage , determine which action is triggered by the key@@ ring or by choosing a text passage in the menu text requirements or in the Lei@@ ste for text requirements .
with the selection of instant we speak the chosen text passage directly and in addition to the load @-@ mounted tank . with the selection of In the input field , the chosen text @-@ passage will be entered only into the input field .
with the second selection of the mach@@ ining of the mach@@ ining code , you can choose whether the text editor can be automatically saved in the closing of the mach@@ ining code .
with the selection of text pass@@ agen@@ buch , the book will be saved . if you choose changes , the text editor will not be saved . select before saving , is &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text message can be saved .
the page Wor@@ ter@@ gi@@ um contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries . in the main window , next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection range . with this selection , you can choose the date used to select the dictionary .
with the buttons on the side you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add the order of books or to export them into a file . below the list you can set the name and in the selection field the language for the dictionary .
choose for this source the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the &amp; KDE ; -@@ documentation is a . the frequency of individual words will simply be compared with ab@@ count of the insur@@ ation . in addition , you can compare the word@@ list with an Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary , to add only properly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries are assembled , and like this we@@ ighted .
with this option you place a new , empty dictionary without entries at . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; new one @-@ given words automatically adds to the dictionary , create a dictionary with your voc@@ abul@@ ary .
the main range of the window to the processing of text pass@@ ages is tender . in the upper part the text pass@@ agen@@ books are shown as a tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected record , you can change the text passage or the associated key@@ ring . if you have a text editor , you can only change its name .
actions like new text pass@@ ages or books add or selected text pass@@ ages and books you can either reach either via the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a drop @-@ down menu .
the order of text pass@@ ages or text pass@@ ages allow you to change by clicking with the mouse to the new place or with the arrow buttons and the &amp; old ; button .
the chosen text is cut off and copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if the input field is selected a text section , this is used , otherwise the selected areas of the publisher can be copied .
the chosen text is copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if the input field is selected a text section , this is used , otherwise the selected areas of the publisher can be copied .
the currently active proposition is spoken . if text is in the input field , this is used , otherwise the selected pro@@ positions of the verse .
if this menu is er@@ ased tool@@ bar , is a ver@@ able tool@@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands . the tool@@ bar can be arranged directly under the menu bar . by mouse click on the tor@@ tured left side and accordion can be moved the tool@@ bar to another point .
is this menu entry into the lower part of the main road with hints of the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; shown if not crossed , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu is er@@ ased entry , a simpli@@ fied unit for text @-@ pass@@ ages with entries is displayed by default on the mach@@ ining window directly under the tool@@ bar left and accordion can be moved the tool@@ bar to another point .
probably you have the command to address the language road not correct or not complete . open settings k@@ mouth ; set ... , open the page General settings and enter the command for the language training on the card details . ( see use dialog for voice syn@@ thesi@@ zer to further details . )
Festival is a language @-@ giving @-@ system of the University of Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and Wal@@ is@@ isch supported . the license allows you to use the festival free of charge and distribute it without any limitations .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice @-@ giving , is believed that festival in the folder / usr / local / festival is installed . the command to address the voice is then :
Free@@ TTS is a in &amp; Java . currently , he only supports the English language . currently , it only supports the English language . the license allows it to use Free@@ TTS for free and no restrictions to dis@@ semin@@ ate .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice , is believed that Free@@ TTS in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ ar is installed . the voice @-@ stop is possible with one of the three following commands :
for the third example , the option must be swit@@ ched as default file . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ TTS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of ph@@ on@@ emen in a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , therefore you need an extra program to dis@@ integrate the text in ph@@ on@@ eme . the license allows it , MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text in Ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the assu@@ mption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA in / usr / local / ha@@ di@@ fax and / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la are installed .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax is happy to be the last character of the text , making an extra sign adds . the full command is therefore more elabor@@ ate than in the other examples :
( Cat - ; echo ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / ha@@ di@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f / usr / local / mb@@ o / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ sh@@ ay / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written into a line . the option data as default file must be enabled .
the voice @-@ vote @-@ D@@ ä@@ mon by &amp; KDE ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; KDE ; -@@ further lingu@@ istic service . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . he uses modules to support different voice @-@ delivery systems .
since the setting of language generator only takes place in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only have to use as possible as language service as possible in &amp; k@@ mouth .
to setting the page K@@ TT@@ SD @-@ language service that appears in the scope dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successful to use , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; KDE ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , which depends on the individual of your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application with the people who cannot speak , text by the machine can be saved , text by the machine can be saved again , who can again leave the user again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no language syn@@ thesi@@ zer includes . on the computer must be a language syn@@ thesi@@ zer .

marriage You can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; you need to install program Spe@@ ech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher and set correctly . see also
when the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr or as long as long as no speaker is indicated , the card card will be shown . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the cart@@ ei@@ card will be shown above . see .
most TTS @-@ syn@@ thesi@@ zer offer different languages and voices , such as different male or feminine , or such that differ in volume or speed . you should also use several variations for a syn@@ thesi@@ zer . you should at least one speaker before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use the program speed @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise the standard speaker .
various actors for the same syn@@ thesi@@ zer are comparable with several printing money for the same printer .
if you click on the cardboard box speakers in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , the card card will appear . this will also automatically start when you are kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and still no speaker is set .
all already furnished speakers appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear above in the list . the top speaker is used for the voice , if a application does not exist .
select a mouse click a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
select a mouse click a speaker from the list and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
select a mouse click on the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list below . the order of the speaker in the list also determines its priority .
click on one of these buttons , to apply your changes to the running &amp; kt@@ ts ; -@@ System apply .
select a voting type , there are three male and three feminine voices as well as a j@@ um@@ - and girl@@ sa available to choose from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you click here , on the new speaker at the box card speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost use . go back to the card details ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so that the TTS @-@ service of &amp; KDE ; Start . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; click on the map orders to create text applications and manage text . see .
if you have at least one speaker , you can start the language output system of &amp; KDE . click on the box card information to open this box card . here you can adjust some general options .
select this an@@ arch@@ on to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; -@@ System , this start is successful , the cart@@ on@@ card orders ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . see this start @-@ card orders and you can read text agreements , and you can put text presentations , and the TTS @-@ system of &amp; KDE . de@@ activated .
when kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr ends , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; continue to activate the field of voice ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this clo@@ ister is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr will appear automatically in the system area of the inspection , it appears again , once the reading is complete .
with the buttons in this series you can start text applications , stop , hold and resume
with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; KDE , or read a text file for example . you can also switch the speaker for one job .
click on the file or OK , then all changed settings on all sides .
the ticket orders will only be shown when K@@ TT@@ SD started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the box and cru@@ el on the box ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; the web browser of &amp; KDE , you can read the text of the displayed page . highlight the text , the text should read , and select the text , the text should read , and select the text message . after a short time the language should start .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can also ski@@ p this step too , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ voltage lines and other invisible brands also pre@@ read .
in &amp; K@@ ate ; the enlarged text te@@ di@@ tor of &amp; KDE ; , you can read text here . highlight the text , the text should be read , and select the text , the text should read , and choose the voice to begin in the main menu .
this also works , if &amp; K@@ ate ; in other applications is embedded , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; qu@@ anta ;
K@@ not@@ fy is the correct system of &amp; KDE ; that you may be notified of you on the subject of events . you can also read the text of these messages also by &amp; kt@@ ts ;
in &amp; con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the I@@ RC program of &amp; KDE ; you can set different types of messages . you can set &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; for example , you can inform yourself when in a I@@ RC @-@ channel a message then you can read the I@@ RC @-@ news text .

filter for the drawing services offer a good option in &amp; kt@@ ts ; incorrect or faul@@ ty messages . the file c@@ mail@@ .@@ xml , is a good example . you remove the tags , and b out of the news , the K@@ mail ends , and also the expression / local / In@@ box , since this in most cases can be accepted as provided . read it too .
filters are one of the advanced features of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; are filters not required .
in filters , text will be edited , wo@@ e @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher to the program Spe@@ ech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . you are useful for improvement of the language to replace wrong language and abbrevi@@ ation , or to deal with certain short@@ com@@ ings of language syn@@ thesi@@ zer and their voices .
to understand the working method of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; Spe@@ ech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; with a text works . &amp; kt@@ ts ; diff@@ ers four types of texts .
the output of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it will be pre @-@ drawn to all other orders and keeps these jobs . if the output of the scre@@ enshot is read , the ass@@ ign@@ ing orders will be continued .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news like &amp; eg ; processor is priority . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be continued after the issu@@ ing of warning .
News have the nearest top priority . a message is subject to normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application to read messages . while you can read &amp; eg ; a long text on a website can read . &amp; KDE ; -@@ noti@@ fications are also news . read on this .
the rest are simple tex@@ ture . each order , which you encounter from the box card , is a text order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of applications , the text applications are intended for the output extended texts , which have no particular ur@@ gency .
all four orders are processed in qu@@ eue , except for the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application the output of a screen Re@@ aders , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such a pre @-@ reads , this issue is raised and ended .
first , you need to know that filter will never be applied to the output of Screen Re@@ aders . you will be applied to regular war@@ nings , messages and tex@@ ture and on &amp; KDE ; -@@ News .
filter the text and give it to the next filter . at the time there are three types of filters .
filters are executed as modules . in future there can be further kinds of filters .
cartoon re@@ plac@@ eable parts of a text by other text . however , you can specify either as words or as a regular expres@@ sions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; will be analy@@ sed by text or as regular expres@@ sions of messages from &amp; con@@ form@@ ation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better compreh@@ en@@ sible form .
&amp; XML ; -@@ envel@@ ope use a X@@ SLT @-@ file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format ; are some X@@ SLT files to the translation of &amp; XHTML ; in SS@@ ML .
with Spre@@ cher@@ op@@ tionally , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that send the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; if you have set the text on the cart@@ ei@@ ved speakers , you can read text from KDE @-@ news about it . Si@@ eh@@ s. read about it .
each of these various filters has con@@ stell@@ able rules for which he will be applied to a voice . if the filter determine that its rules don &apos;t exist , gives the text unchanged at the next filter next .
if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; KDE ; -@@ notification will be edited by all activated filters , which are arranged on the page below . the processing by filters is performed in the order from top to bottom .
this displays the list of the furnished normal filters . is a filter not covered , it is not activated and is not used . filters will be done from top to bottom .
click here to add a new filter . select the type of fil@@ ters , and it will be displayed further below .
for setting up a string tra@@ ilers , you have to enter a list of words or regular expres@@ sions . these patterns are found in the text , then the text is replaced in the corresponding replacement text . bill@@ ing and inf@@ ancy is not respected by comparison .
enter a name for your filter a name . you can choose any number , it only needs to be distinguished by the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expression . the filter cover the text with the string in column and re@@ places him in accordance with the character string and re@@ placing him in accordance with the character string . the list is shown in the sequence mentioned above down@@ wards .
click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expres@@ sions from a file that save the current list or delete a list from a file , the entries are attached from the file to the existing list .
here is a language registered , the filter will only be used when the speaker for the text order one of the here registered languages . click on the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages by clicking the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; button pressed .
is here a value registered , the filter is only applied if the text from one of the specified applications will come . you can type several programs separate by comm@@ a . example : Con@@ vers@@ ation , k@@ mail
the application @-@ ID @-@ run programs you will receive by the q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ bus ; -@@ Num@@ mern must you leave . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application @-@ ID kop@@ ete @-@ trial is allowed to enter it only .
the subscription fee will only be applied to the text , if all conditions associated with an entry in the box if all the input field is empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
in comparison of words used the string notes , regular expression in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must therefore be limited by partition signs )
in this manual you will find no instructions for writing of regular expres@@ sions . if you have the &amp; KDE ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular expres@@ sions and # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular expression &amp; # 160 ; regular expres@@ sions can be found in the package of deu@@ ces .
&amp; XML ; -@@ envel@@ ope translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SLT files from a format in another format . x@@ sl@@ t ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such surv@@ eys . it can be applied only to bl@@ iss XML . the au@@ xiliary Program of sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the environmental variable PAT@@ H is also x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
with the Spre@@ cher@@ op@@ tionally filter you can send texts to a specific speaker , which should be set on the box card , or set at a spok@@ es@@ person with certain characteristics . you can use for example that text from k@@ mail from a female voice should be read .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text on the filter exists , is looking for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected using the speaker properties , which sets the text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; be sent , and the properties of the card associated with Spe@@ aker filter , you can write the elected speaker .
is here a value registered , the filter is used if the text is installed on your system of &amp; KDE ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular expression , you can order these with a click on the button @-@ head to get help in input .
to obtain a faster processing , you should try the regular expression at the beginning of the string to an@@ chor , d. h. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
place here the properties of the desired microphone . if the text comp@@ lies the above mentioned filter terms , the speaker is selected to display the desired requirements at the bottom . click the button on the right to display the dialog box .
use this buttons to save your speaker settings or delete all settings .
the Spre@@ cher@@ selection filter will only be applied to the text , if all conditions apply with an entry in the box when you apply . you must have at least one condition .
the voice @-@ out API , from &amp; KDE ; to give the programmer their applications TTS @-@ capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD about &amp; D@@ bus ;
the K@@ TT@@ SD module system , with the language syn@@ thesi@@ zer to K@@ TT@@ SD can be added , so that syn@@ thesi@@ zer can use this syn@@ thesi@@ zer .

none of the named language syn@@ thesi@@ zer supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesi@@ zer for my language ?
I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ XML filter , but when using the module for Festival will not be read .
due to an error in the Festival ( beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice of Rab , thus SA@@ BLE does not work , so if you do not use this voice to read from websites . make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and found via the environmental variable PAT@@ H .
certain signs or unc@@ tu@@ ation marks seem to cause mistakes in syn@@ thesi@@ zer , so all pro@@ positions are sp@@ otted , or only Kau@@ r . what can I do against it ?
first , make sure that the option is set to the right value for the appropriate language . there are problems with certain signs or words , these may be fixed by a sign of a string filter . see .

the &quot; Spe@@ ech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; is used to extend a customizable module @-@ architecture for voice syn@@ thesi@@ zer . if you want to extend &amp; kt@@ ts ; for the use of another syn@@ thesi@@ zers to contact the team of developers .
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for supporting SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; -@@ conversion filter , but is not compul@@ sory . Debian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command ap@@ t @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to compile &amp; kt@@ ts ; you need a recent development environment from KDE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including the packages k@@ del@@ bs and the wr@@ apped files for the program &quot; Spe@@ ech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you have the source tex@@ te of &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source archiv for k@@ de@@ but to be downloaded , translate the program with the following commands , install and install the program with the following commands :
before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use first whether sp@@ ech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your language syn@@ thesi@@ zer correctly . you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ skri@@ pt SPD @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; KDE ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; that the program Spe@@ ech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is to be further developed . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is to be further developed and the script SPD is no longer needed .
a long text is dis@@ integr@@ ates in individual phr@@ ases . the user can use , or dis@@ able to repeat the output , or break down .
if an application text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; there can be an application of the preferred language for the issue . if you have a spok@@ es@@ person , whose language English and whose gender feminine is , it is automatically chosen by the best one speaker . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker el@@ ect you can see in .
if you click on the box card to Ad@@ ding , and therefore click on the map to edit the card set . as an example is shown below the setup of the module for the Festival Interactive . details of the modules can be found under .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable F@@ estiv@@ al@@ program . when the path is contained in PAT@@ H , you only need to enter festival .
select the subscription for text , which is handed over at the festival . for voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts ; are known to this setting automatically . generally speaking , eastern languages such as Czech or Slov@@ ak , ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders , speaker , Interphone speed and clay cast of synthe@@ tic language . if you cannot select some shelves and that one can be displayed , the voice does not be chosen by you chosen the voice of these settings .
some voices such as Multi@@ Sy@@ n votes need to be loaded by their size several seconds to be loaded , these voices are already loaded during the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so ( with maximum memory consumption ) the first sentence is syn@@ thesi@@ zed .
if this cross @-@ border can not be selected , you still have no speaker to apply ( or forget to apply ) . see .
is this proposal marked , will appear at the start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr . otherwise , after starting only the symbol of t@@ sm@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the programmer window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this cross @-@ section marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not work , it appears in the system field as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD a text appears . thus , you have the possibility to read it or otherwise control it .
here are all orders in the qu@@ eue performed along with the application that has adjusted the order , the number of pro@@ positions and the just edited set . the speaker ID corresponds to the column id on the box card .
with the buttons in this series you can use in the order that is selected in the list below or proceed . ( but not every order consists of several movements ) .
with a click on the OK all changes of settings ( also stored on the other cardboard cards ) and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr becomes a symbol in the system section . click on this icon to show the program window .
if the sound@@ system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead of AL@@ SA , G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the box card audio . see also .
here are only text entries and managed . expenditure of Screen read@@ ers , war@@ nings and messages are not shown . more information on the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .

if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de for the audio output will be used , you choose to install the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you have to install at least one module , select the PCM device . see also
Set the auto@@ speed here a . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % equivalent to half a half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % about the double normal microphone speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be installed .
click to apply the new settings for running &amp; kt@@ ts ; -@@ system to take over .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all the PCM devices and modules which are furnished in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out which device will work with you . in doubt you choose standard .
on this map , you can set special promotions that will always be executed if the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processed four types of language contracts :
the output of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it will be pre @-@ drawn to all other orders and keeps these jobs . after the issue of scre@@ enshot has been read , the ass@@ ign@@ ments shall be added again .
war@@ nings have the next time priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning keeps the issue of messages and normal text . these orders will continue after the warning of warning .
News have the next priority . a message breaks down normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application to read messages . if you are &amp; eg ; just a long text on a website you can read with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone can welcome the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or issue of a screen Re@@ aders , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audi@@ ts in the qu@@ eue .
this audio @-@ file will always be played if a normal text order is interrupted . if both intro@@ duc@@ tory sound as well as intro@@ duc@@ tory message is played before intro@@ duc@@ tory sound before intro@@ duc@@ tory message .
the settings on this map menu apply only for normal text applications . for messages , war@@ nings and the issues of Screen @-@ Read@@ ers , there are no special promotions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ not@@ fy messages , check @-@ t@@ sm@@ gr and click on noti@@ fications . the card messages will appear .
select this an@@ arch@@ on to switch the pre@@ read from &amp; KDE ; -@@ to turn off . this setting is not marked , the remaining settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads no noti@@ fications before .
this attitude marks , will be sub@@ mitt@@ edly , where a sound is played , by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not pre@@ read .
use these buttons to add events to list or delete it . if you click on the button button , appears a dialog , where you want to add the application and the event you want to add to list .
this event reads the message before the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sent when someone in a I@@ RC message was mentioned in nick@@ name .
all events , for which is not stated in the list , are of &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored .
use this selection field to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do If an event meets . you have the following choices :
if you have selected a user defined text , enter the desired text here . you can use the following sections :
you can enter the properties of the desired microphone . standard will select the speaker , who is displayed in the list on the box card as the super@@ ster entry . see this also .
notice that there are three levels of events there . if a specific event set for events is set . otherwise , the action for all other events of the particular application will be executed . as the last option the action is scheduled for t@@ ages that has been set under standard ( all other events ) .
the event All noti@@ fications for application standards ( all other events can not be deleted from the list . for this , you can commit the pres@@ cribe noti@@ fications as follows :
use the kno@@ b to save the settings for the noti@@ fications to a file . use the button to load stored settings from one file . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except all char@@ sets are deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for the control of voices , the volume , of gender voice and the tape . moreover , brands for the control of the arrangement of for example abbrevi@@ ation . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , a further W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently , SS@@ ML only supports part and only in basic functions . the following constra@@ ints are available :
you must install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( Bri@@ tical male ) as this is the default voice , the festival available in the output from SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or ton@@ ing in the Festival @-@ Con@@ figur@@ ative dialog does not stop at 100@@ n@@ bsp ; but the SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ ot@@ on .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and typ@@ ing filters ( SD@@ B filter ) . thus , the first set of synthe@@ ti@@ ci@@ zes , since only the first set of synthe@@ ti@@ zation must start , not the whole text order . there@@ with , you can also stop on the ticket orders either by or with@@ hold and break , even if the voice syn@@ thesi@@ zer this is not directly supported .
here you can see the typ@@ ing marg@@ inal filters . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; will automatically be set up . you can change its settings or add additional typ@@ ing filters , but let &apos;s get out of it .
most easi@@ est , you will learn the setup of the Spe@@ ech selection by means of try . place your spok@@ es@@ person online , change some features and check out how the selection of Spe@@ aker may have changed . so you need to have more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then quick@@ er can begin with reading , since only the first sentence has to be processed and not the whole tex@@ block , which can last very long ,
you can then keep an orders on the box card or cancel the card , even if the voice syn@@ thesi@@ zer this feature is not supported .
for these reasons the normal S@@ atz@@ en@@ omet@@ ri@@ fug@@ ation will automatically start when you are kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr to the first time . he cannot be removed , just remove nothing at this filter , unless you know what you do .
S@@ atz@@ en@@ erk@@ enn@@ ungs@@ filters compare text with a regular expression for stat@@ utes and add a sp@@ ul@@ ator sign ( dec@@ ul@@ ator ) before fil@@ tering automatically removed from the text ) . notice that the standard sign @-@ border filter filter the character sets .
S@@ BD @-@ filters will never be applied to &amp; KDE ; -@@ News ( oti@@ fy ) , war@@ nings , messages or issue of Screen @-@ Read@@ ers .
if you have removed from verse the normal typ@@ ing filters , you can insert it again by entering it in &amp; kt@@ ts ; enth@@ r@@ ene file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c .
on the map options , you can write the Spre@@ cher@@ ing for the application . the card map is displayed when
use of the standard speaker ( the chief on the cart@@ one card ) . in other words , there are no speaker properties .
use of the fitting Interphone , which indicates all the characteristics of the intercom function . if you choose the settings of the microphone or edit , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; these speakers shall el@@ ect &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker , which meets the original characteristics of the original characteristics .
select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the choices .
choose the characteristics of the desired microphone . if this property does not play a role , simply enter nothing .
select this section if the property should have priority over other properties . you can also set several mark@@ ers here .
since the language is a critical factor when entering the issue is , this property is rarely use . the only case , if you might want to specify this property . the only case , if you possibly want the attri@@ bute language , lies before you know that a certain application text in another language as being included in the working environment .
to use all properties in the area of speakers , the most important to delete , click the default speakers and then use the speaker , who corresponds to the following .
in this case , 0 is required for the last text contract in the qu@@ eue . you can also specify a order number ( without order number , input 0 required ) .
kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr immediately over@@ thre@@ w when it started . I used Deb@@ ug support , but I do not get any refund .
G@@ stre@@ amer is de@@ duc@@ ted and &amp; kt@@ ts ; probably you have to register G@@ stre@@ amer still register . at G@@ stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command G@@ ST @-@ register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not solved , maybe a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ stre@@ amer . you can attempt to update or un@@ install G@@ stre@@ amer .
the audio hand@@ over via AL@@ SA is not working when I play at the same time with another application music . if I have a text order , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ ts ; a message on the &amp; console ; appears a message , that is said : destroy to open PCM .
on your system there is the problem that conflicts in AL@@ SA occur that prevent a simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices . notes for possible solutions can be found on the website of the AL@@ SA @-@ Project ( d@@ mix ) on www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I have downloaded an additional voice for the festival from the internet . I have installed them and can use them in the festival , but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr will not show this voice .
add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / f@@ estiv@@ al@@ int / Vo@@ ices can serve you with the other entries . if that is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL that you have found the voice to have the developers .
on the map of the card audio there is a setting speed . so that this works , the program must be installed and installed via the ambient @-@ variable PAT@@ H . some syn@@ thesi@@ zer modules like the map coordinates a adjustment for speed on . depending on the chosen voice is this active or in@@ active .
the settings for the auto@@ speed are ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; pre@@ reads , SS@@ ML has own tags , with which the speed is controlled . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; by &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite mu@@ d , change the .@@ x@@ box file of &amp; HTML ; -@@ to @-@ SS@@ ML application , and put the intercom speed .
I am unable to read that web pages with a female voice . I have set a female festival @-@ speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the websites with a male voice .

I have added a dedicated character filter , and now I can go into &amp; kt@@ ts ; no longer use or go back . on the cart@@ on@@ ment orders will be displayed , the order shall be taken out of a set . what am I doing wrong ?
interval of the stand@@ point ( point , fru@@ ity mark , comp@@ iling , Kom@@ ma and Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ) you may not filter , use a filter for those characters instead .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ ating center ; which enables the management of network interfaces , which enables the network settings and the DNS settings .
the &amp; flo@@ ating center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and des@@ kt@@ op@@ tics on a uniform , integrated user interface . the &amp; k@@ contr@@ ab@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contr@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been developed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way , such as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ center ; create the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple surface for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module of network settings in the &amp; k@@ photo@@ l@@ center ; displayed . the module net@@ work@@ settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contr@@ asts ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; k@@ menu ;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware does not install . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured , thus &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device itself shows and the setting of network properties .
in most cases , drivers will be added for the network hardware and other devices when install &amp; Linux ; installed and set up networks later , the drivers must be loaded by adapting to the file , according to the kernel version :
the module network settings will be loaded when the option of network settings in the &amp; k@@ contr@@ asts ; -@@ Index is selected . when fil@@ ing the module , the platform used at the system is automatically recognis@@ able .
if the platform cannot be recognized , the susp@@ ended selection is offered . it is the platform from the list , selecting the distribution and the release reti@@ ring on the best way . by mark the setting cannot be taken once again . the next start of the network settings will then set the selection automatically .
the change of network settings is possible only in the system of governance mode . previously , all the options can be viewed , which means , the chang@@ er is not possible . in the system of system management mode by clicking the button in the lower end of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
in the system of management mode , the entire functionality of the module available . this is divided into three riders :
the rider network interfaces is used for managing the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the rider network interfaces , the following tasks can be performed :
the settings will be shown by selecting the desired device interface in the list and clicking the button @-@ end interface ... in the dialog box can be performed .
standard TCP / IP settings are available only for basic TCP / IP settings . click the button @-@ head Sett@@ ings displays the dialog with further possibilities .
with the selection automatic , the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched by a D@@ H@@ CP server or BOO@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system at any system start , therefore , no further setting can be required . in the output list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BOO@@ TP , according to the system selected .
the TCP / IP address can be made without D@@ H@@ CP or BOO@@ TP the TCP / IP address . in the input field IP address you must set the desired TCP / IP address . in the input field network mas@@ ke is the sub@@ networks .
is this setting marks , initi@@ alizes the system the network interface in the boats . if the initi@@ alisation does not wish to be activated , this option should not be activated .
the values specified in this dialog are shown as the properties of the device .
it should be assured that the IP address in the network would not be used . the input of an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP address . with ping in the &amp; console , you can notice whether the requested address is already in use . in doubt the network should be asked .
networks can be activated or swit@@ ched according to your needs . on a off @-@ off networking is done by selecting from the list and clicking on interface .
networking units can be activated or swit@@ ched according to your needs . the switch of a activated network is performed by selecting from the list and clicking on interface .
lays the IP address of the computer in the local sub@@ net , who convey@@ s the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with invo@@ ices in other sub@@ networks .
if the computer is available more than one network interface , the interface to the net is to be selected in which the gat@@ eway computer is selected .
a computer with DNS @-@ support is replaced a full domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computer only IP addresses can be understood . if the machine http : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org an@@ ires , does not solve this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 45.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the calcul@@ ator to the attri@@ bute part of the trav@@ eller list allows an easy management of this list . entries can be added , remove or changed des@@ den@@ .@@ DNS @-@ entries can be converted by selecting a single contract and up @-@ to @-@ classification in the list with the buttons , up or down in the priority .
by clicking the button to add ... from the group machine to the name , a DNS server can be added to a DNS server . it will add to the dialogue New Nam@@ es@@ er@@ ver .
first , you need to enter IP address of the DNS server and then click the button button . the entry will then be added in the list .
from the group machine to the nam@@ ing solution , select an entry and then click on the button Edit ... It will be shown the dialog .
the list of well @-@ known calcul@@ ator describes b@@ end IP addresses for TCP / IP Sub@@ system . it is used primarily at the boats , if no DNS server is available . in small , stored networks can replace it DNS @-@ Server .
normally , the list contains well @-@ known calcul@@ ators for some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this will still replace the latest version of IP to replace it in the future Version 4 .
enter the IP address of the known invo@@ ices and click Add to Add .... The dialog Neue Ali@@ as is displayed .
to enter the name of the known invo@@ ices and the Add @-@ Add button . if the known calcul@@ ator has several alias @-@ names , de kno@@ b Ad@@ ding several times and enter the other alias .
select an entry of a well @-@ known b@@ ush from the list and select Edit ... The dialog to edit computer is displayed .
it can be executed with one of the following tasks , then by clicking OK , the list of static hosts will be updated .
the settings made in the module net@@ worked settings are not effective in the system . to enable changes to activate changes in a &amp; console ; the following command must be set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is http : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of the bin@@ ary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) is to be installed if &amp; KDE ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is simply the rpm package and in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool can be used with graphic user as a package or the installation tool of your distribution .
in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; KDE is not necessary , but in addition , the development packages with libraries and other things are required .
this will only be experienced users . it is not difficult , &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; to compile . the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information on basic networks are given in the second , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; variable configuration files discussed .
this area can not replace more knowledge about IP networks . in this Annex you can only replace basic information on the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network .
currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never developed large spread . from IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected that it focuses on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is the note that IP address is authorized to use a network interface . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; workplace is the network administrator to the contact point , which can be used by a valid IP address . in any case , D@@ H@@ CP can not be chosen arbit@@ r@@ ary .
when put your own little ( home ) networks the IP address should be selected from a specially designed for this purpose to avoid IP address contacts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded , therefore its any use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be made possible by setting a gat@@ ew@@ ays .
smaller networks are mostly used in the range of 19@@ 2.@@ 168.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 168.@@ 1.@@ 254 x 19@@ 2.@@ 168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the network mas@@ ke is set mostly on 255.@@ 255.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so all your machines are included in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first one is the so @-@ called Standard route , the second is the Lo@@ op@@ back @-@ address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own computer ) . the standard route is required for IP re@@ direct@@ ing .
the mains address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in local own machine . normally the address is assigned to 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 an own so @-@ called Lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circle .
in this part there are the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file sometimes is dynam@@ ically changed at DSL connections , so that it was not surprised if in case of active DSL connections to find another content than specified there .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is random by scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another level as expected can therefore occur .

it appears the standard KDE @-@ KDE ; -@@ printing dialog . if you choose to fold , see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in print dialog .
prints the cr@@ ont@@ aneous of all users on the system . this option is only accessible for users to have extended discrimination .
cr@@ on , for example vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; use the command cr@@ ont@@ on to change the sched@@ ules of the users .

&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for Band@@ ages on the basis of t@@ ar . it offers the ability to create multiple archives on a tape . the first place was to provide a surface for t@@ ar to rest@@ ores the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ t@@ ar to the fast , sel@@ ective un@@ pack . the second goal was to answer a question , who made my wife : how much longer takes it to secure ?
before a band may be used , it must be of &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; sp@@ ult the band back and reads the pre @-@ thr@@ illing information of the ban@@ des . recogni@@ zes &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre@@ cip@@ itation on the band will not be asked if the band shall be form@@ att@@ ed .
recognis@@ es &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre@@ sp@@ ann , is looking for the appropriate index on your plate . can this not be found , you will be asked if the Band@@ index is to be created .
if everything went smoothly that the band is involved in the tape work , to view that the band is involved . in the status bar appears a corresponding message . the content of the player can now be sear@@ ches for the band .
before the throw of the ban@@ des , first of all , the integration must be resolved . there are three methods to achieve this .
&amp; k@@ dat ; indicates a change of the symbols for the band that the involvement of the band has been resolved and indicates the status bar . the band can now be extended without any risk .
before a band of &amp; k@@ dat ; be used , it must be form@@ att@@ ed by &amp; k@@ dat ;
a Band@@ ana must be form@@ att@@ ed before you can &apos;t use this process . this process corresponds to the form@@ atting when using &amp; k@@ dat ; it has to be done before you can form the band of &amp; k@@ dat ; can be form@@ att@@ ed by the tape of &amp; k@@ dat . flo@@ ppy disks are usually not a form@@ atting of the ban@@ des ahead , DAT @-@ drives , however not .
after entering the band@@ name and the capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ atting of the gang . all data on the tape will be lost ! after completion of form@@ atting , the band will be integrated automatically and is ready to use .
before you encounter the backup process , you need to select the securing files . this can be done on three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it is only saved to this file or folder .
select a backup profile in the tree . it will only be backed the files specified in the profile .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the so marked file and / or sub@@ folder are backed up .
click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select to the menu Se@@ ats ...
once the backup has been initiated , the dialog opens up for backup . in this dialog , you can even examine the selected files and change the settings for backup .
if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog will appear . the dialog displays the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in an der Archive in the entry for the drive . it will be tested only the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a tick . it will only be tested the selected files and / or sub@@ folder .
click with right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu item ....
once the test process was started , the dialog will appear for verification . in this dialog you can even check your selection and change the work folder for the review .
when you confirm the settings for the review , the dialog appears to verify . this dialog displays the progress of the test process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time .
before you can direct the re@@ produce , the files must be restored , the files will be checked , highlighted . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives , which belong to the entry for the band@@ age . it will be restored only the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the desired files from one of the archives with a tick . there are only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder .
click with right mouse button on a file or folder in one of the archives and select menu .
once the recovery process started , the dialog will appear for rest@@ oring . in this dialog you can even check your selection and change the work folder for the recovery .
if you have confirmed the settings for the recovery , the dialogue will appear re@@ produce . this dialog displays the progress of the re @-@ creation , as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time .
sometimes it proves to be used as necessary to create the Band@@ ing file from the band &apos;s contents . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can re@@ create the index on two types of volume :
here is a backup profile with the straight selected files and default settings . you can make use of the following settings :
the current working folder where the backup is to be done . the list of corresponding files will be updated automatically according to the selected working folder .
for all folder that are listed under hed@@ ging files , which are only stored on the same file system , such as the folder . folder that are installed on other file systems , you can use separately below backup files . each entry is viewed by t@@ ar independently from the other .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files are changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a sn@@ apshot file will be secured . it will only be backed the files that have been changed since then .
the name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the sn@@ apshot file before the call of t@@ ar . this causes that all files will be backed up and a new sn@@ apshot file is set up for the next backup .
the functionality of buttons files &amp; gt ; and lt ; and lt ; files was not completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings can set you via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Sett@@ ings Sett@@ ings . the following settings can be made :
the full path to the device _ device ( usually / dev / T@@ ape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ vocation version of the band .
is this setting actively , transm@@ it@@ ated &amp; k@@ dat ; before the band is integrated the command to load to the drive . in some drives this is necessary before reading or re@@ oper@@ ations .
is the option swit@@ ched , try &amp; k@@ dat ; to un@@ lock the throw in the Band@@ ages . possibly this attitude does not work with all the Band@@ ages .
if the option is swit@@ ched , is automatically rejected by dis@@ solving the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically use this option not in Flo@@ ppy stre@@ ams .
is the option swit@@ ched , try &amp; k@@ dat ; the hard@@ war@@ n block@@ age for the band@@ age force . no matter if this setting is active or not , you need to be &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block@@ age for your band@@ age .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band form@@ att@@ ed , it writes a file to the beginning of the player . this file should only be b@@ yp@@ ad on the tape . the contents of the file is composed as follows :
( N bytes ) The band @-@ ID . the format of this character is invo@@ icing : seconds , with invo@@ icing the full name of the system is , on which the band was form@@ att@@ ed . seconds is the number that has passed since the epoch in which the band has been form@@ att@@ ed .
the band @-@ ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HOME / .@@ k@@ dat .
the remaining files on the tape are pure t@@ ar -@@ archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - t@@ ar . even other t@@ ar versions should work , as long as it is not about incre@@ mental f@@ uses .
check the contents of a hed@@ ging . this symbol is only active if a band is integrated .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; KDE ; -@@ vie@@ wers for system prot@@ oc@@ ols . the program is available for un@@ experienced users where you can obtain information about your system or where the system allows for example to access information about problems that appear on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users to understand what your computer is in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simpli@@ fied representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users where you can obtain information about your system or where the system matches the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users the fast access to information about problems that appear on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore tries to provide some advanced functions , with their help the protocol files of certain programs can be fil@@ tered and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 features &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of sy@@ s@@ log server and for Sam@@ ba
many other features are also included in addition and will be explained in the further cap@@ tions of this hand@@ book .
as you see in the following scre@@ enshot , presents &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions at your disposal , with their help , the individual protocol lines of a protocol @-@ file can easily fil@@ tering and sort out the individual possibilities to s@@ orting and filters will be shown in the next chapter of this hand@@ book .
after the start , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first started the most important protocol @-@ file system - the system prot@@ oc@@ oll - this will not be displayed , and it opens up instead of its a small post @-@ system windows . the protocol files can be found under Linux normally in the folder / var / log , for the normal user usually no permission to read .
you can also use the fil@@ tering option to filter after a selected crit@@ erion . the list of log files will be displayed automatically . in the default configuration contains the selection range next to the filter the entry . then there will be a protocol @-@ line only displayed in one of the columns of the filter pattern .
you can of course choose another entry at this point . select the character string . select the column process in accordance with selected column , and carry it in the fil@@ tering the name of a process , so shows you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all the protocol lines which have been sent or created by this process .
this option is activated in the default configuration and helps you to detect the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are shown with a striking lig@@ ent colour as a protocol lines of the Level note . the colored representation of protocol @-@ lines can be folded .
would you like to show a certain process ( e.g. in the system prot@@ oc@@ oll or in the Cr@@ on protocol ) , so you can hide the process @-@ identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can be useful for example if you would like to examine the output of a certain commands , such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case you use the fil@@ ename .
in addition , you can jump the option to display new lines in the context menu of the main menu to show all new in the next record lines .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows you to use multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open extra windows and manage your window , select a protocol to display .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on http : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ soft@@ war@@ e.@@ org@@ . D@@ ort you will find more information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; you can also find in the following folder of &amp; KDE ; -@@ Subversion Archives : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; KDE ; -@@ Archive
welcome to the &amp; KDE ; System V in@@ it editor , rather well known ( and in the following also as named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ sv ; . this section leads to a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ sv .
the system V in@@ it develops rapidly to the standard for the control of the program rest@@ arts when up@@ take the system in the &amp; Linux ; and therefore , because it is easier to use , powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it .
I will not go on to historical aspects ( e.g. because I know nothing : - ) .
the in@@ it @-@ bin@@ ary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important , because maybe someone might try to adjust a machine to System V in@@ it without a new installation and re@@ form@@ atting . therefore , you need to be saf@@ es that the old in@@ it was removed from there when there was there one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V in@@ it also diff@@ ers from the BSD in@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder from / etc are instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ d. D@@ ort you can find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folder :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . generally you need a script for each system service , you do not include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; mail@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; System@@ services do not include such things such as set@@ serial , which will only be started . such views belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local it should lie under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems possess this file , even though there is not much use for it . you can also want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run out something , which has to do with the serial connection .
the kernel is looking for different positions of the program in@@ it and starts the first one that he finds .
the standard Run@@ time is in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see in the initial range as the following :
at this point you can take a look at the second column and probably notice that the pres@@ et Run@@ time 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can perform / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab from hand and adjust the 3 . be very careful when you have to execute the system , running the system rest@@ art and execute the following :
but how does all the right scripts do you enter into r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that in this folder does not find the right files . instead , each entry here is a link to a scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how starts and stops in@@ it actually system services ? very simple : any of the scripts is so written that there are an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts actually from hand on the command line :
this would keep the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one K includes , the script will be called to the argument stop . if it includes an S , the script will start with the argument .
some people wish you a simple way to set machines for many purposes . I could have &amp; eg ; a server -@@ Run@@ time , which can be run only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; ap@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . in addition , I could also have a user @-@ Run@@ time , the &amp; G ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc .
here you will learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ dra ; . it should not be very difficult because the program has been created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ sv ; with a mouse or another po@@ inter is easy to do not say tri@@ vi@@ al : move an entry from the range of the availability system services at one of the six Run@@ time to start it on this level ( or to stop ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ lev@@ les or change the position within one level by moving it . thereby , the entry of its original Run@@ time ( or its position ) will only do when they draw an entry out of the area of the availability system services .
note : entries are shi@@ fted , if you select it in a new area . to select it simply to select a new Run@@ time or from the context menu , and in the target area , -- even then if the same entry has already exists in the target area .
the s@@ orting number of an application can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case you have to edit the s@@ orting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can attempt to insert the system service .
note : currently there is no way to restore entries in the tr@@ ash or thrown in the tr@@ ash . be careful .
you can use the Tab@@ ulator button to enable the different fields of work ( availability system , Run@@ time 1 stop , Run@@ time 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor buttons to meet a selection of top or below the previous .
to move an entry to another Run@@ time ( you can also move it with cut off into cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired Run@@ time with in@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the s@@ orting number or the name of a contract manually , press the button button to switch the properties dialog . connect the table button to switch between different fields . connect the dialog by sending the button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to dism@@ iss the changes .
because of the risk of the data required , all entries in the menu file require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . performances , the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) . otherwise they will be saved by &amp; k@@ sy@@ sv ; re@@ produced . changes to the preferences are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ ners , and now the machine starts again new . what can I do ?
enter at the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t l@@ inux single and press the input button to start in individual user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the standard Run@@ time at a reasonable value ( 3 should usually be in order ) .
I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ sv ; for execution under Run@@ time X , but they are not executed .
if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , then you have to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the way , such as system services can be started in these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ sv ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution : check if all configuration files are required ( and even if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) are simply without a message when their configuration files are not provided or wrong .
the importance of &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , may even be different from version to version . if you use a different distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ time , so that this manual can be added .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the user and groups of your system .
to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; start it is sufficient , the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
once you have made changes , you need to save it . either you use the appropriate icon of the tool@@ bar or the entry store in the menu file .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two card maps , the user and the user reviews . to edit the desired users or the desired group with a double @-@ click on the entry . it appears the dialog user and group properties .
some card cards are shown only if you have extended system settings , if you have extended system settings , on which you can make individual settings , if shad@@ ow , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d like in BSD / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d .
the card @-@ card management appears , if shad@@ ow , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as in BSD -@@ Uni@@ x@@ es are installed .
this card @-@ card appears only if for at least an embedded fil@@ esystem ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized is ( recogni@@ z@@ able at the file quot@@ i@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here you can be modified for each user parameters , whereby the restrictions are stored in KB as follows :
these parameters can be individually adjusted for each file system . the current file system is selected using the field of fil@@ esystem .
the card details inform@@ s groups informed about the group members of the selected users . the standard group , to which the user belongs , you can find in the primary primary group . furthermore , the user can be member in other groups by using these in the large field .
the dialog features of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or a group , select Ad@@ ding from the menu users or group or click the fitting Ad@@ ding button . the Edit or del@@ e@@ tion of the selected users or the selected group works similar .
with this module you can install the LI@@ LO @-@ Boot@@ manager , remove the boot@@ pass@@ wort , remove the time until the boats of the standard operating system , remove the default operating system , remove operating systems , remove , change and more .
