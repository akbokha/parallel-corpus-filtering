<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can quickly be found in one year times at the same place. if you have enough photos, then you will use sub-folder as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; use. then a folder for pictures you print or publish on a web page.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements like sealing of the photos, archiving, workflows, workflows from pictures to different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years, 95% Archive and 5% of work files and you will then be able to organize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">Which types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes the stacking processing easier. separate new of old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and labour files are simplified a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you search for an original or an expied picture.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the option metadata option in the addition of metadata in & digicame; it is certain that Exifying and IPTC data into the file will be written, then you can reaffirming the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the corresponding item in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change? it represents & digidered; giving them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Well, the real work begins, since you choose to select any photo keywords, indicative and a review. of course, you can select all images that need the same attribute and set the value then. you start the best with the rating or the leaderect. this makes sense, since you can concentrate on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us now connect with keywords, keyword, as you are often called in other programs, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">When deciding import images from another source with built-in keywords, then will automatically insert the images to the right place. the sorting of the Hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can simply be done through the pull of a building to another. the changed keywords will be pursued by & digiv; updated during the sub-trees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata. this is a very large representation since each block of metadata in truth consists of many sections. filename and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough the keywords - the next section refers to confessions or comments, the third important tool to cataloging your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You just want to see most nobody to see your photos just, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. they are sure to see how your photos arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Take a look at this panorama. from afar is not even a nice beach. if you look at it nearer, then start to see some details, people, the square.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you that of the Landesquare of the Allies & quot; in the French Normandie 60 years after landing. Wow! you start to dream, associations, the historical time period is again present, you may perhaps even hear the silence. the lettering has completely changed your perception of this panorama.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who view your photos may be more important than the picture itself to create an interest. remember, the key is to transfer a story. remember to help Him about the motive that you moves it to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is in order if an image is not perfect when it has the strength just to work with a certificate for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digicame, you can also export a lot of text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), then you can even add it to a selection of images at the same time. KDE will give you even a rectangle drive to your wishes in the certificate and / or the title of the Web-gallery system. you have to tell the story so for the opening of the Web-gallery for a second time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? as you had to find in another city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet at GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures, the train of the spatial presentation is now available with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of Geolocation increases are already recommended and will be able to open in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can also export your trips with google Earth. you can also export the photos at Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; by GoogleMaps-Viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a wording of copyright and means to use the copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, so also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information contained in the correct page of & digicame; as information should be deposited:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for Sustainer and authors): this field should be called the photographer, e.g. to protect the photographer of the photographer, for example, the name of a company or organization can be used. after which this value it should not be changed. this field does not support compressor even semikolons as dividers.</seg>
<seg id="173">Authorittitles (synonym for Vergestions): linked to the author. examples of this field contains the work designation of the photographer. examples for this subject can be title, freelementary photographer or incommercial photographer. as this is a reference to the author, it must be filled out as well.</seg>
<seg id="174">Editor (synonym for providers): use the provider of providers to identify who you have not necessarily be the author. if the photographer's work can be listed here, which you can offer the picture to others. if the image is a warehouse, then here the group / Agency will offer the picture here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, even though this has no protection against abuse. each of the solution for this problem is digital watermarks, delete or change. the solution for this issue is digital watermark. for individuals, this protection is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and Half professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is per image unique. & digicame, will be available in the near future such a module for the forklifts.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: record, sheet size, ECC, transmission error, ageing the storage media, recovery, redundancy, life-time, life, temperature size, common anterbelieve</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course, we do not talk about CDs coming on the street or a brand. these kinds of Verlusten are the same that you can happen to traditional paperphotos or negatives. in this section it comes to problems with the so called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the biggest data recovery company in the world, has some interesting statistics, which has a data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight the problem at CDs / DVDs, you have to be treated more and more expensive more than a couple of years. of course you can also get CDs and DVDs in Archivative. of course you can also get more expensive and much more expensive. there are offerings over Gold Coated DVDs, & dollars; 2 the play the one life time of 100 years for himself. whether you believe it is in your messenger game.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be inreadable, but you can use this risk in which you get good Disks and good recording counters are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write a lot of reliable. it turns it to the right now.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors, even if you have just been written. it is only effective data, the rest we needed for formatting and the control system. despite this massive protection they through chemical aging, Ultrapurple light, scratch, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For faulty CDs and DVDs there is a favorable program called the IsoBuster which does seem to work with CDs and DVDs. it also does not work for Macs. there are also similar applications that corrupt data from corrupted floppies, hard-media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray Disks seem to win the Formatwar against the HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost sixty the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8,5 GB. everything which was said to CDs and DVDs are also applicable to the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slow with a good recording fee on high quality media in a non-proprietary format. also, you can copy the media with a description, date and author-mark and before animals protected site. forget the latest piece of hardware or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disvehicle retain your statistics for themselves. their manufacturing guaranteed include a new disc, but not the data. Google provides a large fieldstep on the error mechanisms of hard disks: diserrors</seg>
<seg id="187">In brief: Disks hold most of the longest when you are in the tempered range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. at lower tempered errors, SMART can't determine these bugs. some of SMART fixed bugs. these are in particular readings and relational ometer. the expected life-time period is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only about the complete process due to over voltage output. of course, you can also have data loss due to a power if you have saved the files, but these losses can normally be produced without great problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices power staves does not see much, that may take severe damage. on your computer you can cause serious loss, harddesign, destroying motherboards, breakdown motherboards and other deficit. describe yourself from the inavoidable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against electricity points is a super-voltage protection. this is a device that some of the energy-jokes absorbed and the rest det. it is usually available in the form of a plug-bar. but remember that not every plug-in-bar is also included.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for a over-date protection, then you should pay attention to the UL product standard. this guarantees a specific minimum of protection. you should also be careful when it protects against flash and thus protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since a more voltage of each cable can use to your computer, you should also be connected to all the periphering tools that can also be connected to your system. some manufacturers will also provide one telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection possibilities for the coaxial cable of the cable modems and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, then you will need a portable voltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially designed for notebooks and therefore also contain the protection for the modem. so you are ideal for travel.</seg>
<seg id="194">While a Overvoltage protection your system protects your system from smaller variations in the electricity instructions, it will not really help you to loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in a subbreaking-free power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">Besides the protection from Overvoltage these devices can automatically provide cordless energy, when a electricity comes into account. some models allow them to continue working. if you buy a USV and then you should be sure that they met the same quality requirements as a super-voltage protection. in addition, the life-time of the battery and the included software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Concerns the potential risk to suspended your computer system and compare its security in electricity disorders that you need up to & euro; 20 cost, A 500W USV can be used for less than & euro; 40. this is only a small price. to you think you should always remember all cables before you go to holidays.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web-Service contains S3 Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration you can use this as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amounts of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are compared to the hard disks, but very expensive - 40 GB expenses & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB expenses & dollars; 500. in addition, you must send the data about the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures. it is not about a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution. for it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the Photo-Community 23hq.com make online storage services available on 1 GB and you will not have your pictures in full resolution online. the professional variant provides you more available, in case of Flickr dramatic more. for 25 $per year you will get unlimited memory, which should be checked in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of the data backup, the web-solutions are very safe. transmission error thanks to the TCP protocol and with the big companies is included in the offer a backup and a shared memory.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrate the elements of the transmission chain in calculator. all transmission are susceptible to transmission errors. the filesystem zFS and btrfs are at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst comes to you that no one says when a transmission error has occurred, not when this happened in your hardware. it's pretty disturbing that it should not give it to your computer. nobody seems to have thought to have. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much more secure drive than that of your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable network parts are a further source of transmission of transmission, because they produce intermitting within the data currents. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be bothered by two candidates who can deal with turnout on lower level and is available under one to the GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon also be available for Linux; and Windows. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has started his own initiative with its btrance filesystem. this is still used in the Alpha status. it uses the same protective mechanisms by ZFS and is also available for Linux; but it is not part of the core.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this both factors for 86% of data transfer at notebook and 46% in the workbook systems. in notebooks, the percentage of the theft.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than the chisel. it leads to a lesser damage, as such as theft. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users know only very few viruses and under & Linux; has long been no longer been sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss than proprietary systems: false, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to call the spread file systems. a very good English article can be found here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journent-file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: false, only the speed of the investigating action during an operation is higher and an indefinately status will be avoided before the problem appeared, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: false, theft and human mistakes are the main interests of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 blocks of fundamental physical limits. common is that while the technology is further developed there is a natural border for these progress. sensitivity and careers for all kinds of Lials are no longer far away.</seg>
<seg id="214">"" "" "" "today's cameras will go down towards the 10 megapiece and the end of high-quality optics. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixel. for higher resolution you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard disk get you today for 100 & euro; so do not get any other for data transfer. 6% of all PCs are often affected by a plan and test this backup before you make something like the reinstallation of your operating system to make the exchange of plates or the size of hard disks.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose any daily your fuses on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a flash proposes that you are lucky when the drive has not been connected.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster poses locally and destroyed a lot. forget airplane: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough. they usually concern one whole room or the complete house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, desasterprevention is always a not local storage. bring your fuses the stairs up to the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of the physical separation: as above mentioned is another reason for a data loss in spite of safeguarding the panic. if you have a backup the not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files will be backed up. it is a snapshot of moments without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differences: backup of the files have been changed since the last complete data. generates a complete moments of up to two time points: the complete protection and the last differences.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files have been changed since the last backup. you can restore the original status at any time. this backup comes with a sealing system at the next with the exception that it is only abstastet and not continuously.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily create on your machines. in contrast to script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file-transferring scripts, simply copies the difference of the files that really changed. this happens compressed, and if you want to increase security about ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure important pictures directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or another optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure lets you discover enough time to uncover losses and restore. at the same time, you get a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly moments for at least one month and a moments for each month. any further expression should be manually after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Themes: metadata, in the image file stored IPTC Information, associated XMP files, original, scalability, media, reinvent of pictures and metadata, copy the pictures to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visual equipment,..., use of the internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">To ensure valuable images the next 40 year, that is about the time period in which you are really interested in you, because they should remember your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be respected:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future because of your nature is unpredictable you have to look at everything today. unfortunately, there is no other option than to have some vigilance. unfortunately, all 5-8 years, you should ask yourself as the current system backward is compatible. the less variants you have in the past, it is easier to assess the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered with the explanations in this document. use or change the open standards which are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available today. if you have an old system that is important to reading your images, then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: every time you change your machine architecture, your memory and security technology, you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard. stay in open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the agent for the possibility to change a system in its size. this means always to enlarge.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's take a time that you have planned the scalability with and in the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated record or partition. at * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and overlay the files on a new plate:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg whether your new record was recognised by the system, but hang it not.</seg>
<seg id="235">& Tag; dd, = / dev / sdb / sdb / sdb / sdb; parted ressing / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the plate in MBs; # works with ext2.3, fat16, 32 and ReiserFS; resize2fs / dev / sad c1 # change the size of ReiserFS if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no software to read it, then you can create it. this task will become easier from year to year easier.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietor, patented format that slowly disappear from the market. you should therefore no longer use it.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG was developed as an open source standard developed by GIF. it can be fun-free, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per colors and full transparency. PNG can require relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF and has a slow compression. this format we want to recommend you to save your images.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as a image format. TIFF can be saved in uncompressed form or in a container with a verfunny free compression salty. a problem is however that this format is adapted by many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The digal Negative file format is a licensed free and open paper format that has been developed by Adobe Systems. DNG has been developed on the TIFF / EP format and is obliged to use metadata for DNG already and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon it again sometime.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why to replace the Adobe its XML based XMP technology; a mixture of XML and RDF; it is a combination of XML and RDF; it is a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a combination of XML and RDF. it is a combination of XML and hDF; the file information will be stored with enlargement & quot; .xmpquot; saved the for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to make it off a original size, mostly in the raw format, to archiving. XMP is that there may be the metadata separately from the image file. therefore, you should remember if you use DNG as a container and put everything there together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organization that supports up to fully compatible online metadata in the DCMI communities and the DCMI's activities, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and workshops, standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a far-depth acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. so long the pictures on the camera is, you can use this as temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save it in your Roharchiv. this function is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine course, you can use external programs. if you edit the pictures again with & digicame; edit, then you should add the metadata again. these have been cut under circumstances of the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Use the beprocessed images for copyright with a digital watermark. export it only in Webgalerien, coding in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc.</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digicame; in the section Adding an photos to an album you will find a description of how you're already on your hard drive, however, you can already add many advanced settings to the importing of pictures to your Albendhome.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your Digitalkamera with & digicame; connect them with the computer, turn the camera on the scoremodus um and turn it to. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">If you run the camera interface, try to connect with your camera. when some cameras can be displayed. some cameras will display a while. if this is the case, the filename and a symbol for file order is displayed for each file, photos, movies, music etc. on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer you may need the camera information about each entry. with the side-related characteristics and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file properties and the Photoinformation that are stored internally from the camera. a symbol indicates that the image was not downloaded to your computer. please note that at some digitalisation is not all information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The tab Metadata displays the internal metadata such as exif, manufacturernotation, GPS etc. the image are the same as in the metadata page row from the main window of & digidered; or the image processing. please note that these metadata are not available for some digitalisation.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button. download all photos from their camera into a single album in & digicame;. when downloading the photos were not deleted and we recommend you to check if the images can be downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all photos, you can only select the desired selection method of & KDE. once you choose the photos, use the button below and then upgrade. the knob Selected is long as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera does not support this is an option new download. these images have been downloaded yet again. in this case the new images are marked with a star in the advance window. if you choose this option, of course only the new images are downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you use the buttons all the download or Selected works, a dialog with which you can select the target album, shown in which the photo album is displayed, such as normal folder you can read in the section Meine albums. select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After which you chose the target album, you press OK, and & digicame; invites photos from the camera into the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all at once by selecting the knob Delete. if you just want to delete some, so you need to select it and delete it from deleted.</seg>
<seg id="260">Note, please note that there's no way there is photos that you have deleted from the camera to restore it. you should carefully review whether the photos are successful in an & digided; album, you should delete them off by camera. if you want to delete the camera, you should do so much faster, because this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as filename for the photos often not particularly expressive names. the filename are usually deleted once you can upload photos of different types of records into the same album. hence, it can be useful to integrate the date and time in which the picture was made, into the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options to shoot and spelling of the image and for datalising sub-based sub-mode. if you use this latter option is automatically generated a folder per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transfer opens three more options that are performed before the photos on the record. the first two concern the data on the disk in the section Standard Autoridentity. if you select this, the corresponding entries will be copied from the exif information in the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct the date & time for all the downloaded pictures.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you wish to use another file format as the default format, you can use e.g. in the machining field the prefix photo -% Y-% d% H:% M:% S. place this option to add date and time. for further adjustments you should read the help of the command strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option camera file name, you have the option to change the filename in petty letters. or in big letters, if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, the & digicame, for a photo that will be displayed below the name that displays the camera in the preview. your settings to renaming will be saved and automatically used when you open the camera showcase.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digicame; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera to the schedule. not all cameras put this information. in the page row metadata, you can read more details about the information that your camera is embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic filming is normally switched, and if your camera does not provide; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to switch off the automatic rotation. if you want to turn off the automatic rotation, and select the automatic rotation in the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera records information on the date, in which the photo has been made available, can & digiding. not all cameras put this information in the target screen. not all cameras put this information available. in the section page row Meta data you can read what information you have embedded in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally off and in this case stores & digicame; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this option, you have to switch this option. use this option to activate this option and select the option file-based sub-based sub-based coatings at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to upload photos from your computer to their camera is called button. select the file selection dialog & KDE; appears in which you can select the files that can be loaded and can also select more than one file with the standard & KDE; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">Once the image selection is done, asks & digicame; you where the images will be loaded high. a folder selection dialog for the camera appears. select the desired folder and click OK to upload the upload. the images are not deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general concept in this document. this is a position which is indicated in longitude and latitude, which can be displayed on a map. identifying the data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photograph can be interesting to link an image with a concise geographical place. not everyone uses a plane to use an area by automatic recording of GPS-data. environmental planners, military, police, architecture office and real estate makler can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten when exactly the photo was made, you can send a postcard to another & digip; users want to send a postcard to another & digip; users want to locate the location of the photos, it is well to be documented that the position of a photo will be informed.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how do the GPS data in the image? first you should know that exion supports many GPS-data fields, such as the direction, Saddle and card referral. there are at least three ways to reach this. directly with the correct hardware, using the KIPI module for the geographic assignment (manual) and last for the manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera, which has a GPS unit. but there are a few who work with GPS receiver, either as a card module or by transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>

<seg id="279">Downloading of GPS data from one device can be made with gpsman or gpsbabel. you need to store this information in the file format, as this is the only format that is supported by the module for the geographical assignment.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are several programs for & Windows; and Mac OS that extract the data from images and GPS. on the following page you can make the same under & Linux: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and Breitengrade or other data then you can use this script, which works with the Exiftool of Phil Harvey. it uses the emblespoets coordinates, which can be created e.g. by maps.google.</seg>

<seg id="284">Choose action can be displayed on built-in Preview or image processing. you can create the standard behavior of & digicame; fixed if you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains how shown below, the standardization identity and copyright law. these data are automatically selected in the appropriate IPTC data fields. also with a database synchronization, these data are written into the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Authorittitles is a synonym for publishers: this field should be the profession designation of the photographer. this can be as such as an employee photographer, non-professional photographer or independent, commercial photographer. as this is a detailed description on the car park, it must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Editor is a synonym for providers: use this field to offer the photo. this must not be the author as such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be entered into the picture of another & quot;. if the image is a warehouse, then the group or agency should be available here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC-actions store the data in the appropriate IPTC field. thus, the metadata are permanently in the picture and not only in the database of & digicame;. these metadata are also available in other programs and can be imported in & digiah; imported without lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Image notes as embedded in JPEG image (JFIF) in JPEG images: these synced the comments that you can also read to your photos, with the images contained in the pictures. therefore, in pictures which have already been written, these by those of & digicame; overwritten.</seg>

<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with darker or heller color in the picture. these colors will be fixed here. in the image processing, this anchosmodus can be installed with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma subsampling is meant that the images are coded into a higher resolution of the fluoric density as well as in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the setting PNG compress you can reduce the size of PNG files, since PNG requires a fun algorithm. the only effect is that the image data can put more time for output and pack. if you have a quick computer, you can put this value on a high compression. thereby means 1: a low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option TIFF files compressed, you can switch the delate -Kompressionist for TIFF pictures. this reduces the size of the TIFF pictures. it does not reduce the size of the TIFF images, since the delate -algorithm verfunny free.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the setting of the funfuneral JPEG-2000 files you can consume freely. even if you have written the loss of quality, the ratio of quality loss and data size is far better than the normal JPEG. when this paragraph has not yet been supported, but it was not yet supported in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digicame; the image processing only was a picture of picture for photos. currently, it develops very fast to a tool for manipulation of your photos. with this dialog, you can change the settings of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default lame is that all green pixels are equal to ultraviolet green pixels of the CCD-sensor in the output. if you use this option, solve this issue with a minimal loss of details. this option draws the image a little soft, eliminated the 2x2 Gittering with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">When this option is set, the whiteboard is used in the camera. otherwise, if required, the automatic colour balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the whiteboard is not set. standard is it a fixed color balance, which has been photographed on a white map which has been photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. the benefit of the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images in four steps more details in the nickname. for other cameras this option will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is it the nickname, so the parts of your images are burned out, due to the disability of your camera to observe, as they searched the plumbing at diverse rosatönen. finally, you can attempt some parts of missing information from the nickname to record.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels generally not so quickly to satisfy the green and red. & dcraw therefore try to rebuild the missing green and red pods from the still not saturated blue pixels. of course, this is a matter how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option records, you will get the possibility to put a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and can therefore be individually adapted for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Put the Luminous according to your taste. you probably have to put it slightly higher than the default 1. this can also be made later in the image options of & digities; image processing, should hold the time for the Demosaicing small, should you be conservative.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing -algorithm is a digital image file, to count a full picture of the sub-filterated image sensor, which provides many cameras and which is a matrix colored pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA-interpolation or colour redesign.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digicame; and Dcraw provide you three alternatives to: Bilinear, VNG-Interpolation (for Adaptive Homogenic y-Directed) was the first algorithm of the Dcraw. it generates but dartefacts on the edges. Bilinear is interesting when you search a quick solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lentils you can get the red and blue corrective values here. this is certainly the best method for a color view, since it is carried out during operation.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translated the color information and there are instructions like this again. there are also LCMS and & digicame; information as well as the color information from a color room in the others are the colors as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behaviour questions, when a picture is open in the image processing, / colour management module will start with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color folder Show you can write here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, in which you save all your profiles. & digicame; studied this folder then during the Starts.</seg>
<seg id="315">Setting of the ICC's Profile you have here the possibility & quot; standard squot; for your profiles to be deposited. everything can change later on the opening of the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The colour scheme is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your pictures rather than the whole screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The entry profiles should be appropriate to the camera connections and model that you use. not all profiles are created on the same type. currently, dcraw Gamma is not available for conversions with 16 bit depth. this means that you must perform the color tone mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are more options such as the soft Proof profile, with which you can emulate as your image is returned from a device. this is very useful before you can print a smaller color area as your printer and some colors can therefore be very saturated instead of having to rely on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite obvious which are intended for them for what is provided. unfortunately, not with the models of Canon. therefore, here a table of cameras and profiling that fit together. this answer is of course inofficially:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon Profiles allows the style to realize: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & KDE; image Plugin Interface. it is an interface that is supported by a number of & KDE; image brighter and imaginations; many modules have been written; many modules have been written to work with each program that support the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, see a list of available modules. select which you want to use and these will then be downloaded by & digip. these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main menu, and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the lecture.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks that are carried out by modules can set in the menu under settings short commands.</seg>

<seg id="338">The image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digicame; so you may not be part of your distribution. further information about the KIPI-modules can be found in the section image processing.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window, the filename, current data-number, magnification factor and the current image size shows.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar on the top of the top and below the toolbar for fast access to the most common functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The machining functions of the image processing your photos. no of the functions will change the original photo before you save file memory or the knob store from the toolbar. please note that you can't restore the original photo as soon as you have saved the original photo.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should possibly have a copy of your image before you change it. this allows you to save it with file memory.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo you can restore the original value, using the menu file reproduce or the knob, connect the button processing in the toolbar. you lose every change that you have performed in the photo since the last memory.</seg>
<seg id="344">Nearly every action of the image processing can be reversed or restored. the last action you can reversed by edit reversy and reproduce reproduce reproduce from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you often use this, you should remember the keyboard, Ctrl; -Z to resellers and Ctrl; -umphins to re-produce.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; about the callback or re-pull button in the toolbar, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu-menu, all actions in between also recovered or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the image processing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same name, using the navigation links in the toolbar. if you have made changes in the menu file, you will be asked if you want to save it.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can in the photo and out out zoom in which you can use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the reference menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window Size, you can use this knob in the toolbar: enlarge it automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View full screen mode, the photo in the full screen mode. you come into the normal view, in which you do not want to use the dining table. if you do not want to change this in the imagination dialog by & digicame; stop this window, you can see the section for interiors of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current picture, you can select the image file and get the default & KDE; printing dialog. you can customize here the settings before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print individual images or whole propositions. whole image can be printed out of your selection. you just need to select the pictures with the standard methods and choose from the menu album Exporting printing assistance. if you follow the wizard you need only to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digicame; main window has a page row on the right edge, which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same page row is available, even in the image processing. it is displayed when one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multifaches Click on the same tab lets the sidebar appear or return to the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the printable view you can enter accusations with unlimited size or insert. please note the remark below. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special features are allowed to be copied in the EXIF- and IPTC- fields so that you can use of other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC-data supports only ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are recorded according to 2000 characters and use special equipment. if you want to use the IPTC printable field in other applications, you should consider these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you commented it you use either the knob, or just switch to the next picture, the indictations are then saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the object-button there is a knob more. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, but you can also select the metadata in the files. however, if you have chosen a metadata that is always written in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The section assessment shows a rating schema of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in Suches and sorting. it can be used either with a single click on the 5 stars on the page row or by the sidebar. the review from the sidebar will always be used on an image. to select multiple images at the same time, choose them from and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The assessment will be written in the IPTC field. the coding follows the schema in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The stitching view shows a searchbox on the filtering of the keywords, the sampling and a selection box with the previously used in this & digities; session uses frames.</seg>
<seg id="362">The stitch is dynamically adapted to the given search. you can restrict the number of ways in finding a keyword quickly. this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom is another relief when entering your keywords at a picture series. if you have different keywords, they are saved for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding attachment areas in the tree. all keywords of an image will be saved into the IPTC field.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected at the main view and you choose a keyword in the sampling tree, this is only applied to the highlighted picture and not on the entire selection, if you want a choice with a keyword, please refer to the section called Firstfilter.</seg>
<seg id="366">The side bar sampling filter is used to change the selection of the main window frames. usually, the left page row with its album, - Datum-, sampling and search views. if additionally a or several sampling filter, will be displayed, only the cut of these two displayed. all displayed keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also take keywords and draw. suppose you have selected in the main view over several pictures to you with stitcher, you can simply drag it out of the right page row, and appears to select a dialog, which you ask if you want to put the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example the main window shows the pictures on a calender day. the sampling filter is reduced to the keywords, which have been selected with Strg + a, and after that, a keyword is drawn from the right sampltree to choose from there. a dialog asks if this sameword is to be put.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes will take place at any start of the program. you can also be switched under settings Miscellaneous.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and determine that it would have to be one or would have to be, you can easily change it with a double-clicking on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry to the database is looking for. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or a string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can choose a Extension search of all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to use options, you only need to use the cross-field at the end of the rule and afterwards the button grouping. the options can be seen as follows:</seg>

<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was mainly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly worked at & digicame; s concrete implementation adapted.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why one sets an colorful breakflow from which actually photographed or scanned deviate from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a coloured workflow, you can reach that the colors on your monitor, from your camera or scanner the same and the colours which you print or publish the colors that they will publish from your digital dark-room.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the theme is coming to colour management, then everybody wants to know which buttons it needs to provide you for the results that he wants. unfortunately it means you are sufficient background information about colour management. in addition, links with deeper information enable you to make your own informed decisions so that you will receive the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your workflow is all six listed below, then you must don't worry about color administration.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor one on the sRGB color room. (more information can be found below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your single other image gifts are by e-mail or the Web, where sRGB of de-facto standard is.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB is so good working and the life for everyone is so easy, why you should use another farewell room and make your thoughts about colouraltng?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB compared to the colors which we really can see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colours which we can see, the hufusiform region, and the colours in the sRGB Farbraum, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some bigger color trees, so visit Bruce Lindblooms excellente page and click on information and then on information About RGB Working spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to install my monitor if I decided to work for it only in the sRGB color room?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you work in the sRGB color room or not, you need to make your monitor kallied, since sRGB of it goes without the circle. if you work as in the color room of sRGB, then you must either use your monitor to the sRGB standard, a reasonable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool makes five automatic corrections available to improve a picture in most cases. use it therefore before you try to try a further manual.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, absame, automatic and contrast, extend from the menu correct automatic correction automatically try out of your colors the best. you will be experiment with these effects, to see which best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalization: this method scaly over the whole picture, so that the darkest point black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without its color gradations. this function is often a magic correction for pictures the dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">In the same: this method justs the lightbox of the colors of the selected image, so allow the same very good results in enhancing the contrasting of an image, sometimes it does not only produce trash. it is a very powerful surgery that works either miracles of a picture or it destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic: this method maximises the color area in the red, green - and Blaukanal. you select the dark and bright harrow, and justs the red, green - and chaucanals to the complete historiograms.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast to extend: this method improves the contrast and the luminance of the RGB values of one image by the move the lowest and highest values in the greatest possible area and a reenustible of all values in between. this is only visible in selected images and can be a good correction for poor photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The whitezes of & digicame; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the whiteboard of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The whitest correction is somewhat limited to over a color room with 8-bit per color. if you can do so far from the original value you can perform areas with overexposure to which in 16-bit mode, which in 16-bit mode, you will drop your ways to correction better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a whitewalk sala. the copyright of Pawel T. Jochym is protected. you start it via the menu entry into the whitetion of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left side are both the original value as well as the preview of the target image. if you want to see dynamically the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original grinder of the original product, then it's enough to click the original window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target group has a red marker. the Luminance of the Pixels under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the histograph.</seg>
<seg id="399">To the right top becomes a historogram shown that dynamically changed once you have a parameters. this histograph is very helpful there, even in well illuminated pictures, most pixels very small Luminated values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is indicated. the sum is called Luminati.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjusting you can improve your photos or down your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">Anstat with the above controls around, you should use the color temperature of Pipette. click on this button and then somewhere on the image to use the color temperature of the white temperature of the whiteboard. on these types also the temperature and green-values are automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="402">Additionally, you can set the whiteboard with the list of preferences. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The underexposed indicator increases the colors when more than a color channel of the Pixels are overestimated.. you will see the combined result in the whiteboard. this will appear in the preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final picture.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons Save as and loading exactly this. each setting of the whiteboard you can have to save it into a text file and then load them back later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The knob presets set up all the filter values back on their standard values and the corresponding neutral wreath. please note that such a different settings may result in another photo than your original. if you save it, your original value is changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the codiments of the beprocessed image. 8-bit coding is the far common JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better for high-quality pictures. this coding is needed even more turntables, arithmetic time and stands onlyfor the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialogue as to the processing of raw material. it uses the change and assignment of color profilen. colour tone mapping can be carried out by the subwindow for the brightness of colors. a detailed guide for the use of color profiles can be used to rate the chapter gradient function.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu under colors sound-correct structure. this tool provides an integrated way to use multiple color channels at the same time. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always make the same error and you can always find the same correction. in the manual for the sound-correct, you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct issues is the tool for Graduation that you can find in colours gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digicame; tool Farbeffects will give you four color effects, a velocity filter, a neon-effect and a canton filter at your disposal.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing was solar erilization, also Sabatier called, a effect of the image arose, and after the development of the image. this had the effect that the lightening areas are darker and the colors carried out by the second lighting inverted. the result was a dividing negative of the image. this tool allows you to finalize this interesting effect finely.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar erilization. at about 50% intensity shows the image that is chemically possible. another increase creates finally a negativity that so does not create on photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of solar panels. the origination is the (1) and the process which has been edited (2). the Applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simisled the so called & quot; Velviaquot; -Effect. it is different from an saturation, that he makes a stronger contrast, which makes the colours brilliant and glazing. try it simple, he embellished many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the market name for one to daylight optimized for one on daylight. Velvia offers very saturated color for daylight and high contrasts. Velvias has very saturated color for daylight and high contrasts. Velvias strong which colors are also some photographs but also some photographs are very natural, too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neo-density filter simulated the brightness of the result. the parameter level controls the brightness of the outcome and the sliders of repetitions. at large images the filter the entire CPU for a moment can laughed.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon that you want to correct the color graving of your photos with tools in the menu under colors. once you are viewing with the results you are using the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you get a photo of bad light conditions, you can get the reversed problem: one to great saturation. even in this case, the tool for brightness of saturation, instead of it. all changes you can perform in the preview. if they like the result, you can confirm the result with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool Graduation and the simple luminous / contrast / Gamma is the tool sound value to improve the exposure. even if the dialogue on this tool is very complicated, you need for the area of sliders. concrete the three sliders below the Histogramms.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window includes a graphs of intensity, an histograph, of active channel, or of the selected area. under the Graphic one can change three sliders of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn to learn to move the regulator and to watch it on how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right hand side can be considered the original and the preview of the picture. the preview is dynamically, updated by the settings of the picture, updated. on the left side the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this optionally box can be set if the Histograms are presented with an linearen or logarithmic Y-axis. for pictures of a Digitalkamera is often dominating the linear histograms of a single column. in this case the logarithmic contracting of useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three shelves: the top for the Dark Tones, the mean for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, frequently Gammavalues called.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pinpettes can be used in the preview of the original band, in order to automatically convert the input values, middle and bright tones. in addition, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow for the selection of manual values for each field. there are also two shelves that can be used for output values as with the input values, for example, to create an extended image as background to create something different in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this knob the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and store: with these buttons, the selected values can be saved in the file system and later use the Gimp levels format used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pts, the input values are reorted automatically for all shadows, resources and Sundays. activate the color pipette to use the input values of the Histogramms for Rot-, green -, Blue and the Luminales.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option to check-off-indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and to show you the combined result of all channels. this is a indicator, that means you will get the effect only in the preview and it's no effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you can see an example for the alignment of the input values to the red, green and blue channel of an photos. intensity and Alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original value is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand, half of the original and the target screen appears. the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right hand, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modification channel: this selection box allows the channel to enter the module that is changed by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Besides this box are two symbols in order to switch between a linear and logarithmical view. for pictures with a Digitalkamera, the linear mode generated a wide beam. in this case the logarithmic mode continues.</seg>
<seg id="435">If you move for example a short panel to the right, for example the bright tones, then you can see that these bright tones with darker corns and that of the associated image are darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original fotos is a red marker. if you want to change this mark on the area you want to change the original value on the curve. create a point on this line and move it up and down, until the value after your taste is jushed.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and store: with these buttons you can make exactly this. each bend you can generate this file system and loaded later. the file format is loaded the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you use this method and the three color pts -buttons automatically create the control points of the curve to all the channels of the Schattentions, Central and Sonnentures. enable the color penter to put the control points for the red, green -, Blue and Luminanzkurve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option overweight indicator, in order to display all color channels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels, you will get the combined result. here it is a indicator, that is, you will get the effect only in the preview and it's no effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a Black-white picture, which was corrected in the Luminanzkanal. Schattende- and Sundays was applied with the color pipette and on the curves. the origination is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel-mixer of & digicame; image processing is a tool to improve the color canals or to change the color gradations of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel-Mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the color tones of images. you can edit it from the menu color channel mixer of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the canal selection, you can choose the color for the histograms: this gives you a first notice how you can correct the channels by selecting the relative distribution and rash. the original area of the window shows you a preview. the original can be seen compared to their own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position these in the image appears a vertical line in the histograph to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">Controls for the module are on the right below: Regler for Red, Green and Construction allow you to mix these channels. if you also keep the appropriate color components, as the channel-mixer then DAS tools for the production of great black-white conversions of your photos is. try to reduce the Grünkanal for Black-White portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially if you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible smoke which does not occur in the same place in the color canals and their smoker mates in each channel looks different. if that is the case you can improve your monochrome conversion through which you need the Farmer first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The Save as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any mixer setup, you can save it for later and then load the file format is the Gimp-mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option to check-off-indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and to show you the combined result of all channels. this is a indicator, that means you will get the effect only in the preview and it's no effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel is remunerated in which the blue channel is enabled. the original value is displayed under (1) and the original picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white-photography has always been fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography is black / White a work step, as colour pictures can be converted to the computer. also with a set of film rolldeprofiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white Filmbing with a green Linsecfilter. this looks good for all sceneries and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky. therefore similar to 004 Cokin (TM) Founding.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orangey: simulates a black / white filtering with a orange filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and air photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (TM) Orangey.</seg>
<seg id="454">Rotfilter: simulates a black / white filtration effects associated with a red Linsenfilter. this creates dramatic heavenly effects and can simulate mourchtsanenen to daytime simulate. so similar to 003 Cokin (TM) Rotfilter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Gelbfilter: simulates a black / white Filmbing with a yellow Linsfilter filter. this is the most natural color tone structure and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thereby similar to the 001 Cokin (TM) Gelbfilter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: creates warm luminous and medium tones for it a bit coldness in the Schattentönen. this is very similar to the process of a print and redevelopment in a sepiatoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and therefore similar to 005 Cokin (TM) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digicame; tool texture you can apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding an texture to your image, irrespective of it is a color picture or not, you can look like a oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop way of enlarged points or like a wall image on a wall. the menu entry into the image processing can be used for this.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: move this parameter to the right to the end of the depth or three-dimensional texture on the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper texture is used on the photo below. the origination is (1) and the changed under (2). the parameter relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digicame; tool frame can add a decorative frame around an image.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of an photos is not an easy task. a possibility to keep his attention. this is an psychological barrier to the streaming eye. under picture frame, the module can be started from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you place the desired Rahmentyp for your image. pertinent the image with a colored line, Niepce, wasted it with a nice three-dimensional frame that is ideal for a button-dimensional, and ornamental adds a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: returns the width of the frame in percent. the standard area for the width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">This with the frame must be larger than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing of images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can insert easy a formatted text in an image of popular place. this also goes on several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text image size, the greater the image, the bigger must be the character size. to the conclusion, simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Each setting you chose for your text can be changed until you press to the button "OK. after the image is stored once, the text part of the image. he can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digicame; tool to apply a template to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu image template used in the image processing can be used to put it on an image.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no restrictions on the size and orientation. you do not need to add the PNG file format and should be able to add with maximum compressing the file size; just send an e-mail in English to the & digicame; mailingliste digicame-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool at first time, you need to put your favorite onfolder with the knob base folder in the dialog. select the folder you will be copied to the log files. these settings will be painted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder for the stencils, a civil structure appears to be reflected in the folder structure of the Schablas superstructure. selecting a folder update the threaded of the Stencils automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this knob have enlarged the shown picture. it is centered to the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Smaller: this knob drop down the below picture. it is centered to apply the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole image, you need to classify the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move it under the template to move the picture. take the picture and place it on the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your picture. the image is then automatically adapted to the thumbnail.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digicame; represents three different tools to sharpens. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpens is a traditional tool to sharpens. it is very fast and easy, but created especially in dark areas, grasped pictures.</seg>
<seg id="481">Infant mask is working on the contrast of the edges to make an image sharply. you can use it a really good job. you can use it a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Focussi may possibly be the best of the three because he really improves the sharks. he is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters to adjust.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus and most digitised images need a correction of the shareholding colors with only minimal difference to a color point. the same phenomenon can be printed out to a color point. SLR cameras will usually need more independency as normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">At JPEG image is often a camera internal sharpening. images in the raw format is always must always be done during the processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanner turn a sharpenter of the image. if you disable it, you get control of your picture.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get needed results by raising a photo with the sharpenters. this allows you to correct it with the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should hereby deal with caution because the results does not work very natural: the sharpening of the edges, but also intensifying the noise. in general the need for the sharpening of a picture the tool can refocussed on the menu promotional refocussed. among refocussing you can find more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpens.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is a crisp. the solution to record the picture is much easier than it sharpens. use the tool to softening softening softening and experiment something with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter blurred mascot is a very good tool to remove loop from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The origination and the preview will help you edit the image. the preview showcase shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and amount. the standard values can produce good results and should be tried out first. a increase in radius, or the amount flow, the effect. if you make the infant mask, become smoked, and the impression of Grates in the vicinity of sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius presents a number of pixels on each side of a channel by the filters. high-resolution pictures allow greater radii. they should therefore look at the best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount poses the percentage between the original and the reignant picture one of the original is added. thus, the strength of the sharks set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The tail value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference difference. you can thus define a minimal difference for a needle. in this way they are labelled with a soft change between the pottery from sharks and therefore beauty faults in facets, celesticks and water surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred masking filter. the original picture is the (1) and the working picture the (2). blurred mascot was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and one threshold = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digicame; tool focused on a picture by improving the sharpenters. it used the copyright of the protected abnormality filter -algorithm of Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool is trying to raise an image of & quot; in which it creates a better approach as just to try the photo. it is using a technique called FIR Wiener Filtering. it is often achieved better results as inserpent mask. they can set it from the menu by drawing colors refocussed in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice the circular folding is much better than the Gauß'sche Faltung. the Gauß'sche Faltung is causing a very long tail, which depends far from the original pixel value, which is far influenced in most cases even very strongly influenced by the distant pixels. the causes unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular blades: this is the key parameter for using this module. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. you can set a higher value if your image is very unsharp if your image should be very sharp, but then on the sanctuary.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce artefacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. needed values are 0,5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpending effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Smoking filter: a increase in the room filter can help you cut artefacts. however, values can be higher than 0,1 only rarely. if the smoker filter can be low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very bad. a need value is 0,03. a high value is even further shifting the image.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß's bowls: this is the radius for the Gauß'sche bowls. in most cases, you should leave this value on 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. in most cases, you should also use this value unequal to zero, so you may also increase the correlation and / oderm filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matory size: this value determines the size of the transformational size can have good results, especially if you choose large values for circular bowls or the Gauß'sche bowls. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save as and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any refocussed parameters you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded for later.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try all the cutting, color - and integer structures on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image. the reason for this is that lots of operations changes they are not immediately visible, but later are inaccurate artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you want to read and compressed, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally produced unsharp mascot better results as sharpens. this could be caused by it, the blurred masking uses a larger neighborhood than sharpens.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, has to be seen blurred masking always generate Artefacts. even under optimal conditions it can never show the effect of the FIR Vienna filters. practical is the result of the FIR Vienna filters. practical is the result of the FIR Vienna filters. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better in the processing of small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can view a comparison between different filters, on a small unfocused picture, see:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color picture has to be corrected. this picture was done with a analogue camera. the infocused result is attributed to insufficient light for the car-focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods of shock absorbers in digitis you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator Glätte raises the inacces of the enpatient of the dispatient, in order to create a natural Pupille.</seg>
<seg id="514">The color tinte allows a adapted color for the Pupille. if you want to set blue eyes instead of dark, then you can set it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The instrument image error structure is one of the most advanced tool to remove the desired artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Introalgorithm was developed by IGE Team of GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the Cimperg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various prefixes than starting points to simplify the restoration. the available settings are at the bottom:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to use the filter settings on a jushing you can use the tab glyping and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detailed view p [0, 100]: this controlled the maintenance of details. a small value leads to a smooth-smoothes and details scrub. a value of 0,9 should details so that no sharpens can be identified. please note that the details can always be subordinated and should be subordinated.</seg>
<seg id="520">Automatic addiction of Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes the same in all directions, while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you can produce a film gritt or CCD robbers will produce a high value of wave-related patterns. JPEG Artefacts are best removed at a value in the vicinity of 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothes [0, 500]: this sets the maximum glassment factor above all else. p defines the relative humidity. put this value to the degree of smoking in your picture.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects bigger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is necessary, because it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulenzees, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: returns to how often the algorithm is run. normally here is 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle-gradual da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropen Alpha. if Alpha is chosen, it should also be small. beware sure that small angle will create a long term. you should therefore choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integratal stingspan [0,1, 10]: integrale stingspan in pixels. you should avoid the value of small 1, to avoid sub-pixels and never bigger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation use: the More and quality you receive by choosing this option is only minor. he doubled but the term. we therefore recommend it for him.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons Save as and loading exactly this. each setting of image error can be saved in a text file and later be loaded again.</seg>
<seg id="528">"" "" "" "image error is comparatively very fast at work. it can still take very long and take a high CPU load to move. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the knob." ""</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how imagefeller with little artefacts removed. the module is made on a photo that is used in Guatemala City with a analogen camera. as you see there is a peculiar black Artefakt in the foreground that is caused by a poor soundproofing during the trip. the origination is below (1) and the correcated picture under (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digicame; smoking is a very powerful tool to reduce images. it uses a protected algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filter to remove cures and other artifacts that come from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensorers from the camera or Moihood; -effects of eingescanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information on sensorers of digital cameras, so you can read this in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot of the top shows a typical scene which has been made with a Digitalkamera and high ISO sensitivity. it shows a bright living room which can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you need only the subwindow Details and the subwindow advanced settings may remain in standard settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for filters. great values increase the time the filter per pixels and can be found the image within the image and the color in it is explored and thus minor errors.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpening: controlled the pixel distance from the filter to the front look around luminous changes. if it will need to change the edges filter, if you need to change this setting. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and smokers or lubricate it back.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controlled the cantonal imprecision of the filter. if it is too strong, cannot be able to do the entire smoke. put it on a value next to the maximum, if you want to remove an watchstrap or JPEG artifacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Illuminated: controlled the luminance tolerances of the image. we recommend either to change color or illumination to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the breakdown process by the details of the settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend either to change color or illumination to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the breakdown process by the details of the settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controlled the gammatorium of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerances of dark areas, which typically consume stronger. it also generates the shadow.</seg>
<seg id="541">Attenuation: controls the adjustment of the phasenjigs. if it is raised how quickly the adaptive filter radius is responsive. if it is raised to high, the edges may appear. if he can appear on his minimum, can remove smoke and phasenjitter at the edges. he can remove smoking and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and store: these buttons are used exactly for them. all parameters for the smoothing that you have set, can be saved into the filesystem and later loaded.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how smoke reduction your lives can change. the origination is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the smoking was applied with default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is a crisp for your purpose. the solution to record the picture is a bit easier than an image. use this tool to softening softens and experiment with the smoothes. the preview window on the right side of the dialog displays the effect of this operation to your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digicame; photo Restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photographic tools.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restauration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of undesirable artefacts of your images. it is very well adapted to Gauß'sches Rauster, Kratzer, Compressionefacts and local bugs will emerge in digital, original or rebearable pictures, thus gets the content as well as the human eye makes.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for dyes and texturers. the algorithm to restoration works. the algorithm to restoration work was developed by the IMAGE Team of GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the Cimperg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefacts reduce: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas, it creates some compresses & quot; Artefaktequot; - small standards that are correct in the uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons Save as and loading exactly this. each setting of photo Restoration can be saved into a text file and later be loaded again.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo Restoration is comparatively very fast at work. it can still take very long and take a high CPU load to move. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce as a photo with likeness smoker.. The module is applied to a Black and White photo that has been recorded with a Minolta (TM) HP-5 movie with a Sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the touch film gritt on the faces. the origination is below (1) and the corrected below (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time has been textures to an old color photo that was applied with a scanner, which can be seen by the Scannerlights and the photo opapier. the origination is below (1) and the correcated picture under (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digicame; tool vertices allow it to remove it with a CCD camera, eight were to remove. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project that are copyrighted by Martin Dickh.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, total or my name pixels are particularly high-quality raw mode photos, as many cameras with JPEG compression about an built-in repression for my name pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; name pixel; and "quot; bright pixel; on a photo with a dark-image sub-method method. there are currently no manual method to select the poor pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file into the assistants with the button-screen. the tool is automatic the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the foresight.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old Digitalkamera, it is important for you to discover the dark picture directly in the connection to discover new names or bright pixels by the CCD set.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous paragraph, you should download the right dark picture to the corrected image. an automatic processing of the dark-image will find the bad pixels. watch the last dark-image and this automatically loads back in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the thumbnail will help you to correct the result. the preview display shows the output of the filter with the current settings. poor pixels are highlighted in all predisposition.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area around the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filters. select then the best filter method to interpolder these pixel blocks. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">Thirst: it will be an average of the neighborhoods. the resulting color will be assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels the one distance from the pixel block, are pulled to the calculation of a bi-linearen surface (2-DIM) or a group of linearen curves (1-DIM) or a group of linearen curves (1-DIM). these are then used to interpolish the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filtermethod. all pixels with a distance from 2 or less to the pixel block, to calculate a bi-square surface (2-DIM) or a group of square curves (1-DIM) or a group of square curves (1-DIM) that is then used to interpolish the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cuban: all pixels with a gap of 3 or less will be pulled to calculate a bi-Cuban interface (2-DIM) or a group of Cuban curves (1-DIM) or a group of Cuban ves (1-DIM) or a group of Cuban pixels in the block to interpolish.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the hotly correction on a color photo, from a defective digitalkamera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure to see. the original value was increased to 300% (1) and the corrected image is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digicame; Vignticifixture is a tool to correct the vignation, i.e. underexposed corners, of an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Far angle-objective, especially the medium and large photo format, you can often overlook the whole sensory area. instead & quot; vignetectenquot; (schatched) they can reduce the ners and ribbons of the image by which the light shows the sensor there. Teleobjective show under circumstances also this act.</seg>
<seg id="568">But he also has downsides. many center-filter need a factor 1.5 or 2 at the flash filter, which it impossible it impossible to hold the camera with the hand. far angle-objective, even with center filter, an opening from f / 16 or less, as otherwise unsharpeffects by movement arise.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the great sorrows of today's film and color-graduation of current filters and film-scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centeroval transformation in a raw image which is being used without such filters. the tool is valled by a Centerfilter on a picture. the algorithm is protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controllers you can control the vignorative approach and with three further the exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of lighting control at the point of the biggest density filter by 1, or by chance of a optical filter of 2, entangl.build the density to compensate for a greater degree of Vignation, reduce it to a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Leuchule, contrast and Gamma-settings: the Editing of an image with the vignation correct structure reduces the luminous thickness of the pixels. you must redirects the exposure of the target image with these options. the Regler provide you only positive values as you only need to increase the settings just.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a fine resting of the target image, so let the values for luminous / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the Graduation from the & digicame; image processing out of the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vignorative approach to a picture. the origination panel (1) shows the vignation in the corners and (2) the corrective image. an Leuchstrengthens and Contrastoplasty was also carried out in the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digicame; Linsing is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a protected algorithm from David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distorations. coloured distorations can not be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second grades covers the general geometrical distortion of the lens, and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third Grades has a similar Broadcasting, but to the edges above. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient fourth grades corrected the distant corner opposite the second grades. if you combine these two can be eliminated any geometric distoration almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">In general: this value determines the strength of the distortion of the second crades. with negative values can be corrected, and positive values can be corrected and positive values.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value determines the strength of the distortion fourth grades. this value affects the margins than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses the 'corner parameters has the' corner parameters for the parameters of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value is new and leads to a correction first grades through. negative values increase in positive the image.</seg>
<seg id="583">Bright: this value justs the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values reduce the brightness of the image into the corners, while positive values they increase.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, illustrated the dialog with a preview the distorative correction. the values that you use for your image will be saved and used as default values as default.</seg>
<seg id="585">The clock or cissening correction should be performed prior to all states or sizes. best lead to this correction than all the first by. if you want to create a picture and then do a tons-shaped correction would be the effect of Falster.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction to help you find this tool a vertical and a horizontal assistance line. move it to an important place, such as the bottom, or a building button, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines on this point. after connection you can correct the tons-shaped constriving with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you want to correct a kisseny distortion, the resulting image of black corners. you can transform these with the cutting tool in the menu, cutting from the image processing or through the zoom Regler of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most pictures the tons of select correction. the next logical step for some motives like e.g. photographs from the front, frame and paintings, it is the perspective to correct all angle in the picture 90 degrees. please note that if you have the camera with your hand you will always keep a slight exchange of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the combination-shaped correction to a church in Norway. the origination is below (1) and the corrected picture under (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate of infrared film of Gimpguru.org website that are reproduced using the known Ilford (TM) SFX200 Iinfra film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for the preview. if you look at the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Beneath the preview you can adjust two parameters set film gritt and film grating (ISO). activate the option for one high delicate movie. the ISO Regler changed the amount of film gritt and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in the transformation. green fields are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter color canals to reproduce from infrared film, especially the Grünkanal makes it no sense to use the effect on Black / White-photos as the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared edge of New Zealand. the origination of New Zealand is under (1) and the original picture under (2). the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a sort of aura in the top.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digicame; filter film gritt is an easy to use tool to reproduce film gritt on your images. this is known by classic high-speed films, such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X, well-known. to increase the sensitivity of films through the manufacturers great silverner of photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film gruntains gives your photo a certain mood or seems to postponed into the past. the treated image gets a temporal atmosphere of daily life. if you want this special, gallery-like, roadphotographic, gracious sight especially in your monochrob photos, so you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the Regler, the ISO sensitivity can be adjusted to the control of intensity and granularity of the baskets. the default value is, although frequently higher values need to be adjusted to ISO-2400, so you can apply the filter several times more times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film gruntain on a black / white picture. the original picture is the (1) and this worked the (2). the used film-sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digicame; filter oil painting generates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digicame; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. natural pictures and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two shelves to influence this effect. the upper brush elect the brush size between one and five out. dickere brushes are better for large pictures. gled control the smoothes or, from the other side looks, the shiss.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original value is marked with the (1) and which worked with the (2). PinselSize for this 640 pixels large picture is 1 and smoothing 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digicame; filter coal drawing are used color - and intensity, so stresses their gradient in the drawing are stresses. images whose gradient are slowly chosen for this effect. it is helpful if you imagined yourself to pick out the scene. this would be good pictures to start with it.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two shelves with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper regulator elects the tabular size and the lower justs the contrast (Glätte).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon blocks. the original picture (1) and the changed picture (2). the standard settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be improved by modification of the level.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digicame; filter Gravur shows your image in 3-D as if it was stacked in wax. it uses a protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digicame; filter Gravur is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3-D effect. he works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important in the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, mondlike landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast to the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the Gravur filter. the original one (1) and the worked picture (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filtering group you can transform a normal photo into a artwork by means of distoratory transforms. it uses protected algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Shaft locs 1: shares the image in cells and it lets it look like it is considered through glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Shaft locs 2: analog to the wavblocs 1 the image is broken here with a different version of glass blocs.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time to calculate and create a high CPU load. you can cancel this effects anytime with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filtering group you can transform a normal photo into a artwork by means of dissharpens effects. it uses protected algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zogenial: do not know the picture along sternical lines that emanates from a center. this simulates the unsharks a zoomiting camera and thereby generates a dynamic expression of often in the sport-photograph.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radiale Unshark: recuated the picture by rotation of the pixels around a center. this simulates the sharpens of an turned camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Removal herb: do the picture to create the effect of a non-focused cameralse. the object appears to step back into the back.</seg>
<seg id="618">Moving soap: blowing the image by horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the insharpens of a linear, z: B: from a car or train photographing, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softens sharpens: comparing the picture flush in the dark and strong in the bright tones. this is created photos with a dreamful and shiny soft focussing effects (Hamilton Effect). this is ideal for creating a romantic portraits, glamour photos or to add a warm and subtle glass.</seg>
<seg id="620">Schüttelepap: blowing the image by accidental shift from the pixels and simulates the imens of a arbitrary camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent intolerances: finds the color basins in the picture and change those without change the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: shares the photo in rectangular cells and then created it, by filling with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="624">The Regentropes are a cute little tool to make Regentropes on your picture. thus, it gives natural your images a nasses appearance. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn protected by protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Comfort size allows the size of the trop to change. since the droplet size is no longer necessary to reduce the size for small images. quantity changes the number and density of drops. Fischaugen changes the optical effect of the drop in the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use the & digiding; image processing one area freely from Regentropes. use the selection tool to choose the area, for example a face which should remain freely. if you start to start the filter Regentropes will remain free of regentropes.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of regentropy Filters. the original artist (1) shows a quiet sunset and the edited picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the standard values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, so you can bring it by spelling or rotating in the right orientation. tools can be found in the menu transform or transform spy.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo upblowing is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimalist loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture to clans is simple. the big question is how you can find a picture flbubbles and the details reblur? how can you find the missing information again? how can you find the missing information again or guess? the CImg algorithm which here is used here makes a good work. try him and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can change it on the desired size with the tool size. select the size change in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool to change the size is a linear excursion method to enlarge the pixel value. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool to bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many educational programs use a type of interpolation, e.g. Spline interpolation to enlarge an image. & digicame; use a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo ascents was developed by IGE Labors in Caen / France and is part of the Cimperg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how you want to change the size. these settings are available in the rider New dimensions and are shown below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled by entering the new size the aspect ratio of the original value of the origination.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects bigger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is necessary, because it is difficult to cherish the geometry of the image. even if you want to produce a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effects, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons Save as and loading are exactly used for this. any one stables for photo larger can be saved as a text file and later be loaded again.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo upblowing is very fast when it makes it, but it can still take very long and take a high CPU load to move. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo uploaded by a small color picture. the original is enlarged (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the Preview (2) is the result of the linear standard enlargement to the comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of photos is not only a frequent surgery, but also a frequent tool to put together a picture. the image processing allows you to create a photo with the mouse, by pressing the mouse and drop the right purpose, then you will see this rectangle then you will see the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">If you put the mouse button again, the area of the photos will be cut off. thus you can change the size of the right direction. you can easily create the size of the rectangle. a new rectangle can simply create by clicking on the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cross-section, use the button-down button in the toolbar and the photo is tailored (ctrl; + X). use the entries to save the file and save the newly created photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the thumbnail, you can change the size of the right to move the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in dialog remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool following aspect ratio, you can specify orientation as a high-format or format format. in the high-format, the larger value of the height and the cross-format is assigned to the width.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool after aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. that means that it is always the same, regardless of whether you can use, Inch or any other physical size. you can see example below a list of traditional sizes for photopapier and their side aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there exist two buttons around the selection automatically horizontally or vertical.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below within the dialog with the Max. relationship Knopf can cut down the area to access to the greatest possible, depending on the selected relation and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool after aspect ratio, its settings vary depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical order). if you use the whitewing System (Horizontal or Vertical). the changed image dimensions will be reflected in the EXIF-tables, so that the EXIF data will be reflected in the EXIF data.</seg>
<seg id="649">"" "" "" "the settings of the aid aid will help you to put your images better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic particles are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-regularity, are harmonic triangles a way to share a rectangle in similar triangles to share the diagonals.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden middle is a spacing onto various natural growth smuster, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shells or the blems of a sunflower. it deed in all possible things that we can see as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and she was already used for the ancient Egyptians. artist and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put your photos, buildings and even photos together to put your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from Fibonacci episode 1, 2, 3, 8, 8, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; from where every number after 1 equals the sum of their two progressing numbers. the resulting divisor is 1: 1.618 the golden middle. a composition that this rule is followed as visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden middle represents liquid help routes if you put a picture together. these help are placed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Goldene spiral will bring you your goal good results for your photos. compared to the third-regel produces a liquid line of the eye through the picture. this type of composition leads the view of the spectator along the spiral line and created on this kind a symmetrical visual river.</seg>
<seg id="656">A further rule are the rectangles of the golden spiral, also golden rectangles. it should give something that the eye can be at the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects. this something can simply be there without the eye, it will fulfill his task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golds triangles also forward from the above discussed gilded Spirals. their vertices of the sides of the golden triangles, are not in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles no same tricky triangles. diagonale on those lines can place a static object of dynamically.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to make your frame around your frame. try to place an effect of the professional photograph dynamic Symmetry. try to place your image flokus at one of the intersections and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can easily achieve.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options are mirrally reflect and reflect, to reflect the harmonic particles.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the knob color you can set the color of the aid lines. if you can use a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the aid lines can be invisible. in this way you can customize the color of the lines of your current picture.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to turn a picture to any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, then it happens easily that you are not exactly vertical or horizontal. this creates an image in which the things around a angle. you can fix this with the & digip; image processing and the tool free rotation. select to transform your free rotation, and jushing the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your picture with the sliders angle. the values on this sliders are stated in degrees. with the knob, you can put the slider on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image will be shown on the right top.</seg>
<seg id="664">To help your help is the module Free Rotation a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse cursor to fix the two lines. after you put it on an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now justs the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have a picture, you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to fix it is the function transform out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the picture is automatic to cut. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The option anti-aliasing is smoothes the picture a bit after the rotation. please note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All the prospective transformations are performed by a fixpoint of the reference point. this point is represented in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares to the corners of your image. the preview will be automatically reset. on the right of the dialog, you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left: displays the current angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle right at the upper right corner: shows the current angle in degrees at the top right of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right down: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After the adjustment of the perspective the picture becomes a little compound. for a single adaptation is this effect small, but two adjustments generate an twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After which you have adapted the perspective, you get untreated triangular holes in the corner. a possibility to downing this is the image to transform out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool-tool is used to move part of the image into one direction and move the other portion of the image to the right and the lower part after the left. this is no rotation, the image is distorted. with other words, a rectangle is turned into a Parallelogram. you can transform this module via transform.</seg>
<seg id="679">See your picture by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle. you can draw horizontal and vertical time. if you press releases, the angle will be shown on zero. a preview of the effects will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown on the right of the thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, a vertical and horizontal line appears. move your mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall of a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines to fix your picture.</seg>
<seg id="681">After which you have carried out the loop, the picture becomes a bit wiser. for a single note, this effect is usually negligible, but two shots are doubled as much as ignorating and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the shear, the picture has imbeautiful triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate this is to transform the image with transform out of image processing.</seg>

<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window, you can browse all pictures according to certain names, as you can see in the picture. here is after pictures, on which jesper, but not Anne Helene are pictured.</seg>

<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbum; and look at the quick entry, the screenshots and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphotoalbum; and choose the demo, in the first time you start & kphotoalbum; for the first time, or choose the menu help the menu entry into the photoalbum; -demo. subsequently, some example images can be loaded and you can try the functions of & kphotoalbum;</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you will find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a coherent of HTML -document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main picture of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this body you can see here:. as the name suggests, this body shows you data about the pictures in your database.</seg>

<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; provides you two options available to create HTML web pages with your images. one is in & kphotoalbum; integrated into & kphotoalbum; integrated version described in & kphotoalbum; integrated version which you can create via the menu File HTML...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages you need to create some settings. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and objective. in the following, each field is more accurately described.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the blicks and a description which should contain the HTML file later. at kphotoalbum; HTML-example pages you can see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next select whether a & kphotoalbum; export file is to be created on the overview page. sewing information about export files can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information is shown on the HTML pages. thus, you can avoid that information is shown on the viewer. for example, all pictures of a party are. please note that & kphotoalbum; currently all pictures can therefore not use to hide certain images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are clear, which is why this is not specifically made.</seg>
<seg id="923">Below you can adjust different resolutions for the pictures. thus, those you have to view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no pictures more than for example a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewers of your site can change the resolution at any time. he can search your images with low resolution, which results in a lower transmission time, search. if he wants to get a picture bigger, he changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this context, you place the different folder and URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">The best way to choose for all of your HTML files and for each subsequent sentence a new subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you need to select the folder, in which all your images are stored automatically. this folder will be automatically stored and select for all future pictures of the location. here you can either choose a folder or one from KDE supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check if this really select all for viewers, a web browser, after the pages were created, started. the URL that you may be here. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the set of you created HTML files are not yet in the final target files, you need to manually copy it. so that the import function, see, right, you will not need to specify the final destination of the files, but the base of the current file, but the base folder in which all subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings described in the settings vary all three to groundfolder or URLs. in these cases, a subfolder created, whose name you specify in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you're looking at a family party, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; you might want to create a HTML page to tracking the images. if you don't want to create a HTML page to consider the image information, people on the pictures, poort, etc. you have to do with & kphotoalbum; this work is not yet to do.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. you can importing other to your database. these bilinges can be imported into your database.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ if the images are stored in the file or if the file is only a link to pictures. the advantage of all the images in the file is that you may share all the pictures and this file may be so independent. the obvious disadvantage is however the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kim file, either directly from the menu File Exporting... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with a HTML file, this will create an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file is searching for the images in a simple way. first, the images are not found, so the images of the URL that you have indicated when creating the HTML files. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog box is described for the export of images that you can export the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should act internal or external .kim files. it is available to you with the following three choices:</seg>
<seg id="938">With the option Manuell to copy the .kim file you must copy the images in the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the option automatic to copy the .kim-file copy & kphotoalbum; the pictures automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim -files are normal Zip files. since most pictures have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it does not normally use the files to compressed. if you want to nevertheless, just select the option export file compressed.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is Maximale image size limit. if you want to send your friends pictures, since the .kim -file else would be very large. here you can tell the size by saying that every image is at 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the endung .kim from the web browser or from the menu file Importing... is, & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard to importing is made of four steps. first, you need to select which pictures you want to import it, in which folder you import the pictures to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you are common to the category of people on imported file (if you are a Dane) while this category is asked for your database. therefore, you are asked in the third dialog box which should be imported into importing file and which categories can be in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can imported the categories of the importing file with the categories of your current database. an example for this you can see on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to search and look at: when you see images, one wants to see often within different picture groups & mdash; if you want to discover some pictures of your Italy-holiday and you want to discover a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures, on which this friend is pictured.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual you will find the different steps from the (1) drive information about your images, about (2), through (2) to run and reputation up to (3) advanced topics and adaptations.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoalbum was started as a program for the managing of your images. it was expanded and today it also takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual there will be talked about images, but frequently, also excludes any videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the top folder of their pictures. this is a simple XML file that you can copy with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, backup on a floppy or revisions on CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; merkt the folder that are stored in which your images are stored and used these with future Starts. if you want to start another folder containing images, you can start & kphotoalbum; with the option -c album, as: kphotoalbum -c ~ / company / pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Through the menu entry menu kphotoalbum; entry into a window, with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum; in the following sections of the user guide will be explained to you the different settings.</seg>
<seg id="952">Left you see six different symbols which allows you to access settings and options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available to you by a keypress to the F1 button and one click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">In it was described you as you can choose for each picture different properties, for example people, places and tags. you can also create your own groups like e.g. items, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">You can see the dialog box that is used to work for already existing groups. for every existing group you can select a certificate and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories mentioned already mentioned. in dialogue options you can set up complete membership groups, i.e., for example all members of a group on once in a group, instead of all groups of a medium gliders as described in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In view of the setting possibilities, which are available to you with the outset of the members list. with the indicated output list, you can select the category you want to configure the category. in the left window, you can configure a list of the current category and in the right one list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; shares his module with other graphics applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module is called KIPI and means & KDE; Image Plugin Interface. Sights information can be found on the homepage of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called via the menu modules and are not described in this manual, since they are not part of & kphotoalbum; they are not part of & kphotoalbum; but most modules have a help page that you can call on the modules itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules of multiple applications are used together, it can be that the modules with & kphotoalbum; only very little tested, you should go either via the command line with the command &gt; kphotoalbum -demo &lt; usermark\ &gt; or via the menu help. say not, I would not have warned!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules over KIPI are very different, allowing it to be that some modules with & kphotoalbum; do not function. this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications that may also use KIPI is that the other applications will not support their pictures in albums: this kind of order is not supported, simulated it for some modules the order after albums, so you can use the functions with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">This simulates & kphotoalbum; the current album, which corresponds to the current view, so all pictures, which shows you the picture-show.</seg>
<seg id="963">Next to the current album must contain & kphotoalbum; the modules also has passed a list of albums. here, & kphotoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s browser shows the contents of a category, for example all persons, then each entry of this category is an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be the category that you have specified in performing dialog as a category for virtual albums, is used for example, if you would like to use the category, & kphotoalbum; so if you would have chosen people to view and pass this module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum; not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start converting dialog and select the modules that can be loaded in the range modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example for a starting screen, as soon as you & kphotoalbum; with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE application, you can easily see above a menu and a toolbar. at the toolbar you can't see information about your images. in the section we will return to this window, please click here again on the entry pictures show you an overview with all existing images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the opportunity to see each picture with comments, where the picture was recorded, etc. you can bet any image either individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time. if for example on all images jesper is recorded and all pictures taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these comments can be read for the Search and Browsing as you can in the section. if you want to see these comments if you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In seeing three lists with a text box by setting people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; because they will be used again when you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea lies the relocating of images within the list: if you have an family party and on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 persons can be arranged, so you can find that the names used are moved up to the persons more quickly and to arrange.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get a alphabetical list below, click on the icon for sorting by date below the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected notes for each image individually, you might want to edit all the selected images and provided these pictures with notes. click in this case simply click on the back and back-buttons, which are under the preview of the image right at the top right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have multiple images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to select all these images and provided the menu item multiple entries with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all available in the United States. furthermore, San Francisco and Los Angeles city are in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you can see a browser window of the U.S. as an ad group. to show you that it is a group, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the feature dialogs it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over- or subcategory. in addition, you can also make an entry simply on a category and there to make this one subcategory of this entry. attention, this requires just your categories of alphabetical order. see this.</seg>

<seg id="981">You can also use a frame also completely out. if you want to see this window later, use the button options... and here window a / hide. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry pictures in your browser, you will find an overview with thumbnails of the currently selected images, or all pictures if you have no filters. you can configure the size of the thumbnails by simple to configure the mouse with the middle mouse button. try it simple times.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you have a picture on the background of your desktop, this picture will be set as the wallpaper for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on an image, it will be displayed in the picture lights. if you have not yet opened any window with a picture player, a new display window will be created.</seg>

<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can also use with & kphotoalbum; namely pictures also, without having saved the pictures somewhere, so & kphotoalbum; in the image you can see the view of & kphotoalbum; if not all required images can be loaded from hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images, where the right upper corner is cut down, are not saved on the hard drive. for the pictures 5-9 however, the thumbnails are available, so & kphotoalbum; you can display the preview of these pictures. however, you can also view these pictures with the image.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you see, this function you need to copy files from folders and go back. & kphotoalbum; do not support you to avoid the question of the concerned CD. if you would like to avoid any trouble, like the mess of your pictures, please buy a bigger hard disk to save all images on it.</seg>

<seg id="993">The reason why you manage all your images with & kphotoalbum; manage and hours over hours with it is of course that you want to look at some point. because of this reason, & kphotoalbum; on a picture _ and video papers. you can start from the preview, as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can you see in. it shows of course the image, but additional all the information you have shown on the picture, such as who is on the image when and where it was made, etc.</seg>

<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can use rendering. & kpovmodeler; 3.1g to rendering, this program has to be properly installed. when this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To renew the current scene, click on the icon Rendering The symbol of Renders in the toolbar or select the menu-entry view scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini-files. it determines the image size and the quality of the rendering. if you want to insert a scene in different images sizes and quality levels, you can create any number of Render Modes from a fast preview of up to full quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the icon The Render settings in the toolbar, or in the menu View of Render Modes..., the following dialogue is opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but is a name that can detect the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the box card size you can enter the width and height of the calendar image. if you want just a small area of the image Rendering, select the cross-section below and give the image to rendering into the entry fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the Combinary field quality you can select the properties, the & Povray. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diffuser reflection. a detailed description of the Render features can be found in the user Guide to & Povray.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is divided by only a beam per pixels. these images often have a moirè pattern or marches effects in curves and lines, sometimes details are not shown if they are smaller than a pixels. this effect is called Alierasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray: uses a technology called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of these bugs. generally speaking images with this property is better off.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn anti-aliasing, calculated and connects & Povray. more than a beam per pixels. this technique is called super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray: supports two methods of the super sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling is adapted to the neighbouring Pixels; rekursively, because each pixels is always divided again and adaptive because the revocation of the deed colour evaluate.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, followed POV-Ray a beam pixels. if the difference between the color value indicates the neighboring pixels, then both pixels by the persecution of a specific additional number of pixels with super-sampling will be charged, at a low level of 5 then 5x5 (25) added beams per pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixel is calculated as: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixels, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixels. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -B 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixels. if the difference between the color covers the predatory threshold, then the pixels will be examined in 4 subsections, which are individually pursued and set out to further submissions. the maximum depth of records can be placed with the depths.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the production of smokers for the beam process, called Jattering. if you disagree on, changed & Povray, the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for the quality of the renderns is diffuse. this is a experimental property of & Povray, which is diffuse light reflexion. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map, you can set whether the Alpha channels should be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixels is then transparent, if the related beams no property met.</seg>

<seg id="1077">You have just installed & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; and now you would like to start without more accurate knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should create the ultimate but easy scene, under beginnings very popular: a ball on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings so that you get as a result only one black screen. if you use a 3D program, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you have no camera set, no rules for rendering them can be applied as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not include light sources, your whole scene lies in the dark and you only get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have everything error-free, take a look at the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following disclaimer:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the available symbols of the toolbar. read the documentation, so that you can expect a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; start with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you must first remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the menu entry. so you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model show shows how the camera looks all the scene that you create. especially, you notice the view of the scene from the view of the camera. this shows you the result of the renderns of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if they click on it, see the content of the display properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the user's document to & Povray, please find more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Change anything to the basic settings of the camera, this is later instructions, but note that you can change the camera on the camera. simply click with the left mouse button on a box point and drag it to the desired place.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you apply the button, or press the abetaste, change the wire model and the tree immediately according to these settings. as a result they see here the scene from the view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many possibilities to create the ground for the scene. you could include a quader (inserveral body quader) and the size on x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but that is a cumbersome method for solving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; offers actually a simple way. you can use an infinite plane as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the tree-tree, change the name and press the button. in the tree-tree the new name is immediately displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The "" "" "" "the wire" "" "view now shows the level as well as at the moment only as limited European level. if you are the scene" "" "limited European level, extends the level up to the horizon." ""</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you want to view the object tree exactly, you will notice the default options for each new object: scaly, rotation and shift. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the properties tab.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should move the ground to exercise a unit among the skyline, in order to get to know some of these parameters. select the shift and make values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">Choose the ground in order to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose something different from the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialogue opens in which you can choose how the object is inserted. please select the item in the tree-view (name = floor Pigment), with one click on the button "preview you see how the pigs now looks.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course shows the preview of the pigments only one Mattes black material, because you can still need to check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview. you now give the colors for the pigment. also there are many possibilities, but do now take the easiest.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you see the preview of a color on quader and ball, click on the button button and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the ground now is right now. if your picture is now displayed with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the color. you have expected to enter two new attributes. in the color list you need to do two new attributes. then edit this entry twice (you can also do this even more frequently, but the chessboard machine can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Choose in the tree-tree-time and change the colors in the view of the properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step you should already run it, since you should have understood the basic way of & kpovmodeler; the ball can be understood just as easy as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings. put the value for the radius: on 1 (forget not to apply the input to the ground. otherwise the ball would float above the bottom, since you moved the ground to move down a unit down.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the rendering now yield a strange result: how to see before, the ball-surface appears as a Mattes black material. put it in the following step an appropriate material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now specify a material. just like the floor, enter the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Choose Erstes sub-object and change the name for example in sphere Pigment. click on ball pigment, then select Incolored and put the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can reach more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Change the values as shown in the following screenshots and click on or press Enter</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings gloss effect and reflection are already partly good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed finishes, even though metal: not selected:</seg>

<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP you can exchange your scripts data with Amarok and Amarok. the easiest way is the use of the command dcop; which each KDE should be installed.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripts do enable the trigger of external programs and commands. this is usually called exec () function. in this way it can be called dcop &gt; relatively simple. here is an example in Python:</seg>

<seg id="1196">Amaroks script-management can also install script packages, which can be compressed with bzip2 (.btender), which can also be compressed with bzip2 (.btender). we recommend a filename such as e.g; B. means that the user can clearly see the archive clearly as Amarok script package.</seg>

<seg id="1514">Among the audio forms, the information provided by means of compressed concrete model, are MP3 and OGG. OGG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in der audio quality at lower biting (up to 128 kbps), but about this bitrate the differences will produce less important, since both codiers produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O 'not so' free, lame is provided free with most distributions, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high quality (with high bitumen), but compared to OGG slightly deeper quality in deeper biting.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard by a computer or a computer-based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special car-stereo systems. today - at first 2009 - support these devices often only the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A brief list of parameters to audio-quality and resulting from the compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for other parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting results good transparency for most people and most of the most people</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard' = This setting usually offer for most people and most tunes acceptable transparency, and has already quite high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme' = 224 to 256 kbps vBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo system with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -B 256' = 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs more 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h' = 128 kbps CBR joint stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. well Just for music of young people, portable devices and Autostereoanlagen. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you definitely want the highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that can be installed manually or by the program automatically from the freeDB over the Internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can be given / used with & kauditors; and the codierator program around the folder and file name as well as the characteristics of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with encoding programmes, there is often a combination of program, for the codierer and these parameters, here. the manual or help of the codiers declare the switch to these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">E.g. to add the & CD; titles to the sampling (English: day) when MP3s can be added with lame, the switches of lame and the title parameter of & kauditors; the result looks so out: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiences; parameters that can be used (= Knopfbording in assistants):</seg>
<seg id="1530">That's what the freeDB is: a free database, in which persons can download the audio CD, so all others can download the information instead of yourself in the machine: & CD; titles, artist, names of pieces & etc;, not by the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (at m of the Uebersetzers: so that the author is meant to be no lawyer. however, no one may refuse that you are on the & CD; more or less worthless, so you can neither get damage to the artist's music; more or less worthless, so you can neither get damage to music nor CD; business, physically or virtually.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kauditors; is active a proposal to select (submit an address). for the use of freeDB may not be used with another (counterfeit). in this type of configuration, it does not appear, the e-mail address given by the server does not use (This can only know the programmer which has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are in many countries copies of the main database. if & kaudispread; for the use of freeDB is to be used, the geographic on the next underlying mirror-server will be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and is like the load between the bills.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit at freedb.org delivers a recent list of mirrors for the online call of & CD; information while reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually issued monthly) just the updates to the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">What output program is used to store pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There is rumors that cdparanoia is used; who want to know exactly what it is exactly what I want to read right on source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; it's always necessary to install the cdparanoia package from the right distribution first has to be installed if this has not yet happen.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the stored WAV files the codierer and therefore the desired file format will be chosen for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (OGGs) and FLAC (OGGs) and FLAC (OGGs) and FLAC (OGGs) and FLAC (OGGs) and FLAC (OGGs) and FLAC (OGGs) and FLAC (OGGs) and FLAC (OGGs) and FLAC (OGGs) and FLAC (OGGs) and FLAC (OGGs) and FLAC (OGGs) and FLAC (OGGs) and FLAC (OGGs) and FLAC (OGGs) and FLAC (OGGs) and FLAC (OGGs) and FLAC (OGGs) and FLAC (OGGs) and FLAC (OGGs) and FLAC (OGGs) and FLAC (OGGs) and FLAC (OGGs) and FLAC (OGGs) and FLAC (OGGs) and FLAC (OGGs) and FLA</seg>
<seg id="1538">The coalition package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the cookers may be used. this is also required for predefined codierer. more information about codiers are in chapter Welch Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a codider, more information about his switch can be obtained through the input of a command like lame -help or lame --help in a consolete window (eg; console). there must be 'lame' replaced by the name of the installed body.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the setup of the Device-drawing of & CD; / DVD disc, the desk and readers are installed by both cdparanoia as well as the audio-codierer of your choice (lame for MP3s, FLAC & etc;). try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal block. this could give a note that is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check out the sheath of & CD;. this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips as you have to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, all understood, but somehow still unsure what to do is? well, no problem, follow this step-by step example, and you will get enough information to adjust to those fields that the program is exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time and read our first & CD. we will use lame '--preset extreme 'use MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 stitch (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">You need to be installed on your computer. both programs should be installed as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found as not completely free software, as it is not necessary to compile the source files, which of course you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is and that you have imagined it (eg; by trying to copy with the queror to copy).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic set of & audiences; and something which probably needs to be done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure to read one & CD; what can be repeated for each expuling & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the compression of the music (lame) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). since we are lazy, we share the program with the freeDB to download the & CD; data from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not edit them on any event of a & CD, if once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device recording is handed over to the reader program so that it can read & CD; -data / pieces can read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom a symbolic link to the real Device drawing of your drive. if this is not working or if more than a & CD; / DVD player can be specified, so helps a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt to use the existing entries of the equipment records for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The card map General settings. here gits not much to do. here, an additional conversion will be defined. in our example everything will be shown as shown as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only when uncomplete information may choose, so you will be informed when information about the testimonials of keywords (tags) are missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card map CD; -settings. just select both entries. we are comfortable and allow the & CD; data automatically download via the Internet from a freeDB computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the calculator must be connected to the computer & CD; to access the Internet, so that he can access the freeDB server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is easier, a & CD entry is easy, will immediately start reading the & CD;. this is easily changed by the database entry and the name of the directory name / filename or day entries, they can easily changed. the directory entry and the ID3-tags with Kid3, the & KDE; tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Aside from this example it is further to note: if you want to manually enter it. however, these over 620 MB large, consider this to use the database before. however, this is worth 620 MB large, at least the first one. the mode is set on the following map map.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us freeDB. these are settings for your details on request, for calling the & CD; information from the freeDB server via the Internet. how does the system to get the CD? read the section about freeDB. put everything as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we have not downloaded the database, we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">The CDDB server: please go to page freedb.org and have a look after a mirror server in your area. on this road the burden will be distributed among the invoices. this setting will be used as first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both are functioning what the server affects, as many firewalls the protocol 8880 stardly boiling, there is perhaps more luck with the protocol 80, since the & HTTP; protocol is usually open to surf the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example we do not want to submit & CD; data to the freeDB server. the first anarchist field should be disable.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take over the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the folder / tmp on your computer exists)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously coinciding pieces: sorry, there is a reason why more than one at the same time occur at only an existing drive? Paralleles reading and coding? the author does not know it, therefore simply try.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece: cross out this to the & CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined folder for temporary files: if you do not have to be saved the path / folder, in which the WAV files is stored, the box is not created in the private folder. forget the files in the private folder. forget this folder if you want to make something with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All such as it is displayed on the screenshot. the command is somewhat long, under circumstances must be caused slightly to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of MP3s. as previously mentioned before, it is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. it reached the average of about 224 to 256 kpbs. the reached compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and storage.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for the restriction of the generation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tagger for & KDE; in case of a later modification of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input (including the full path) and the output path (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest as shown in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside of this applause:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously to codiating WAV files: with a ducore or Quadcore or even a multi-processor machine can be tried to coding more than a WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is it, we have just finished the basic set of & kaudiences; terminated this configuration is used as standard for each outread of a & CD; if you have chosen the organisational structure of your music you need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section describes how the process of the readable of the & CD is described. we will set MP3 files. the folder structure is designed and set up a connection to the Internet, since we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freeDB will need to be described in this section, must be repeated for any trigger & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD, which is still not included in freeDB, see the screenshots from a little different than that for a & CD; with successfully from freeDB data. therefore, you will learn the & CD; data manually to pick up, instead of them from the Internet. comments are to point out on the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Do not try the & CD; this applause to find. it is a 'special' issue of the author of this handbook.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not done yet, now the & CD has to be defined in the drive, which was defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and its length should be listed in the window, as shown in the screenshot. this only when the & CD was identified as audio CD; and could be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen, then search in the section questions and answers following the help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD could be picked up successfully by the freeDB, all titles of the pieces are already filled and also the name of the artist and album are indicated.</seg>
<seg id="1581">For the event that there is more than an entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; -key for your & CD; there is a window built inside and you can select the database entry that your opinion is best to your & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not have the cross-crossing of freeDB (on the page & CD; -settings in dialog for the settings), you can also manually end manually by choosing the first button in the toolbar. if you have no local database, but the data from the Internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD-Editor - input of the CD-Data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screenshot. the title of the piece in the first line of the 'update title', the rest of the data in the entry field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must no longer be given in the entry field 'latest title' unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for the individual comments of iniell per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments that are common to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful call of the data from the freeDB is not empty, but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD Editors (such as if all words are satisfied with big letter or not...), but also to check if there are any undesirable comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use only ID3v1-tags. this is limited the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artists, album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the commentaries. if you have ID3v2. if you set up ID3v2. if you set up ID3v2. if you set up ID3v2. this option is set up on the tab plane; take a look at the section 'basic settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the day-information of the generated files later with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files with him, you can also create ID3v2.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags will not support from all Kodiers or file formats. see you in the help to Kodierer to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that is obviously wrong with the style of the trigger CD; this example is not important, since we do not transfer the & CD. for more information go to the Internet page of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are to be found under rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After the election of 'OK' come back to the main window. simply click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD-Editors appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the given data, which we have recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current item. the title of the item in any case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed to the same way to you all the titles data of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the freeDB. it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. please note that the artist and the album above the Stückllist are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there has been a check-sign in front of each line of a piece. only the titles which are highlighted above. a simple click on the line are selected, or you put the button all pieces select at the bottom of the screen to choose all pieces at once.</seg>

<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is too fast or too slow, you can click on the arrows left and right of Tempodisplay and so the playing speed. to be back the original speed, double click on the Tempods LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The Leertaste has two tasks: when a piece is abplayed, a pressure on the button's break or selecting the menu entry into the menu, thus breaks the playback. you do not play the Leafar during no piece, starts & kmid; the reproduction.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be saved on two ways in a piece of music. some pieces are used textiles, others using Liedtextiles and again other both. some pieces have no text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can set what events are supposed to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically selected, so you have to set nothing manual. if so in the menu setting the entry automatic editor, you will always have the opportunity to change it if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set up an event type, select from the menu Settings, select the entries of text files or incluties. the same function also have the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you summarize. these are displayed in line. in this section, how you can use collections effectively.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, open first the collector manager. this will be shown in the menu collection under the point.... Click there to New and give the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then select the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs as the original.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than a collection, you can adjust the collects in the Collective manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">Into the temporary collection all the songs that you want to add no other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application this collection will not be saved. concerns the when you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, she needs to be selected at the collector manager. there you can add one song with the button. it appears in turn the file dialog with which help you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the setting automatic shutdown to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">If Automatic Adding to the collection is enabled a piece when opening (using file opening or Drag & Drop) automatically added to the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">When Automatic to the collection is not activated, when opening a piece of a piece the temporary collection will be activated and punched. this collection will then be added.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you must open the collector manager to select the collection and the desired song and then click on Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs will be played. if you choose the row from the submenu check out the menu collections, the songs are played in order, as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add songs or remove or remove any order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, choose it in the Collective manager, or use the output list via the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump a song to jump, select the button neighbourly song, the entry next song from the menu or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump a song back to jump, select the button-out piece, the entry previous piece of the menu or press the arrow left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collector manager, select the delights collection and click on the button-deletion.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection can not be deleted. however, this does not matter, as it is not saved in leaving & kmid; not saved.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizer that are not General-MIDI-capable. in this case the MIDI map General-MIDI-MIDI events in events that understands the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example you can create a MIDI map, all events of the type Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the type Change patch to Trumpet, and thus always a trumpet, if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one sound card, you do not need any MIDI map, because all Soundcards are GM -compatible (incl. AWE - and GUS -cards, FM radio devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Unfortunately, there are no programs to create MIDI-Maps, so you need to edit the appropriate file from hand (with your favourite).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text-file that stores all required fields to play a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear, except the KEYMAP section, which may appear as often as desired. prerequisite for this is however, that every appearance has a different text (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Deficits PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP "A further keymap"... END Define KEYMAP... END Define CHANNELMAP... END options... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to view that a section begins (except for options) and END, that the end of an evening is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as e-mail so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support for devices that are not General-MIDI-compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section the patches of General MIDI to your specific keyboard are shown as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the sign label will be ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optionale AllkeysTo M is needed to put this instrument on the tone with the number M. if your keyboard does not support you (GM-patch 127), you can use a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which is similar to the PATCHMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is supposed to play a touch with Patch 127 (Win), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term drum patch the patch represents, where every sound is a different Perkussioninstrument (Trommel, basins, Maracas & etc;) and not the one who possess the tone of the tonheight of the always the same drum (like him) some keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to specify as tones on a specific channel or instrument. use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the order of the lines is very important, as well as their presence. you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keyboards for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use different names on the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keyboards are used mainly to check out tones on the pert-channel-channel. look at as an example the provided keyboards.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section may be used to convert some channels to others. if you want to spend the first and second channel, make it quite simply in CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are usable for keyboards, which have the percussion on a particular channel (General MIDI to Channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">Midi-devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following patterns:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel shown on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the keymap will need to be defined in the file. if you need to change the Forcepatch option, all the events are ignored. in this case the patch will be used in this channel. in this case the patch will always be used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The option Forcepatch can be useful for example to use the Perkegel patch on the perky-site.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for Pitchbenderratio is to be multiplied in which ratio Pitch-bender-event will be multiplied by the value n, this with the formula n * (r / 4096) is expected, and then transmitted accordingly. the value of 4096 will be used in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting will be used because GM indicates that a keyboard, which should play a Pitch-bender event with the value of 4096, a tone higher to play. unfortunately, however, some keyboards up to one octave higher to play. to try the right value on your keyboard, you must try a bit of & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, open the dialog MIDI settings. this can be found in the menu under settings, point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The sealview is a window with a whole row Klaviatures (one for each MIDI channel). on these piano, you can see which sounds are being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the rabbit view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a instrument, illuminated the knob not more green but red, to view that no more the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The sealview has (until now) two different views to view the donated tones. the view select menu under the point of the sealview: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The pace LCD shows the speed display, with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. if you find e.g., a song be too fast to follow the text, you can slow it. to change the pace, use the arrows left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece must be played. it contains the notes, the rhythm, the speed, & etc;. with this one can perform the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can use anybody to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs around 50 KB, while an mp3-file will need a similar sound quality. in a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc; you have control of everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) of & kmid; have happened because & kmid; without AWE support was compiled. to eliminate the problem you need to install an source distribution and install (for example from kmid; 's Home)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree to support & kmid; Drag & Drop. open the folder you want to add in & conqueror; select all the files, and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Activate before default the setting automatically add to the collection. otherwise the files to the temporary collection will be added.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can click the arrow key to the left of the Tempo- LCD, to restore the reproduction. in order to restore the standpoint you can click on the LCD double room.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have played on one & KDE; -Working area a & conqueror; -window with my MIDI file and & kmid; in this way I need to play a MIDI file or I want to play a file, only into the & conqueror; display window and the desired file into the window of & kmid;</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file without having to add a file without them to a collection, turn the setting automatically added to the collection, and the new; file will add to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Take off you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. sugars just want to play the first file. so you set the setting automatic shutdown to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then, close yourself to create B.mid and C.mid, and create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. all the warm thank you! if I hear this songs or see the postcard, animates me that, further to & kmid; to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; at the moment I'm in the third year, so I try to take a lot of spare time for my hobbies, but I try to take a bit of time. as Hobbies I collect programming, MIDI files, music make and phrases.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / karaoke files if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you just want to make me happy, write me an e-mail: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrakis.it</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really make me a huge freude if you send me a postcard from your residence or a MIDI- / Karaoke file from a local group. once you want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file, you should contact me by friends by & kmid; but you should get in touch with me, as I might have the file already.</seg>

<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good soundcard or an external synthesizer, since the sound quality depends much on your soundcard. it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you do not have any sound card, you must compile & kmid; with the parameters MODE _ demo _ ONLYVISUAL, except if you could have a sound card, except that of course you cannot listen to music.</seg>

<seg id="1709">The application window is formed from so called andockable windows. there is always the window with the playlist. and finally there is a information window, which is only displayed when information is remit.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to pick up links below the bookmarks, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries, which should be played to each other, so you should use the category permanent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to get an additional Hierarchy. if you copy an entry to the current category and the reproduction begins with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' latest piece ', television and permanent playlist can also be changed by direct editing of XML configuration files. of course, one can only do when & kmplayer; but also through the application itself. simply click on a name of a category clicked, click on the menu view and next to the next machining of a subgroup only the XML content of this part is shown.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, needs to be selected from the menu with playlist, and either selected the machining mode, or another category are selected.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes will be lost when the processing mode leave or another group is selected without the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & kmplayer; some functions can only be switched on through the changing of the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during the species and terminate can be disabled by the editing of ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and changing from [General Options] No Intro = 0 above. if the option is not available, it can be easily added.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & kmplayer; the files will be ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer / share / apps / kmplayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during the Launch does not need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening a different source. this would be disturbing the user, however, the user can therefore end the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start-animation can be the ads of a favorite photos: & lt; img _ h = "indylining; & lt: / / / home / Koos / mum.gif; & lt; / bodygt; & lt: / bodygt; & lt: / bodygt; and in directory tests / some examples of SMIL the by & kmplayer; are supported.</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a rider for configuration of Mplayer in the configuration dialog by & kmplayer;. here, the path of the MPlayer and the intermediate space can be set out of the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for debugging is the knob 'console' in the toolbar of kmplayer. here is the output from mplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this playlist dialog by & kmplayer;. everything must be configured by manual processing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayingc. here is an example like a 'flash' using the module-fdec-mozilla:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash' can be played within & kmplayer; it can even be added to the specific box Embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>

<seg id="1726">So always a given backend for a certain MIME type is taken (of course only if this has been chosen), this must be done by manual changels of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, phonon all ogg files will be recovered:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& kmplayer; can be installed from TV cards, either via MPlayer or XVideo (this need kxvplayer). before TV, you need to be configured to use-to-use device and the TV channels. this can be used manually from the configuration file or the configuration file can be converted manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">To the configurate of the VDR (video data recorders) settings in the mmplayer &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port to use. there you should be selected by which one is selected. the correct code has to be found (e.g. is PAL on West Europa), the correct name is probably one DVB in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support from kmplayer only XVideo can also work (presumably this type of playing video devices under Linux the only works). this is why the videoforlinux extension to the X Server functions must therefore be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config)</seg>

<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes every element in detail. everything about the possibilities and borders is described in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a meeting document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but it contains only the item type over itself nothing else.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tags is a script function. when using it is & lt; attr &gt; an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>

<seg id="2013">Defines the position of the attributt of a tags within a dialog. this day can occur for every attribute in a dialogue only once (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; -day). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Returns the position and size of a field in dialogue. this day should be present for each field in dialog (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; day). this element is empty.</seg>

<seg id="2019">To review the TagXML files, the tools is set up in the & quantaplus; window windows to start and inspected TagXML. a further dialogue will appear to follow its simple instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This feature is currently not available. currently, the verification is only at the load of the TagXML files in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following example for a family 1 tagXML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; -item from the & W3C; & XML; -Schema. the filename for this day file should be schema.tag.</seg>

<seg id="2024">The & descriptionrc; file is just fairly simple and there is an editor which can be easily accessible via DTD Bearbeite DTD Settings; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; should be created a simple & descriptive; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] Version = use 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN) nickname = The simplified name of the DTD. (HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is considered nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">A action may be created with settings promotions... click on new action to get the same dialogue:</seg>
<seg id="2027">This promotion will be assigned to the keyring. with clicking the button can be assigned a keyring. with Kone is the current keyring.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can be entered a text in the determinant settings and included with the execution of action this text is inserted in the document at the current byte position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful sharpyp. with the help of this action you can use external applications (usually scripts, but it is not restricted) to change the document or as input (or parts of the document). examples from & quantaplus; themselves are the quick start-dialog, or the different Read in... actions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter are stated. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript. sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths allowed, it is advisable to use the scripted variable in the commands: $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / image in their path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document, file: / from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% PID: will be replaced with the PID of the current & quantapSaul; only one instance is running, the text goes to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; by external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the filename of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above-hand methods can use a script inputs of & quantaplus; in the default input. in the selection mode input may be determined, which is to be sent to standard assignment.</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected part of the document is sent to the script. the% path variable is usually sensible only with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output can be redirected to the application. there are two types of output: standard output, on the default version. it can be specified, which is set by default the default written text by default the value of the selection range is set:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the Markup language, it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups. in the given case it is not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar is added, you must add promotions and configure your settings promotions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are fairly self-made. press the New action button at the bottom of the window starts the Edit mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Complete all the fields and add the day to the right toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and, in case of the day attributes, and you are planning their use, enable dialogue "day, if available so that a input when writing your action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is that a ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbols that the action is better represented, we will use & kiconedit; select from the & kmenu;, graphics other programs (or where else it is located at your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used by default 32x32 pixel, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size rest.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created icon is not only helps you to remember what the action is doing, but also to all other users of the & DTEP.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to that the day start, I have decided to create a runknob as a symbol. through the use of green (green will usually be interpreted as wrong, rigged to continue, or should at least, a message to the user, then clicking this symbols must be a & lt; working day in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After the creation of the symbols must be linked to the action. this happens via the menu with settings promotions... (in & quantaplus;) and selection of the desired action. next to the text field is an knob, press him.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the stored symbol is, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the button button and continue with other tags, such as there is still, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to complement some usual & quantaplus; -functions for the toolbar. open the toolbar set in several groups. open the toolbar set up dialog by settings toolbar. make sure that the desired tool is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to choose the denominator (very left) for my work toolbar. after the selection of the element that is to be added to the toolbar, you press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">I would like to add a quick way to access the conqueror preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note, as the denominator can support the grouping. anyone who knows my work toolbar, could believe that the & conqueror; -button on the opposite of the start-head.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by Probieren of all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Backup in the right folder. after NeueXML does not exist, it will be stored in the right folder, but your toolbar (s) should be loaded in the right folder. please adjust their toolbar (s) if a file is opened from the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the mentioned extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the opportunity to add documentation for scripts, or the formatting speech, which you like most. therefore describes this chapter as I create a & PHP; documentation for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; -Repository check if somebody has done already for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first, you need to search an existing documentation for formatting - / script / etc. then you need to create the docrc file. the first part we leave you to treat the second we treat here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, # Securities Sec2.2 = Sec2.1.1.1 Sec2.3 = Sec2.1.3.html = Sec2.html 2 = Sec2.html tag1 = tag3html tag3 = tagged html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentary tree. for example, you can now see in the & PHP; documentation as something:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level, # 4.2 Reference Table of Contents = index.html-Started = Introduction = Introduction = Introduction = Introduction = Introduction = Introduction = Introduction = Introduction = Introduction = Introduction = Introduction = Introduction,... Basic database = language.basic-syntac.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before started and Language Reference. this shows that it is subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known border for the box levels (except the reason) mdash, but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">You notice that the content of the directory is directly listed on a file (and consistent at the top end of the Baumanvision & mdash; folder will be displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">No signs influence nothing, but pay attention to & and & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus. resources.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The ingredients section is the area of the docrc file that is intended to be shown in writing a & PHP; scripts, the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function is to be displayed. by mark the function named and Drying of Ctrl; H for context the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context menu (contextList) and the file binding.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of both confiscated context elements that are to be available (for & PHP; and these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / doc for local and global use. then create a folder in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these well and value are being shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation have been used to the & quantaplus; -Repository for use by the & quantaplus; -communion. they will not be rich, but proud of it to have worked on the best web developments.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to divide the resources (DTEP packages, toolbar with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by e-mail to friends, partners or otherwise whom can send an email menu item, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) via email, in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, where all other & quantaplus; -users can download them. the contributions are verified and only available when our team is considered correct and usfully responsible for publication. thus, the origin of the resource is guaranteed, both for our team as well as for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for their private GPG key (the Passphrase for their private GPG key), or in the case you can share a search. in dialog new resource you have to pass on. in dialogue New resource you must stay empty (URL-preview can be empty) and with you click OK to upload the uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The uploading can upload the menu DTD DTD package (DTEP) upload, toolbar, and in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree began.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, still before installing, investigating & quantaplus; the inversy of the resource by checking the integrity and the Signification. in case of problems it is given and it can then be canceled carefully. if the integrity are given and the resource is correctly signed, a message with the indication of the author of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work to XML languages which is currently not being created by & quantaplus; it is necessary to work by a DTEP package. the creation can be time-consuming, because hundreds of day files in the day XML format may be necessary. there is the easiest way to convert a DTD automatically to a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD charging and Convert a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description which should be used. afterwards the following dialogue appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target-name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with that name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / quanta / dtep folder.</seg>

<seg id="2080">Fuse of DTEP after conversion: when activated, brings & quantaplus; after conversion the & descriptor; -Editor, with the details of newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus; there are some key concepts. to understand this and full benefit from & quantaplus; they have to do so first with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to help them exactly these concepts without their understanding & quantaplus; little benefits rest.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the work area is divided into three areas: global, locally and projection. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantapr.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone who is marked & quantaplus; cookies is all that is marked by a globally structure of & quantaplus; this allows the group of administrators different toolbar, actions and patterns in the global tree, which will be available in a multi-user environment at the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements introduce a personal collection of web developer for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbar. local elements are stored in the user directory, so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related items are available only within a specific project. this can be everything from & CSS; -patterns to work with special promotions specially designed for the files of a particular project. simply said, this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder tree and patterns of all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of several main areas: the Editing window, the map views, the box with information and the toolbar. please refer to, and for further information about these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click on the box with the right mouse button to download a context menu with the current documentation, such as the current, other or any boxes, recharging, delete or uploading of the document, jump to a bookmarks or execution of CVS-commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right click in the editing process to a further context menu regarding the revised document, such as basic machining steps (out / paste / paste), processing under the mouse-indicator of tags, help to the word under the mouse cursor or opening the file when the string pointer is referred to a file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the editor, the toolbar of the editor is at present & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard for which one set of toolbar will be shown. in the course of further elaboration of & quantaplus; the toolbar is adapted to the new features and connected user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbar is really easy. if they want to insert a simple day, e.g. & lt; pgt; in their document, then click on. now she can insert the data for this just before (like anchor), you can fill in a dialogue different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The building-view (QIT;) allow it to navigate in the information of & quantaplus; to navigate, they are open and enumerable. in the representation with cartels are available for files, project, scripts, scripts, and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides all files in the project and allows the handling of the files in the project by a legal mouse click. actions like Adding, removing, uploading or deletion of the files from storage media can be performed with the displayed context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another way of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: images, executable, a whole website & etc; There are all possible options open.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on which connection they are used. the category depends on the & quantaplus; working area. global templates are always available, local templates only for the relevant users and templates in projects are available only in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripts. the concept of the integration in Global, locomotive and project is also available here. by clicking on the right mouse button you can start the available information on a script. on the right mouse button are available, such as the script to edit or send to mail.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, one shows the internal structure of the active document. through links-clicking on the item of the element. by right-clicking of an element opens a list of commands in terms of navigation and drifting of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears under the other construction sites. with it can change manly attributes and naming rooms. it allows modification of all available attributes with few clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from quantaplus; 'documentation pages, one can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be projected and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two boxes will be reached at the bottom of the window, about the beneficial information can be reached: the messages window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This box will display information about each in Quanta running script, such as the DTD version of the current document and all changes to the DTD.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This box will display all errors in the awup of the current document. & quantaplus; scripts, which are executed, give all error registrations (so that gives) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; toolbar is extensive range and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and you will receive the appropriate command. the chocolate page of the toolbar is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as compressed air-archive via & kmail;. if you get a toolbar in an email, they can save it in & quantaplus; as any other backup and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the location of & quantaplus; -files placed on your system. therefore, autoconf has a number of options that can be given to the configure script. for a complete list of all options can be given. / configure --help one. the options are simple to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have trouble passing by & quantaplus; you should check if your path includes the & KDE; 3 bin folder. also you should ensure that no older version of & KDE; 3 in PATH before her bin Folder. the same applies to & Qt.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a Web development tool for KDE-surface. & quantaplus; was optimized for a rapid Web-development and combines a well-made development environment with a multitude of legacy functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While trying to create the best & HTML; -Editor, began the developers of & quantaplus; a standalone, extendable Markup-editor would be? well, this would make him completely a great web development tool for & KDE! so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to reines & HTML; restricted is & quantaplus; now close to a general and comprehensive web development system. merge: if you can define it in & XML; then you should be & quantaplus; for this the appropriate & IDE.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above mentioned above must be determined, that & quantapSaul; as a product is based on the outstanding efforts of the whole & KDE; development. & quantaplus; follows, in good application of free software, the idea of why it has been possible? thanks to the & KDE; -Gerüst is not only this everything possible, but allows users and developers, & quantaplus; to extend it to their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows web developers the use of a intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can extend the productivity dramatically. by the program compassisting them & quantaplus; expand, without yourself irgently a scripting language tax. (more about it in.)</seg>
<seg id="2111">& quanta; Plus; is a web developer environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for a quick web development and quickly expanded to a well-known editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& quanta; Plus is in no way linked with commercial versions of & quanta; the original developers left the GPL-licensed version and manufactured a commercial program.</seg>

<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high-quality product that is freely available and freely licensed projects, however, as with any open source project, the developers can always support help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; -development in financial form, they find here the way.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-made and should be filled up at the top from above downwards, since e.g. after the filling out of the project named the whole directory for the rest of the project. all these paths and author-information can be set later with Shift; F7 project project properties can be set.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project to enter, for example foo. when entering name is file automatically filled.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of & quantaplus; -project file. by default, she has the name of the project in small letters and without space with the extension of webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can access the Serveraddress of the machine, to which one wants to access local data. either a name (hostname.exempl.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>

<seg id="2161">This is the folder that will be saved in the toolbar for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbar. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of standards.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows files to add files from the local file system to the project. it can be selected multiple files or whole folder.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great, if you have static web, which you can download and change. with servertex scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Anal act if files are stored somewhere in the main folder of the project. if a project is started on new, does not attach hooks.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option all files and folder will be shown within the main folder and you can make a precise choice of manor.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This indicates a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by pressing or, by removing the herbbon, clasps out of the project.</seg>

<seg id="2179">The project management gives free access to the files in the project. there, data can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folder is also true, but are missing entries open and opening up with... in with the right mouse button-able context menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can see different profiles. the profile contains information on the site of the upload files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows the deletion of the current profile. if only there is a profile present, the button will be abused to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password is kept on core memory and is useful when programmer. this possibility is useful when most common uploading files is necessary and the rather unsecure password will be saved on the record -option not in question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transmission or simply leave dialog by changing your opinion prior to the uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus; many high-ladeprofiles can be created and so that the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when processing, or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">That is the name of the server to be copied to the files. either a fully qualified domain name or IP address.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for the uploading. the list depends on the version of & KDE; and the installed kio slaves. at least, you should choose from & FTP;, file (locally) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. normally this does not have to change, except the network administrator does not operate a service to the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your attendant, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use them according to your discretion. the password is not easy to be read, but each with programmer can be easily seen in the plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only one set of files and toolbar. it can be loaded in a project many views, i.e. by simple exchange of view can be loaded and replace several files and toolbar and replace the currently open files and toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be opened in the menu or the project toolbar, accessible via settings toolbar toolbar, opened or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantapSaul, with which one has to do most. this helps not only increase productivity but also allows adjustment of & quantapr.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above are a toolbar in & quantaplus; best via the menu toolbar. use and Adding differ. the Adding of toolbar is treated in the section Adding of toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and the symbols can be prepared either by the context menu (right-click on the toolbar, there can be other actions like a toolbar, toolbar or toolbar, where can be specified in dialog box where actions can be visible on this or other workings.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to a action (icon) on a toolbar, in addition the entries will remove and action have been edited, the self-made.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbar and the actions on them can be set in the menu with settings toolbar... and settings promotions are set..</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are in essential documents, code scams and files to linked. & quantaplus; used templates such as a common file system with extendable organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or each of the system existing directory in the storage room. templates have to be found in & quantaplus; in some of the restrictions you put in the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions at the beginning of each template, the conditions used before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all, which is not purer text. it can be added any file except text, so pictures, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc; binary. some examples can be used in documents using a global templates. further information about Templates tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created from any text document. on basis of these templates can be created new documents. usually, special rumors for the purpose and organizes the work in an appropriate manner to be efficient. some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates. see for more information about Templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">These types of templates is useful when not a new document based on a template but the same text area can be added again into the documents. you can find everything from a comment on a final test system on Javascript or Perl base. some examples are listed under global templates. see for more information about Templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, serve these templates for whole websites as templates. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarised in a compressed air archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design an documentation for Belieben (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and choose File As a template, save as local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once the done is, notice that (even if it was visible as a project model) which is visible not in the project tree. look at the predisposition under the project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Choose text in your document and click on file as a template</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be used only in a suburb. it can be used all file management functions, such as ornamental and distractions or inserting through the file tree of conqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can select a folder on the right side or in the project files with a folder on the right and site template, select a name for template and secure. by default is secured in the project folder, but of course it can be saved as local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very target-oriented advance. you can insert headlines and footlines, or dynamically with & PHP; design, files to insert files or associated with them. in addition, you can keep some things in touch of templates in projects very profound.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The storage structure in the underwindow templates is based on the $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / Templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / Templates. each of this folder corresponds to one of four types of tank, as above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To set the behavior of a folder calendar with the right mouse button click on the folder and select the context menu features. the following dialogue appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection range with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is deposited as soon as Elteral attributes is halted.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and pinch for everything except the regular folders in the board survey. if a regular folder would be disable in this path, except they would be explicitly activated. in the event of a normal folder, the flowerah would appear to something like text tree. if nothing appears, one is probably in a regular folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows modification or verified text for templates in this folder. this could be general headlines or footlines for all templates for a specific project and allows head of ingredients for a folder with special headlines / footlines.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you are using the context menu (to show right mouse button) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; -Editor and VPL; & HTML-Editor, which contains over the menu view. the first mode replaces the source Editor by the VPL; -Editor and the two-window shares the editing window into two parts: the source code and the VPL; -Editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; -Editor works as follows: he invites you a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor. then you can edit and when needed to source code editor in which the changes in the VPL; -Editor can be visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; -Editor on a document, which contains & PHP; it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; -Editor. to edit this directly with the VPL; -Editor, is continue to edit this directly with the VPL; -Editor, is continue to edit this directly with the VPL; -Editor. there is no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works exactly as the first, except that at the same time the changes in the source code as well as in the VPL; -Editor will be visible and the cursor in the source code and in the VPL; -Editor is already active, the keypress of a window to others, whereby the position in the document is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; -Editor and the source code is adjustable via settings Quanta. after selection of VPL; -View you can also choose between synchronisation according to a click or automatically. in principle the recommendation: a small spanne for fast computer and a big spice for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, it is possible to select the title of the website, so the processing of invisible tags at work with the VPL; -Editor is also created, as soon as a new document with the VPL; -Editor is created. this means the reduction of the suspended codip.</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta-tags lists the storage of information via the document itself. Meta-elements can be added by pressing the two buttons below. a click into the list allows modification of the contents, e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword on the contents column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS-rules are the new way of design of the configuration of pages within the browser. you can add CSS-rules with the buttons below to the list or delete. a change on the list is exactly as in the meta-elements. the processing of CSS-rules are currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS-style model by pressing on the file-open button and select the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the cursor is as in a text processing, possible with the arrows, possible. under rare circumstances the shortcut appears as usual. text can be inserted as usual. text can be inserted by typed or remove bunkers.</seg>
<seg id="2225">The Inserted tags will be done in the same way through the toolbar editor, as in the source Editor, made. it is to be noted that the Inserted tags in previously already existing identifying tags, e.g. if a anchor day, surrounded with text, every other surrounding anchor day will be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbar such as the tables assistant or the lists assistant are disabled. you will be later in & VPL; work, in this release you have to use tables or lists toolbar.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to the same. why so & kdiffuse 3;? let me explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The interviewer was very complicated because one of the examples had corrected many changes at the same time. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result were numerous conflicts throughout the interaction.</seg>
<seg id="2283">That used by me, I only showed me the modified lines, but I could not see what exactly in this line had changed. and there was no evidence on the places where he may only be changed into action. the merging of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">So this was the beginning. the first version of & kdiffuse; could display differences within one line and changes to white signs. later another lot of other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">If you want to compare for example quickly, simply copy it into the clipboard and add it to one of the same window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function which made a lot of work was the same and merging of folders. this function turned into diffuse & kdiffuse; nearly in a fully worthless file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way interplay will fully supported. this is useful when two people work independently of a piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps to edit the outcome. in this editor lets you edit the result even directly. the screenshot shows three quell files when connecting:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiffuse; helps you also perform at the same and merging complete folder. this screenshot shows & kdiffuse; in the folder guide:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiffuse; displays the exhalted differences and causes the possibilities of current color monitors. if you often have to check Kode, you will like this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabulators are visible visible. if lines differ only in a certain number of white signs, one can see a look at the summary in column on the left side. (no hassles) if Jemand the regation changes.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">When a file is equal, and the other is different in a row then the color indicates that file is different. red color means that both can differ files.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files are the same name, but in different folders, then you can make yourself the Tipparenteit by simply complete the file name of the first file completely. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Non-diffuse 3 folder, folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The open dialog enables the manual and select file name, select the selection via the file browser (file...) or selecting an most recently opened file from the list box. you do not need to specify the file for C; if you leave the entry for C empty, the analysis of differences with two files will be done.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the knob folder... you can also select a folder, the duplication or combination of folders will be selected, for B and C, but a folder, then used & kdiffuse; the filename from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If you have crossed the input field, the input field for target is active and can be able to deal with it. however, it is not necessarily required to set up an output file. you can also get this step later in memory.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with settings. here you can specify options before you begin with the same / coaches.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text compare. & kdiffuse; allows you to select text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. in the open dialog, you do not need to select files, you can close the dialog with the break-button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use Zipped and distraction: drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let him drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What thought is behind? sometimes a file contains e.g. several similar functions. if you want to find out how to create these functions, this would be a relatively large effort. you would need to compare two corresponding files, they in & kdiffuse. now, you can simply copy the relevant sections simply copy, and then compare.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you can draw nothing from & kdiffuse; only the expiry of text into a comparison window will be supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors may interpret the accordion and derives from text into another program as cutout and insert (instead of copying and inserting). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text pane. the Info-line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (if the path to a file is too long, you leave the mouse a while on the line. then a small aid window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source players are the letters A, B and C. a has the colour blue, B the colour green and C is Magenta. (these preferences may be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is recognized, one sees on the colour, which file is different. if both are different files, the preset color is particularly useful when you compare three files. this is in the next section (contexts).</seg>
<seg id="2306">Links next to the text is the summarizing column. if differences were found, the column indicates the corresponding color. when differences in white signs is not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + +, e.g. are white character only in character chains and comments, for the preprocessor and in a few, rare individual cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line that separates the table column from the text, where the respective source file has no lines. if the line-file is not activated, the line is shown on the surrounding lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (under the same output) also has a info-line with the wording output:, the filename and [changed] if you have been edited the result. usually it contains due to the automatic contexts already text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! to all conflicts dissolved, is the storage disabled!!! (use the buttons springed to the next clipped / unresolved conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparisons are used, each difference is also a conflict that has to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking on the return column in one of the window, the first line of the group will be shown in all windows, and the first line of the group will not be visible.) This group will then be the current group. it is highlighted with the color wallpapers for the current area and each of the left appears a black beams.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes it remains to be left through the automatic contexts or select no further line in the group; no line in the source; it's only one note for the event that you can change your opinion and perhaps another source. this text does not appear in the final file, nor in a markings that you might want to copy and elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; however, however, in the clipboard, however, in the clipboard, if you copy such text from the result window. go carefully with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if by selecting the sources the options ignore or Ignoriere C / C + + comments are enabled, changes in numbers or comments also be treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigates mainly linked to the image and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard on the left, right, runter, side, runter, side, finish, rg-beginning and Strg end, Siw as you can also use it from other programs. the overhaul column next to the vertical image bar can also be used either.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the eye window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. with the inserting button, you can switch between inadd and overwrite mode. (preset is the injuodus.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summarizing columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group (as already in the section and the editable window is explained).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (string erupward) or to the next / vored conflict (string erupward) or to the next / vored conflict. therefore, it has to be solved automatically after the manual. therefore, it has to be distinguished between resolute and odd conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marking into the clipboard, you must copy the Copper -Knopf (Ctrl-C or strg-inserting). if this is enabled, you automatically copy the manual automatically to the clipboard and the manual copying. be careful, as you could easily overwrite the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Start-end systems are stored according to the basic operating system. Unix-versions use a line-set-character\, and Win32-based systems.\ r\. KDiff3 keeps the line application of source files, therefore you should use & kdiffuse; also not using binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of last used files will be automatically saved and recovered in the next start. (menu Adjusting - &gt; KDiff3).</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a font with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog displays the dialog with variabler width to choose from, you should not use this but not.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you activate this option are differences in cursiver script. if the chosen font does not support this presentation, does not happen at all.</seg>
<seg id="2324">In systems with just 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be shown. on these systems the knob set is automatically an odd color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is activated, when the switch of the tabulator button will be inserted in the appropriate number of spaces. otherwise, a tabulator is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When you enter or return, the entry of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is activated, each selection is automatically copied to the clipboard. the manual copy into the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line type you prefer to save. the default value is the generally common selection on the used operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">While the comparisons of files tries & kdiffuse; first, all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step, white signs can be ignored. in this step, white signs will not be ignored. even while the merger will not be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (in some systems) save a wagenstire label '\' at the end of a line, other again store only a newline label '\'. usually ignored. if this option is activated, but like a white sign. during the merger, this option must be disabled. during the preset this option is disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis are numbers and related signs ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are still displayed, but they are treated as white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In the default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated as changes in white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensive for even smaller differences. the option is activated in default. it is effective with complicated and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the automatic mode, this attitude determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next unresolved conflict is going forward.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Resolves automatic all conflicts in white signs using the chosen file as a source. (default is manual.) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important. please note that the automatic selection also have conflicts in numbers or comments, if the options ignore or Ignoriere C / C + + -comments are enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are treated in the chapter on scanning of folders and perform a clapping. look for details under documentation to directory comparison and interviewer.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and already an older version exists, then the original version is attached to the Suffix .orig. if already such a backup file is deleted with the Suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Fits the language of the UI. the change of this option does not affect the current program. you need to finish & kdiffuse; (this option is in the KDE version of & kdiffuse; not available because the language is set by global through the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set for each entry separately. if you use this option, the above setting will be used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">For encoding fields for coding the coding appears a short note what the local coding is. (this can not be changed here and has purely informal nature.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. that affects how special signs are treated and interpreted as the coding for each file can be individually adjusted, even files can be compared with different coding and combined.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding is to be used.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define the processing machine, they might not work with your codec. (e.g., your files can be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-machine error can be used only with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option one can specify the coding of the output of pre-processing errors.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to suppressions of changes in white characters in the text or overview. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments, if the options ignore or Ignoriere C / C + + -comments are activated.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available when you compare three files. in normal mode, all the differences in a coloured floating column is shown. but sometimes you might just want to see the differences between two of three files. according to the selection of A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C is displayed next to the normal still a second overs column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen rather for long lines. you simply use the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Sorts the comparisons door to each other or overother. this can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and then opt out to perform the files. a simple click starts. a simple click starts to start the merger and use the file name for the output file. (if this function is used to start the assemble again, then the name of the last used will be maintained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file it will be transferred to the external command. in & kdiffuse; then the output of the command will be visible, and not the file itself. you can use your own preprocessor that you can cut your own preferences. you can use this function e.g. to cut disturbing parts or to correct the retion.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file it is transferred to this external command first (see above), then the output of the command will be used only when you start page. you can write your own preferences. each input row must have a corresponding edition line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to facilitate the user more flexibility when making the diff results. however, most users want to program the good program, however, most good news is not sufficient. the good news is that in most cases sed or perl completely.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processing commands to convert the input into large letters: SED's /\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ '\' s.\\ 1 in the default string. the\\ U shifted the found text in big letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other versions control system\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\' before the $is needed because $a special sign and end of the line would mean.</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed experiment, you might start to understand it and perhaps like this regular expressions even. they are very useful because there are many programmes which can support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The Ignatify of numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example of a further pre-out depressed for linect. sed 's / [0123456789.-] / / g' Each character between '[' and ']' is a hit, and each one is replaced by nothing, so practically deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several items on once. then you can use the Semikolon ';' to separate the compositions from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed sed, you can also use something different such as perl. perl -p -e 's / REGEXP / Resting / switches' allergies are at perl some details. where sed\\ (and\\) needs perl only (and) without the preset\\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after normal Preprocessor will be kept for the display and the interplay. further operations only changes the data that sees the start of the start of the line of Lagograms.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal preprocessor, the start-processor is the output of the regular processor.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The processor commands may be very useful, but as with every function, the text changes or differences hidden, you may not notice certain differences and destroy in the worst case important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmers to work in a folder many files. for this reason you can compare with & kdiffuse; complete folder reitalic and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes for each object a suggestion for the interaction; you can adjust the suggestion before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the intersimulate and shows the simulated changes without being carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2364">... performs selected actions either with all (F7 button), or just with the selected objects (F6 button),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is the same and merging of single files very similar. you just need to open folder on the command line or in dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folder will be merged, then folder 1 as a base is used. if no target is specified, is used & kdiffuse; folder 3; folder 3.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically start, do not start the merging. to start the assembling, you must choose the appropriate menu entry or press the F7 button. (more details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While the folder you read a small follow-up windows about the current progress. if you cancel the scanning of the folder, only the files are listed, which are compared to that.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When the scanning of the folder is completed, shows & kdiffuse; a light window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder that was found during the scan will be displayed here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is normally performed together. you can use a folder by clicking on the + / - or by clicking the arrow buttons for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions all subdirectories, and all subdirectories with which you can hold all the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double click on a file, the file is started immediately and it appears a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">When the file type is different in the other folders, then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detailed window to the selected object. in such a case the merger will be automatically selected. when the merger will be started, you will be informed about problems of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the above picture, the columns are used in the columns A / B / C the colours Red, Green, Yellow and Black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In identical records, the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folder are regarded as identical if your overall content is identical. then we also have folder the same color. with folders, age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colours reflect the colors of a leaflet which is only green, then yellow will and later, when it is old, red becomes.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, delete the goal if it exists)</seg>

<seg id="2401">Only files that fit on the indicated patterns are displayed in the element tree. separate the patterns with a semicolon;. valid location: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folder must not correspond to this pattern.</seg>

<seg id="2403">Files and folder that correspond to this pattern, are not displayed in the element tree; you can use the Semikolon; as dividers. valid holder: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that are also ignored by CVS. many autmatically products are ignored by CVS. the great advantage is that this folder can be adjusted with a .cvignore file. (look at info: / CVS / cvignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some files, files a Versions are attribute. in other filesystem. this option allows you to decide whether these files are displayed in the elementary tree or not. this option is switched in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">When links to files: if the option is outdated, symbolic shortcuts are compared. if the option is switched, the files are compared to which the links show. this is in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">When links to folder: if the option is switched, the links will be switched as normal folder and recursively searches. (note that & kdiffuse). a link to a folder of a link to yourself would be displayed and & kdiffuse;) This option is deprecated in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file by and displays statistics columns, unsober and white conflicts.) The full analysis is slower than an easy binary analysis, and much slower if they are used on files that does not contain any text. (give an appropriate anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folder over a long network, it might be compared faster, just the change date and the file size. however, you can use a certain level of security. please be used with caution. this option is in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to trusting the changement. there is no real comparison instead. the files are considered equally big. this can be useful when copying the change date. please be used with caution. this option is in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates the synchronizing mode when two folder are compared and no target may be selected. in this mode, the proposals are identical to the merger, including the results of the merging of files are stored in both folders. this option is stored in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of the merging the copy of the newer file as action. (this is considered as unsure because it will not be modified that the other file has not been modified. you should be switched in any case.) This option is switched in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder will be replaced or deleted, then the original backup copy and receives the original backup file with the .orig -enlargement already exists, this is also the normal merging of individual files, not only the contexts folder. this option is switched in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally the folder will remain visible; you can switch the window bases with the mouse. if you do not want to switch the window directory with the mouse. if you do not want to switch the option List & text windows share the main window in the window and switch off by changing between directory & text windows between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double-click. however, you can also launch a single file or run directly, without the folder file. once you save the result, the status will be put on done and the file will not be merged once you start the folder compress.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status is however lost if you read the directory once again: directory -menu: new to read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparent with the help of KIO-slaves. KDiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way you can specify files and folder for opening, which are on local or remote hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line contains a local file with one on an FTP server. the second command line contains a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as a local files and folder. some things should you consider:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively undly. or.., which is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special sign must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, whitesp- &gt;% 20, etc.). for example has a file with the name / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the filesystem on the server, sometimes connected by the protocol. it follows a brief list of constraints:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it may not be differed if a link indicates a file or folder. then one file is accepted as a link destination. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit, justifications or change date. therefore, the justifications or the change date from the original. (note the option trusting the size.) (This is only available on local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main point of use is currently as differences-spectator in KDevelop. KDevelop starts first always the built-built differences, press KDiff3, press the right mouse button above the differences spectator and then select in KDiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Usually requires & kdiffuse; two full input files. if it is used as a checkout file, takes & kdiffuse; the names of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then, & kdiffuse; the program patch can restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the conqueror you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - KDiff3Part. also, please note that this does not work if any of the original files exists. in addition, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since generating the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiffuse; as a part, it only supports the comparisons of two files, a very small toolbar and menu. the merging or the same of folders is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now Heist there are compare) there are already. in addition, the name KDiff3 already indicates that it can be merging like the program diffuse of the diffusion tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I use GPL programs already very long and have learned a lot by taking into the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all the programmers who have gone the way or they are going to go so.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program from the sources and the configure script probably not forwarded to the right prefix for KDE. in the default configure command in / usr / local, but then KDE can't find the resources for the user interface (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find further information on this subject.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white signs is different, these lines are treated as identical; but if only a non-white sign differently, the line is treated as not identical. if, lines of next to each other, this is is coopbut this section.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor reigns for each difference in the files where it starts and where he ends. that's necessary to resolve a conflict simply by clicking on the source code and execute the button A / B / C, and it is too much effort to design which this information could be saved.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort was so far too big. you can recover a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C. to process larger quantities of text should be used to use a different editor.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt: no src linearnestles; published and the text does not delete. what does this mean and how can it be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiffuse; use already many colors to highlight of differences. even more floating would be confusing and lacks the purpose. use it to another editor.</seg>

<seg id="2444">Cut (Strg-X or remotif) copied into the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert the text from the clipboard at the current state-position and replacing the current markings.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences in all folders are identical in all folders are not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current version, you will need to reread the folder to these options the folder with the function.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries shown to identify the differences. this also performs so that identifier files can not be copied in the destination folder. if the target folder will not already be changed in the target process. (the behavior is probably changed in a later program version.) This option is outdated in the default version.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to choose from the source with the certificate A, B and C below the menu bar. if you are attached to one of the buttons below (if they are not already present). if the lines are already present, they will be removed at the button on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In the default, this option is disabled. underground differences in each character (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & kpager; displays a Miniature of all virtual working spaces. it is quite practical to change the current programs on the desktop to change their size, to finish or move it. this works both within a working area and at several times.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & kpager; can display all virtual desktop areas as well as the current applications. applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, window can be moved within & kpager; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and other workspaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: if on the empty background of & kpager; then click on an application within & kpager; and terminate the context menu and the name of the application as well as the entries minimize, maximize, On the desktop and terminate the commands:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizing the application window on the full size of the desktop. appears only when on an application was clicked.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Send the application to select virtual desktop. appears only when on an application was clicked.</seg>

<seg id="2460">If this field is attracted, the current programs will be displayed as a small window at the & kpager; other at the next time you will be shown only the empty spaces to make their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the programmer window is selected. simply shows a simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. symbol symbolises the window with its standard symbol and Pixmap shows a small view of the real programmer. remark: Pixmap is recommended only for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here, the order of the & kpager; -Hauptfensters are determined: classically safe & kpager; in some other windowers; waist shows all virtual desktop areas in some other wind management; waist in a vertical row, which is very good for the presentation side on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager Miniprogram in the inspection bar. it has the advantage that he can display in size, the windows can display as symbols or with its content and can move it outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right mouse button within & kpager; and subsequent evaluation of switch-switch... lets the dialog appear to appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">At the moment, this cannot be changed in dialog settings. you can manually complete this:</seg>

<seg id="2483">In the default configuration, it might be enlarged; the area around the mouse cursor is like a movable touch. alternatively, you can also arrange a select screens in the larger window (selection pane) or the environment of the mouse cursor to the screenshot (eg; on the left screen).</seg>

<seg id="2485">In the selection mode, you can adapt the selection window to your own needs. you can change it with the arrow and the masts and change its size. this can be done in the following ways:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse cursor into the magnification window and keep the left mouse button so you can get the contents of the magnification code and move it. this also goes with the arrow buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you are in addition to the & Shift; taste or use the & MMB; use the drop window move.</seg>
<seg id="2488">This combination allows you to change the size of the selection window. please note that the upper left corner of the selection pane are firm and only to move the lower right corner.</seg>

<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it may be necessary to reduce the answers times by & KDE; in case of sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of what places a mouse click without effect: the Click on the neutral components of windows or on positions in the browser window that does not represent any link. you can park the mouse in such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse rucked, you should normally clean your mouse. this is usually pretty simple. the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball-clean, but also the roles, which come with the mouse ball in touch.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First, you have to take out the mouse ball. as that happens, is of mouse to mouse. it should be quickly clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have the ball, you would have to see the roles. these are on the sides of the Loches into which the ball was used. the dirt and the dirt can easily scratched with a flat blade or the fingers.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system breaks the execution of & kmousetool; when it's just started a move-off. if you use in this case the smart foretool means that the surgery is no longer by the slogan of the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; under another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution to this problem is that you run yourself a mouse click. here, the status of & kmousetool; return and you can work as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to take mouse clicks and puts the cursor to another point.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor to the cursor where you want to have it. however, a hard drive of mouse clicks. so you can not cause any keystory reactions. so, a hard drive for the mouse shocks are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the titles of windows.</seg>

<seg id="2522">Use the smart forwarding not when you just start to start & kmousetool; select text instead, lead you at an end of the text range, and keep the move mouse button while you move the mouse cursor to the other end of the text and then click the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. thus, each time is compressed, when & kmousetool; so you know exactly when at smart forging the shifting time. later you can use the intelligent delay even without the audible mouse click. but that requires some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; use the Xtest extension for & X Window; it should be installed on most system already.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available when the system has a soundcard and speaker and this correctly is set up.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to mark text for the control of voices, the volume, of gender voice and the tape. moreover, brands for the control of the arrangement of for example abbreviation. SSML is part of the VoiceXML specification, a further W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently, SSML only supports part and only in basic functions. the following constraints are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You must install the Rab _ diphone voice (Britical male) as this is the default voice, the festival available in the output from SSML.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and typing filters (SDB filter). thus, the first set of syntheticizes, since only the first set of synthetization must start, not the whole text order. therewith, you can also stop on the ticket orders either by or withhold and break, even if the voice synthesizer this is not directly supported.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you can see the typing marginal filters. at the first start of & ktts; will automatically be set up. you can change its settings or add additional typing filters, but let's get out of it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Most easiest, you will learn the setup of the Speech selection by means of try. place your spokesperson online, change some features and check out how the selection of Speaker may have changed. so you need to have more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then quicker can begin with reading, since only the first sentence has to be processed and not the whole texblock, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then keep an orders on the box card or cancel the card, even if the voice synthesizer this feature is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons the normal Satzenometrifugation will automatically start when you are kttsmgr to the first time. he cannot be removed, just remove nothing at this filter, unless you know what you do.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Satzenerkennungsfilters compare text with a regular expression for statutes and add a spulator sign (deculator) before filtering automatically removed from the text). notice that the standard sign-border filter filter the character sets.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD-filters will never be applied to & KDE; -News (otify), warnings, messages or issue of Screen-Readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed from verse the normal typing filters, you can insert it again by entering it in & ktts; enthrene file standard _ sbdrc.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the map options, you can write the Sprechering for the application. the card map is displayed when</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the chief on the cartone card). in other words, there are no speaker properties.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the fitting Interphone, which indicates all the characteristics of the intercom function. if you choose the settings of the microphone or edit, select & ktts; these speakers shall elect & ktts; the speaker, which meets the original characteristics of the original characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the choices.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Choose the characteristics of the desired microphone. if this property does not play a role, simply enter nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Select this section if the property should have priority over other properties. you can also set several markers here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor when entering the issue is, this property is rarely use. the only case, if you might want to specify this property. the only case, if you possibly want the attribute language, lies before you know that a certain application text in another language as being included in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all properties in the area of speakers, the most important to delete, click the default speakers and then use the speaker, who corresponds to the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 is required for the last text contract in the queue. you can also specify a order number (without order number, input 0 required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr immediately overthrew when it started. I used Debug support, but I do not get any refund.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Gstreamer is deducted and & ktts; probably you have to register Gstreamer still register. at Gstreamer 0.8.x is the command GST-register-0.8. if the problem is not solved, maybe a non-compatible version of Gstreamer. you can attempt to update or uninstall Gstreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio handover via ALSA is not working when I play at the same time with another application music. if I have a text order, freezes & ktts; a message on the & console; appears a message, that is said: destroy to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system there is the problem that conflicts in ALSA occur that prevent a simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices. notes for possible solutions can be found on the website of the ALSA-Project (dmix) on www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I have downloaded an additional voice for the festival from the internet. I have installed them and can use them in the festival, but kttsmgr will not show this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Add the new voice in the file $KDEHOME / share / apps / kttsd / festivalint / Voices can serve you with the other entries. if that is successful, please send a patch along with the & URL that you have found the voice to have the developers.</seg>
<seg id="2751">On the map of the card audio there is a setting speed. so that this works, the program must be installed and installed via the ambient-variable PATH. some synthesizer modules like the map coordinates a adjustment for speed on. depending on the chosen voice is this active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the autospeed are ignored if & ktts; & HTML; prereads, SSML has own tags, with which the speed is controlled.) Deactivate either the filter for the conversion of & HTML; by & XML; (see) or, if you are quite mud, change the .xbox file of & HTML; -to-SSML application, and put the intercom speed.</seg>

<seg id="2834">The installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users. it is simply the rpm package and in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool can be used with graphic user as a package or the installation tool of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case, the installation of Qt and & KDE is not necessary, but in addition, the development packages with libraries and other things are required.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This will only be experienced users. it is not difficult, & knetworkconf; to compile. the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information on basic networks are given in the second, all of & knetworkconf; variable configuration files discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area can not replace more knowledge about IP networks. in this Annex you can only replace basic information on the integration of the PC into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never developed large spread. from IPv6 is expected that it focuses on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the note that IP address is authorized to use a network interface. in foreign networks, on & eg; workplace is the network administrator to the contact point, which can be used by a valid IP address. in any case, DHCP can not be chosen arbitrary.</seg>
<seg id="2842">When put your own little (home) networks the IP address should be selected from a specially designed for this purpose to avoid IP address contacts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded, therefore its any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be made possible by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">Smaller networks are mostly used in the range of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 x 192.168.1.254. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the network maske is set mostly on 255.255.255.0, so all your machines are included in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first one is the so-called Standard route, the second is the Loopback-address (localhost = the own computer). the standard route is required for IP redirecting.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The mains address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in local own machine. normally the address is assigned to 127.0.0.1 an own so-called Loopback interface that works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part there are the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf; and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file sometimes is dynamically changed at DSL connections, so that it was not surprised if in case of active DSL connections to find another content than specified there.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is random by scripts in SuSEconfig. another level as expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for Bandages on the basis of tar. it offers the ability to create multiple archives on a tape. the first place was to provide a surface for tar to restores the ability of dds2tar to the fast, selective unpack. the second goal was to answer a question, who made my wife: how much longer takes it to secure?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a band may be used, it must be of & kdat; it can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; spult the band back and reads the pre-thrilling information of the bandes. recognizes & kdat; the precipitation on the band will not be asked if the band shall be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognises & kdat; the prespann, is looking for the appropriate index on your plate. can this not be found, you will be asked if the Bandindex is to be created.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly that the band is involved in the tape work, to view that the band is involved. in the status bar appears a corresponding message. the content of the player can now be searches for the band.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before the throw of the bandes, first of all, the integration must be resolved. there are three methods to achieve this.</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; indicates a change of the symbols for the band that the involvement of the band has been resolved and indicates the status bar. the band can now be extended without any risk.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a band of & kdat; be used, it must be formatted by & kdat;</seg>
<seg id="2901">A Bandana must be formatted before you can't use this process. this process corresponds to the formatting when using & kdat; it has to be done before you can form the band of & kdat; can be formatted by the tape of & kdat. floppy disks are usually not a formatting of the bandes ahead, DAT-drives, however not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the bandname and the capacity drives & kdat; with the formatting of the gang. all data on the tape will be lost! after completion of formatting, the band will be integrated automatically and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you encounter the backup process, you need to select the securing files. this can be done on three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. it is only saved to this file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backup profile in the tree. it will only be backed the files specified in the profile.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the so marked file and / or subfolder are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select to the menu Seats...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been initiated, the dialog opens up for backup. in this dialog, you can even examine the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you have confirmed the settings, the dialog will appear. the dialog displays the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in an der Archive in the entry for the drive. it will be tested only the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a tick. it will only be tested the selected files and / or subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Click with right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu item....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test process was started, the dialog will appear for verification. in this dialog you can even check your selection and change the work folder for the review.</seg>

<seg id="2915">Before you can direct the reproduce, the files must be restored, the files will be checked, highlighted. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives, which belong to the entry for the bandage. it will be restored only the selected file or subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the desired files from one of the archives with a tick. there are only the selected files and / or subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Click with right mouse button on a file or folder in one of the archives and select menu.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process started, the dialog will appear for restoring. in this dialog you can even check your selection and change the work folder for the recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the settings for the recovery, the dialogue will appear reproduce. this dialog displays the progress of the re-creation, as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it proves to be used as necessary to create the Banding file from the band's contents. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can recreate the index on two types of volume:</seg>
<seg id="2922">Here is a backup profile with the straight selected files and default settings. you can make use of the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder where the backup is to be done. the list of corresponding files will be updated automatically according to the selected working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folder that are listed under hedging files, which are only stored on the same file system, such as the folder. folder that are installed on other file systems, you can use separately below backup files. each entry is viewed by tar independently from the other.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files are changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file will be secured. it will only be backed the files that have been changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before the call of tar. this causes that all files will be backed up and a new snapshot file is set up for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of buttons files & gt; and lt; and lt; files was not completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can set you via the menu item KDat... in the Settings Settings. the following settings can be made:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path to the device _ device (usually / dev / Tape). this path must refer to the non-revocation version of the band.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Is this setting actively, transmitated & kdat; before the band is integrated the command to load to the drive. in some drives this is necessary before reading or reoperations.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Is the option switched, try & kdat; to unlock the throw in the Bandages. possibly this attitude does not work with all the Bandages.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched, is automatically rejected by dissolving the integration of & kdat; automatically use this option not in Floppy streams.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Is the option switched, try & kdat; the hardwarn blockage for the bandage force. no matter if this setting is active or not, you need to be & kdat; in any case the blockage for your bandage.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a band formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the player. this file should only be bypad on the tape. the contents of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(N bytes) The band-ID. the format of this character is invoicing: seconds, with invoicing the full name of the system is, on which the band was formatted. seconds is the number that has passed since the epoch in which the band has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band-ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar -archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work, as long as it is not about incremental fuses.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a hedging. this symbol is only active if a band is integrated.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & KDE; -viewers for system protocols. the program is available for unexperienced users where you can obtain information about your system or where the system allows for example to access information about problems that appear on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users to understand what your computer is in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for unexperienced users where you can obtain information about your system or where the system matches the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users the fast access to information about problems that appear on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore tries to provide some advanced functions, with their help the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 features & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other features are also included in addition and will be explained in the further captions of this handbook.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screenshot, presents & ksystemlog; functions at your disposal, with their help, the individual protocol lines of a protocol-file can easily filtering and sort out the individual possibilities to sorting and filters will be shown in the next chapter of this handbook.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start, & ksystemlog; first started the most important protocol-file system - the system protocoll - this will not be displayed, and it opens up instead of its a small post-system windows. the protocol files can be found under Linux normally in the folder / var / log, for the normal user usually no permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filtering option to filter after a selected criterion. the list of log files will be displayed automatically. in the default configuration contains the selection range next to the filter the entry. then there will be a protocol-line only displayed in one of the columns of the filter pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can of course choose another entry at this point. select the character string. select the column process in accordance with selected column, and carry it in the filtering the name of a process, so shows you & ksystemlog; all the protocol lines which have been sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is activated in the default configuration and helps you to detect the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level errors are shown with a striking ligent colour as a protocol lines of the Level note. the colored representation of protocol-lines can be folded.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Would you like to show a certain process (e.g. in the system protocoll or in the Cron protocol), so you can hide the process-identification (PID) in the column process. this can be useful for example if you would like to examine the output of a certain commands, such as the start of the samba server. in this case you use the filename.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can jump the option to display new lines in the context menu of the main menu to show all new in the next record lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows you to use multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open extra windows and manage your window, select a protocol to display.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. Dort you will find more information about the sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; you can also find in the following folder of & KDE; -Subversion Archives: ksystemlog; in & KDE; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to the & KDE; System V init editor, rather well known (and in the following also as named) as & ksysv;. this section leads to a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V init develops rapidly to the standard for the control of the program restarts when uptake the system in the & Linux; and therefore, because it is easier to use, powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go on to historical aspects (e.g. because I know nothing: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init-binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important, because maybe someone might try to adjust a machine to System V init without a new installation and reformatting. therefore, you need to be safes that the old init was removed from there when there was there one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV init also differs from the BSD init that the configuration files in a subfolder from / etc are instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you can find rc.sysinit and the following additional folder:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. generally you need a script for each system service, you do not include such things such as network, NFS, & mailmail;, httpd & etc; Systemservices do not include such things such as setserial, which will only be started. such views belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local it should lie under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems possess this file, even though there is not much use for it. you can also want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run out something, which has to do with the serial connection.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is looking for different positions of the program init and starts the first one that he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard Runtime is in / etc / inittab. you should see in the initial range as the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look at the second column and probably notice that the preset Runtime 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can perform / etc / inittab from hand and adjust the 3. be very careful when you have to execute the system, running the system restart and execute the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does all the right scripts do you enter into rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that in this folder does not find the right files. instead, each entry here is a link to a scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How starts and stops init actually system services? very simple: any of the scripts is so written that there are an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts actually from hand on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would keep the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one K includes, the script will be called to the argument stop. if it includes an S, the script will start with the argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people wish you a simple way to set machines for many purposes. I could have & eg; a server -Runtime, which can be run only httpd, & apmail;, network & etc. in addition, I could also have a user-Runtime, the & G; & kdm;, network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you will learn the use of & ksydra;. it should not be very difficult because the program has been created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is easy to do not say trivial: move an entry from the range of the availability system services at one of the six Runtime to start it on this level (or to stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runlevles or change the position within one level by moving it. thereby, the entry of its original Runtime (or its position) will only do when they draw an entry out of the area of the availability system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are shifted, if you select it in a new area. to select it simply to select a new Runtime or from the context menu, and in the target area, -- even then if the same entry has already exists in the target area.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an application can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case you have to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can attempt to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore entries in the trash or thrown in the trash. be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the Tabulator button to enable the different fields of work (availability system, Runtime 1 stop, Runtime 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor buttons to meet a selection of top or below the previous.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry to another Runtime (you can also move it with cut off into clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired Runtime with intrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of a contract manually, press the button button to switch the properties dialog. connect the table button to switch between different fields. connect the dialog by sending the button to accept the changes, or press Esc to dismiss the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of the data required, all entries in the menu file require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. performances, the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc). otherwise they will be saved by & ksysv; reproduced. changes to the preferences are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard runners, and now the machine starts again new. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter at the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in individual user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the standard Runtime at a reasonable value (3 should usually be in order).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for execution under Runtime X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), then you have to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way, such as system services can be started in these distributions, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution: check if all configuration files are required (and even if they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) are simply without a message when their configuration files are not provided or wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, may even be different from version to version. if you use a different distribution, please send me information about the Runtime, so that this manual can be added.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the user and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To begin with & kuser; start it is sufficient, the chapter adaptation of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Once you have made changes, you need to save it. either you use the appropriate icon of the toolbar or the entry store in the menu file.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two card maps, the user and the user reviews. to edit the desired users or the desired group with a double-click on the entry. it appears the dialog user and group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some card cards are shown only if you have extended system settings, if you have extended system settings, on which you can make individual settings, if shadow, or for example / etc / master.passwd like in BSD / master.passwd.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card-card management appears, if shadow, or for example / etc / master.passwd as in BSD -Unixes are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card-card appears only if for at least an embedded filesystem (Quota) is activated and initialized is (recognizable at the file quotiuser / quota.group on the file system). here you can be modified for each user parameters, whereby the restrictions are stored in KB as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be individually adjusted for each file system. the current file system is selected using the field of filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The card details informs groups informed about the group members of the selected users. the standard group, to which the user belongs, you can find in the primary primary group. furthermore, the user can be member in other groups by using these in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog features of the group contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or a group, select Adding from the menu users or group or click the fitting Adding button. the Edit or deletion of the selected users or the selected group works similar.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO-Bootmanager, remove the bootpasswort, remove the time until the boats of the standard operating system, remove the default operating system, remove operating systems, remove, change and more.</seg>
