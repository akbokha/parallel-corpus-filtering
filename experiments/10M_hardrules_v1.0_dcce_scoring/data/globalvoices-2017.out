although I had attended the USA since 2012 at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is tremendous .
as many of my generation I grew up with American films , American authors have read and operated his sport .
in fact , this land had a very profound impact on me that I was mainly because of an American film journ@@ alist .
as a 14 @-@ year I played the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y gran@@ des in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fur@@ ious rep@@ lic@@ ted con@@ spir@@ acy of an oil @-@ Magn@@ um , which were the top of the con@@ spir@@ ited with judges who were interested .
I was caught .
free to Method Man , &quot; me was &apos;s as if the absolute truth is , Verg@@ iss everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the US had even more ampli@@ fied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always said , &quot; America is the only country in which I ever lived , whose diversity is so welcoming , that you are always the one who you are and it &apos;s easy to find acceptance in an community of like @-@ min@@ ded people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I even had a very trag@@ ic love letter about his size .
then came Donald Tr@@ ump .
much was written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his asc@@ ension is for me as he goes with his Eng@@ dies .
he never stops with his opinion on the mountain how to say so beautiful .
he tells exactly what he thinks , such as a former colleague , and explains its cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ sive and women .
nevertheless people react to his statements and voted in favor of him .
the 13 million votes that he won in the rep@@ lic@@ ating presidential elections , the highest number that was one of the Party nom@@ inations ever reached .
I was speech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ otte person , I asked me ?
I could not ump his voters in line with people who had met me during my time during my time .
as for example , Prof. Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of the journ@@ alism program , which takes people from all over the world , a deep belie@@ ver man , with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
also un@@ anim@@ ous tr@@ umps do not look with the by Peter Bh@@ atia , the current publisher of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ atia and I had met us with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix . &quot;
Tr@@ ack@@ intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity that I lived with Sandy b@@ ahr which in fighting their lives the environment and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son .
yet it fits to the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es that always with much patience and grace to me and my colleagues helped to get used to the complexity of the American life .
then there were Andrew Bis@@ ey , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors who helped me much for my career .
these people and they em@@ bo@@ died by them deeply deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tr@@ ump his way to the nomin@@ ees rep@@ ubli@@ ican Presidency , she gri@@ ps me a h@@ alt and the n@@ ace for its limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception to the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 gave over 50 million Americans , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of its cont@@ emp@@ t towards non @-@ white people .
the examination of the idea that people for Tr@@ ump have been voted because they were either inter@@ r@@ acial or fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism or because they were prepared to over@@ look these things , broke me almost the heart .
maybe it is un@@ fair the tr@@ ump voters as a co@@ assi@@ est to call .
to put people on one of my friends , is exactly what has led us to this situation .
this is super@@ ficial and resp@@ ect@@ ful and indicates a im@@ ability to understand those who act on another way and think .
it shows the people that their worries and fears about the h@@ ectic changes in their communities are not considered .
could it be that these voters have tun@@ ed by which most knows are , for Tr@@ ump , because they would like to reg@@ ain control over a country that she has disappointed ?
in other words , they might want to say that they are still important in this America ?
perhaps .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comm@@ ented the cru@@ el decision to raise a man who look down with cont@@ emp@@ t to those who look differently from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( e.g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ el@@ ong@@ ation of the White against all other Eth@@ ics , &quot; word@@ play from black into all@@ ine to the White and whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means as much as sl@@ eu@@ der@@ trau@@ ma ) , as it was the great Van Jones pra@@ ying , exactly the killed that America has made so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people around the world appreciate the American Ideal - regardless of whether my@@ th or reality , it is still a powerful idea - what faith or background one can always have , America is called every welcome .
for this land chose as his president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose story , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
with the choice Donald Tr@@ umps there is a huge part of the white Americas of this promise and says : to hell , religious freedom and the whole concept of plur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 is the white man on the ruin , they say .
in all this I have to think about K@@ hi@@ z@@ r K@@ han , the father of a soldi@@ er who liked in Iraq , and what he said in the eve of the election .
in a manifestation for Hill@@ ary Clinton , Mr. K@@ han had a change of man with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would have my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; said Mr. K@@ han .
the crowd answered with a lau@@ t@@ strong &quot; no ! &quot;
&quot; do Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; c@@ rup@@ ts the amount .
&quot; have Lat@@ inos a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; answered it .
do A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if someone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he received a un@@ anim@@ ous and lau@@ t@@ ate &quot; no . &quot;
Mr. K@@ han completed with the words : &quot; God is thanks to Mr. Tr@@ ump , that is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was reported .
the country , for which his son was , sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ ack@@ land , said the message .
and all the people who look like Mr. K@@ han , could not find a place in this new America .
and it breaks my heart .

what did the m@@ ex@@ ual Music School of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean town Cat@@ e@@ ura together ?
that the music that is played at both places , not only the life of the children has changed , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large g@@ arb@@ age dump , just 16 Kilometers per south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city , which is very popular among tourists but worlds removed from the nearby pre@@ Colom@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for several years now the La B@@ anda de m@@ ú@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) in the municipality : one of the children and adults exist , Symphony Orchestra , which has found their music instruments a way to over@@ coming the surrounding poverty .
a music @-@ school with 100 students is for the municipality of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca to the central interest .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality that is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico is known for their drugs of drugs and the gang violence .
but changed this after a random encounter with a French pil@@ ots who started a musical project and offered the youth so a rare hop@@ eless .
the young band@@ members take their obligations to the music group very seriously , means the local press not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
once they come from the school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they carry out their big passion to deal with their great passion .
they are always laugh@@ ing and with sh@@ iny eyes and play in the Tru@@ bel you learn day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , clarinet , oboe , flute , Wald@@ horn , Pau@@ ke , B@@ ong@@ os and the Con@@ ga to play .
music from Mü@@ ll
more than 7,@@ 000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero playing the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village which is practically located above the largest g@@ arb@@ age dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paragu@@ ay capital - on instruments that are made from rec@@ ycl@@ able waste material .
music with recur@@ rent instruments , which consist of local fixed waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura where the rec@@ ycl@@ ines under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez have begun to transform into instruments into instruments .
the instruments imi@@ pr@@ ised , viola , C@@ elli , double @-@ bass , fl@@ utes , fl@@ utes , saxophone , tromb@@ ones , tromb@@ ones , tr@@ um@@ pets , tr@@ um@@ pets , tr@@ um@@ pets and percussion , which were all made of the tr@@ ash .
the reper@@ toire comprises classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ic and Latin American music as well as music of Be@@ at@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article from Los Angeles Times F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , at the first time :
first , it was very difficult because we had no room to rehear@@ s@@ als and we worked at the same place where the parents worked in the tr@@ ash . children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact their parents because many of them do not live with their children .
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something that he never had seen before : one from waste and violin .
today there is a whole orch@@ estra , playing on instruments of re@@ produced material and that is called The Rec@@ ycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentary &quot; land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic g@@ arb@@ age ) draws the musical performance on :
the world produces every year about one billion tons of tr@@ ash .
those who live with him and from him are the keys - like the people in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paragu@@ ay .
and here it turn him into something beauty .
land@@ fill harmon@@ ic follows the orch@@ estra with his inspir@@ ing spect@@ acle from tr@@ ash to music around the world .
the orch@@ estra has played his music even before Pope Francis :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these ost@@ African countries show how technology and teamwork is successful to fight fishing fishing
photo © Fish @-@ i Africa - a project that fighting the wil@@ der illegal fishing
this article , written by Emma Bry@@ ce , was originally published by En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that addresses international , practical solutions for environmental problems .
re @-@ release takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices to common use of content .
in West @-@ Africa was then known that this ship had already operated in li@@ beri@@ ic waters of illegal fishing , before it sear@@ ched the other coast of Africa .
the ost@@ African countries were thus raised over accordingly and little gen@@ eig@@ t , a law@@ less@@ ness of this kind in their coastal area .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the compress@@ ors , Mos@@ ambi@@ que and the Seych@@ elles mobili@@ zed rapidly against the ship . they den@@ ied him , one of its ports and ref@@ used to give him a fishing place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , the prime minister surrounded by countries that you simply den@@ ied all den@@ ies &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; is remin@@ ded of a team dedicated to the Ken@@ yan fishing communities . he is part of a team that discovered the ship of her period and followed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch the fish there .
ultimately it was also comp@@ elled to pay 2 million US dollars to Liber@@ ia because of pill@@ age of fish stocks .
at the core of this initiative , the criminal practices , and resources protects , Fish @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop illegal F@@ ishing ( Il@@ leg@@ ale F@@ ishing ) .
the members of this network are adjacent to Somalia and Madag@@ ascar the six countries that had been driven from their waters at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are equal and together work together . they exchange information and stand out each other when it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tr@@ us@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project En@@ ding illegal F@@ ishing . this project offers Fish @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is regulated by definition un@@ regulated : what is hi@@ d is hidden , present because of it is extremely difficult to remove it from extremely difficult fishing in the over@@ flow of regions .
through sec@@ rec@@ tive mis@@ conception of existing laws , should be protected by which certain habit@@ ats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing of ecos@@ ystems , which have a del@@ ity balance .
however , while actions against the illegal fishing industry was once ated by bureaucr@@ atic hur@@ d@@ les with the information between individual countries , so the actions can happen in real time , with trac@@ eable to Fish @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there may be the individual countries together for example lists of existing licenses , news for dig@@ est activities or details that you noticed while a harbour in@@ spec@@ tions or experienced .
Fish @-@ i pursu@@ ing the activities of ships also very attentive , if this on the open sea move , through satellite data .
this allows the authorities to meet ships that fish in Forbidden areas . also let yourself discover the sus@@ pic@@ ious ride . even such that a ship invites its folded fish on other ships .
in the ide@@ al@@ ment can show such studies if the participating ships have a fish licence , where they were traveling and perhaps also whether they have a pen@@ dic@@ ation .
countries that are concerned against illegal fishing , may refuse the acceptance of such ships in their ports . what does that ships cannot sell their charge . and that they can even forced to the numbers of pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is then a significant financial losses for the owners , which means that the illegal fishing book is financially no longer worth it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; says Per Erik Berg@@ h , leit@@ ner Director of NF@@ DS Africa . the latter is an advisory company that advoc@@ ates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports Fish @-@ i .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to gain its valued 20 million USD to lost sales , which were the eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i every year due to illegal fishermen that penet@@ rate in ost@@ African waters .
East @-@ Africa has one of the productive t@@ una @-@ fishing stores , presence because of the commercial fishing from around the world . under these also those illegal fishermen .
to their practices , including actions are like sailing under false flag , coun@@ terf@@ eit Lic@@ ence , indication of imagination , the fur @-@ protected species and the fish in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are target@@ ing the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a not complete control system &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier , a ship was illegal and a country could then say &quot; You should not walk my port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kom@@ m to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and exactly this leg@@ acy tries to close Fish @-@ i now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far the closed front works .
since its foundation was Fish @-@ i participated in more than 30 research of susp@@ ects ships .
it has been cri@@ min@@ elle networks revealed to spread the f@@ ake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several gri@@ eved identi@@ ties and found the post@@ pon@@ ed ships .
due to its cooperation with Inter@@ pol , the international authority to fight crime , Fish @-@ i Information on illegal fishing over large distances to split up and get .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our studies lead us quite far into the networks organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berg@@ h . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it builds a system , the Fish @-@ i help , sus@@ pic@@ ious ships conc@@ iser .

Fish @-@ i &apos;s Satellite system , which is always developed further , the illegal ships will be glad to hide themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Ch@@ ef@@ analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g Mat Tr@@ acking , an N@@ RO who is also concerned with fishermen data , and Fish @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships will turn off for example their automatic identification systems , which they can not be chosen by satellite it .
Cop@@ eland is therefore helping build a system that connects different information levels . it is to help to find Fish @-@ i with greater precision with greater precision .
one model programme
but can Fish @-@ i &apos;s team Afri@@ kan@@ ic nations actually affect the doubt global issue of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ wards has recently opened with Google and the marine organization Oce@@ ana opens the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch : a platform that allows the satellite display and can be shown with the position each individual trac@@ eable ship throughout the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbours to get a better picture of it who is doing - this gives simply sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to uni@@ te themselves and to stream@@ line their resources to investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should do this at global level . &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tr@@ us@@ ts has a similar project to run in which a global system allows the persecution of ships .
there are signs that Fish @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only cri@@ min@@ able , but they also cat@@ ch@@ ure .
ships that had earlier be prop@@ elled without licence , and hardly to reck@@ on with consequences , now they know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u some of the many of the Fish @-@ i participating countries now have a 33 % increase in fisher@@ y p@@ set , since then fishing boats are more licenses for sale .
after Fish @-@ i Somalia helped , Gre@@ ko 1 asc@@ ended doors , found the insp@@ ectors there on board to@@ w , whose use is prohibited .
photo with friendly permission of Fish @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also other countries notic@@ ing these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is very strong that we can now copy other countries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars annually pass through illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are in 2015 six countries together , to the aforementioned West Africa Task Force . also they fight the illegal fishing , according to the same model like Fish @-@ i@@ . &quot; with security is the goal , even more such initiatives and structures emerge in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , Fish @-@ i &apos;s younger affiliate may report his first big tri@@ umph : in October there it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship which was on under false flag . and not only was the ship with no license and were used by tu@@ to@@ w .
the ship was also penet@@ rated in Forbidden waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; with the corresponding rules against Gre@@ ko 1 set the strong sign that they go against illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berg@@ h . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Fish @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time proof that such a collabor@@ ative work method for the protection of the oceans actually works in the entire world Sea .

the Mov@@ ements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of fi@@ er@@ ce demonstrations .
they are regarded as prot@@ est against the decision of the government , the referendum in order to stop the pres@@ tige of the President Nicolás Mad@@ uro .

in other parts of the country , some prot@@ esters are to uph@@ old the police forces , including those women in the An@@ den@@ ko T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :

others evaluate these protests as a further step in the fight against a government that has undertaken a little against the devast@@ ating crisis and would prefer to have thought of critical votes :

the interview was translated into English and will be published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Perla , a secret prison in the Argent@@ in@@ ean town of Córdoba .
as meanwhile , he said Qui@@ j@@ ano now in the context of the great La Perla @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province Córdoba to his father .
in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investigated during the Argent@@ in@@ ean Military service .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not been chosen for his life .
starting at the peas@@ ant , the same name as his father contribute to the brut@@ al Mil@@ es@@ per@@ ations in the prison of La Perla , which he suffered over at the age of 15 .
34 years he kept the sur@@ ge for themselves .
in the situation back then I believed that this was fine .
I felt like a di@@ vul@@ ture .
as a child with 15 years you don &apos;t remember that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , Fol@@ ter@@ er and mur@@ derer .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ arm@@ chair from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism was his father from 1976 to 1978 dep@@ uty com@@ man@@ de@@ ur of the secret Department 141 in the prison La Perla .

no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ anos son , a man who had experienced the extent of the atro@@ cities that he had experienced as a boy , and the before a federal court said against his own father .
his story shows , which big power has a parent and how this child has chosen a way of rede@@ mption .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went with us in the sports hall . there I had myself with a boy , the mar@@ tial arts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all called him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I told my father of him and some days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and called me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
you are a ar@@ stri@@ l , you have dre@@ amed you with one of the ERP .
pass just on that they do not lead you one day and I must save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito revolutions from ario del Pueb@@ lo , - revolution@@ aries folk army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers in Argentina .
therefore he offered me to go back into the sports hall . some days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me , I would be active .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . because so my Father had moved me .
on the military base I had to destroy the papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university connections , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , Pro@@ pag@@ and@@ amat@@ eurs , books , just everything .

&apos;@@ there the prisoners are fil@@ tered
my Father took me a total four times after La Perla - all in 1976 .
during the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time he took me to . he led me to a bar@@ ac@@ ke , in the cars , furnishings , TV , refriger@@ ators - just everything possible - were standing .
everything of it was st@@ olen .
he gave me a small in a blank@@ et wr@@ apped and moist@@ ur@@ am to wear it for the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the barr@@ ac@@ ke where the st@@ olen objects were completed and talked to a wax .
suddenly he prayed on an open space and said :
and there the prisoners are fil@@ tered .
I don@@ ated and saw a go@@ at on the human being .
it looked like a field @-@ bed and metal @-@ springs .
later I found out that they are attached to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was cap@@ tiv@@ ated there .
you rarely play a person with wr@@ inkl@@ ers to the bed , over@@ cast him with water and pursued him a car@@ go from 220 vol@@ t to the gen@@ itals .

the bases there was dr@@ ill there ... like a dirty win@@ ch .
years later , when my father was under Haus@@ ar@@ rest , the same sm@@ ell came out of his room .
I realized the sm@@ ell back immediately and I was clear that the sm@@ ell of a body in need is .
I could never forget this sm@@ ell .
and I asked me , How is it possible that a man can do so much suffering ?
&apos;@@ I knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my Father took me for the third time to work , he led me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were cap@@ tiv@@ ated with man@@ holes and we@@ al@@ tru@@ ction .
he talked to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilians , which was also in the process ) and I used the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked men with the face down@@ wards - they were cap@@ tiv@@ ated at hands and feet .
near the entrance there are silent on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father was not@@ te that I saw to the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what do you see ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I ent@@ ated &quot; why did you go ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were sent to a pit and was killed by soldiers and buried .
I know that because my Father is at home of it .
in addition to La cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as a office .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero there was a man mer@@ ged and put them .
( according to information from survi@@ ving the civil war , Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , which was also indic@@ ted at La Perla @-@ Ri@@ bera &apos;s trial , the students of Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina ( death ) .

the way , where you came here , is also the way , where the kid@@ n@@ atives came here .
if you look on the map , see that it took about this path and then were fil@@ tered for the first time .
here their names were changed and they came as part of the process of dism@@ iss@@ ing a number assigned .
if they lived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra , until the order of the above came up that they should be laid .
this was a lie - Euph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of the people and the dis@@ appearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; war w@@ ute &apos;
my Father brought all kinds of st@@ olen things to home .
back at the age of age , I had no idea of what the &quot; war &quot; war &quot; - as they heard it - was .
but when I was later on the military , - I was in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - I was clear that war w@@ ute a bay@@ onet or perhaps military sign , which one has fought one enemy that you have fought .

but if one go into a house and the fridge , the turn@@ tables , clothes , paintings , paintings , money ... sti@@ missing , then this is not the war@@ fare but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always asked me how my father , the leader of the security forces in this V@@ and@@ alism could be involved . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I understand it simply not .
I was also offic@@ er at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a home into a home and to ste@@ al everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
once called me he called a cri@@ min@@ als and I answered , and you who have cars on the street stu@@ ds ?
you are not cri@@ min@@ als ?
he explo@@ ded , he sm@@ ote me and sh@@ out@@ ed :
if you go so far , I will find you and bring you strange .
we do not need any other !
that was my father .
I have no only good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo from that at that I carried out a jack@@ et and a wheelchair pul@@ ley from Wol@@ le . both had my father from La Perla .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes with home .
back then blame me the defense , a co @-@ disappeared in this crime was to be . I have ref@@ uted no problem , they can lay down to me what they wanted .
I was anyway there to send out .
&apos;@@ das mer@@ ged the body is the last ab@@ ide act &apos;
now , where I am older , I feel rep@@ ent@@ ance .
I have children . if you only have children , you can recognize the value of a life .
one develops further and realize that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you have spoken out during the dictatorship of the dictatorship . but why do the cor@@ p@@ ses go out ?
why children do not lead ?
one day my father brought a girl with his home , his mother was killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl .
I asked me again the question : they were fil@@ tered , but why were they killed ?
they would have had to bring them into prison .
I guess it was simply chosen to kill these people . but why do their cor@@ p@@ ses go out ?
had these people not also families where you could pass their imm@@ ort@@ ality remains ?
the pen@@ dic@@ ed the body is the last ab@@ ide act that one can do to a man .
my Father told me when democracy was introduced again , she brought her machines to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners .
they were destroyed and somewhere - no idea , where . &quot; one will never find something , &quot; said my father .
but anything of course remains always .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how you killed people ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just have said the truth about 20 crime - including my father .
the thought to view my father , was born during a conversation , when he stood at home .
I made him sp@@ ake because of all of the atro@@ cities which I had to experience .
then he suddenly said , &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have not killed anyone . &quot;
I felt sad@@ dened me , and asked me , to the whole over@@ crowded patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; western and Christian feelings &quot; that they supp@@ os@@ edly were well def@@ ended .
then prescribed me :
how can you say sow@@ ing ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have a hor@@ ri@@ ble crime and you have forced me as a child to play with it .
he &quot; &quot; &quot; he ref@@ used only &quot; Na then . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
exactly that did I did .

I had finally recognized that he was a criminal .
nobody can throw me that I was taken . I eventually ended up against my own father .

a translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; fur@@ th@@ able driving . &quot;
the sign with the translation faul@@ ts at a center in Kyoto , where you can extend its leadership .
the photo was circul@@ ated in social media .
elabor@@ ation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in Japanese City Kyoto customers have been a newly opened center in which one can extend its leadership , last month witnesses a very special un@@ ambig@@ uous translation .
on a shield the Japanese word has been met ( kor@@ ean sha ) , the &quot; older auto@@ ch@@ drivers &quot; means , &quot; mist@@ ak@@ enly - maybe even with b@@ ös@@ able back@@ ground@@ ed &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; fur@@ th@@ ink@@ able drivers . &quot;
the wrong translation was on electronic display in the input area and to read the building itself .
editing the original f@@ otos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was often shared in the social media .
the error was the translator Hol@@ mes , a local residents of Ky@@ otos that dropped . it was also that the locom@@ oti@@ ves made it attentive .
the Daily newspaper Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come up with such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city such as Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; said Hol@@ mes .
the faul@@ ty English translation was first removed . the name &quot; H@@ drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; fur@@ n@@ able drivers &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate , if also gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct name &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older motor@@ cyclists &quot; ) .
the police of the pre@@ f@@ ecture Kyoto ap@@ ologies for the translation errors . furthermore , they explained that the error was already contained in the text that they had been checked by the translator and that the translation has not been checked for their correctness before it was published .
a blog@@ ger reported as follows on the sorry :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sorry that older people through the in@@ adequate correction ( the translation ) in our turn , &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News sat a little more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; old drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fur@@ n@@ erst@@ on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was indic@@ ted as an adequate description of the motor@@ cyclists . according to the police there are the share older drivers who are nation@@ ally involved in accidents , but quite an occasion to worry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the pre@@ f@@ ecture Kyoto for example were caused by a total of 19.@@ 460 in@@ cases of Sen@@ iors . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , caused by sen@@ iors 1.8@@ 03 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
in this way , its share rose to 17,@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents involving a total amount is decl@@ ined , the proportion of sen@@ iors are caused in the same period .
the name not named Rep@@ or@@ ter brought in the published version of the article comments to light , which show which pre@@ judi@@ ces some Japanese se@@ ated apparently against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo on the translation errors , among other things , the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fur@@ n@@ able drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) is not the reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
- &quot; so faul@@ ty , the translation is actually not at all , or ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t find that this is a real translation faul@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few kind of comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread in all Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and Asia .
the Web site En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real foundation for this bi@@ zar@@ re error in English .
photo by Flick@@ r @-@ user Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are mani@@ fold .
to translation you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the starting text and active language skills to transfer it into the target language .
the latter requires an active master@@ y of the target language - something that is in the case with mother tongue . in general the conviction that transl@@ ators is not in the target language - not in the initial consultation - mother@@ language should be .
this should be a French mother tongue , for example from English to the French language - not from the French .
photo by Flick@@ r @-@ users Karl Bar@@ on .
many Japanese businesses do not employ people with English as mother@@ language , translation into English . this may be attri@@ buted to faul@@ ty understanding of the translation , cost reasons or the relatively low number of English speakers , who will learn the jap@@ anese .
some companies who have even no foreign employees release , however , the Japanese employee does not make their English knowledge as the best added to transl@@ ators - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .
photo by Flick@@ r @-@ users Karl Bar@@ on .
machine translation are also widespread - often with funny results .
the wor@@ r@@ ens and mysterious sets that arise by machine translation , that this technique may not replace long human transl@@ ators . this applies to some languages very special .
some of the rare English formulations in Japan , including those of the sel@@ ections , which are often T @-@ shirts or po@@ ckets , are only used for stylish reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo by Flick@@ r @-@ user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable as jewelry nor acceptable or at least harm@@ less . but by major companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations .
the city Kyoto uses a rep@@ utable source for their translation .
Venezuela : protests and tents on the internet and television take care of
main page of the Port@@ als &quot; Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Frei@@ es Sur@@ fing ) of IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to PRE@@ NS@@ A y soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institut für Presse and Society ) .
on Fri@@ day@@ tomorrow , the 7th April , mel@@ ted ven@@ ez@@ an Internet user that they had no access to an online radio station vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later other users wrote that the internet presence of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV is also no longer available .
other online channels ex@@ tru@@ schi shots of the protests in Caracas , which were organized by op@@ position@@ ists groups that the Government of Nicolás Mad@@ uros .
the protests began in the beginning of April , after the captain , the Parliament dis@@ solved the Parliament and the tasks of the Parliament to the executive .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journ@@ alist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Tr@@ ac@@ er@@ out@@ es . he pointed out that the connection is dealt with , and recommended the U@@ bes , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship : activated your VPN .
it seems that web sites ven@@ ez@@ ol@@ an@@ ic providers are again locked .
this is from the side of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers like Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among dental ven@@ eers with internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been reported by the coverage of the protests of protests . at that time , the Commission will report about telecommunications and lock@@ ers when they continue to report on demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a call for violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I have signed me again @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
surprisingly , that it is more favourable than two lit@@ ers of li@@ on@@ ade to buy .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro confirmed later that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay by a blo@@ cking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) is in@@ accessible , but also two other online transmitter . this also concerns the website on which the National Assembly carries its sessions .
former rep@@ air@@ ings of the Institute of press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , we had to use the local internet service provider . this is a technique that will answer the DNS requests certain domains .
when a website is blocked by the DNS , the server will be incorrect or den@@ ied the request when calling such a website .
we confirm a DNS @-@ block : @ el@@ cap@@ it@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the transmission on Thursday , the 6th of April , adjusted , as the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flores , which was taken in prison live in Caracas .

in Paragu@@ ay you will receive a lot of girls to get a training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was as a child a Cri@@ adi@@ ta . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today Tina is fighting for the rights of children and coll@@ ects witness to other Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as , which were exactly as they were victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the short@@ ened version of a report of Kur@@ tural , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series called &quot; V@@ acas que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ elas que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; F@@ lying cows , refined schools &quot; ) , which is edited by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America and re @-@ released .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household , where they did not live together with the family who was allowed to eat there .
shortly before her studies at the university she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride over them . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
who has become something that has become something , &quot; said she .
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated in this house as a daughter .
when she became ten years old , she started to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as one described in Paragu@@ ay the more than 46,@@ 000 boys and girls , comp@@ elled to work to go to school .
the shop is quite simple : a large family with little money sur@@ rounds their min@@ der@@ old son or her m@@ old daughter to another , rich@@ est family . in exchange the child gets a job , a training and a roof over the head .
but what is not mentioned above , is that the children must make countless days of hom@@ es@@ work , which will never be paid and victims of abuse and mis@@ eries ; and all this within the frame of a contract cannot be stopped .
this as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go pra@@ xis is common in Paragu@@ ay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organizations .
after completion of her studies Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a couple of years for an organization that fighting for the rights of the boys and girls .
in doing so she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - sam@@ pled stuff and pr@@ ighten@@ ed .
you tried to name things in the name , because the feeling of gratitude that is the cri@@ adi@@ c as a spirit , guaranteed in general still silent .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is one on the one hand the family , who want their daughter in faith that they can improve their position in society and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something out of itself &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to another family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the family stands with faith and justi@@ fy its exploitation with faith that they would give someone a chance who would not receive any training , and perhaps even star@@ vation .
the victims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is sh@@ elled , his family will only experience many years later .
sometimes they have never experienced it .
in January 2016 , the relatively un@@ known phenomenon that has been relatively un@@ familiar phenomenon , which takes place in secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ic households , but a face .
as Carolina Mar@@ ín in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú came hospital , her body showed traces of severe b@@ lows . shortly afterwards she died .
it was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former Mil@@ ol@@ ean Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ejo , who works as Beam@@ tin in the inhabit@@ ant@@ lers .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ ería , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
at the end of January 2016 F@@ errei@@ ra as long as with a stick on Mar@@ ín ein , till they p@@ per@@ ish inj@@ uries .
this should be the last record in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported on the inci@@ dent .
she pra@@ ying that the mur@@ dered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UNI@@ CE@@ F or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela took deep into the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ic Society of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the crime .
they considered the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of sla@@ very . &quot;
several do@@ zen people came to prot@@ est@@ ant and demanded that there is &quot; no more Carolina &quot; in Paragu@@ ay .
the name of the girl and photos were widespread in social media .
&quot; in Paragu@@ ay are more cows than children , &quot; compl@@ ained Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without Pap@@ ers it is much easier to hurt the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the married and nearly 60 civili@@ zed organizations called for a better examination of the case .
they want to be that Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ejo for the murder of the girl who was sentenced to 30 years imprison@@ ment .
if the case occurs before the court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín will be rep@@ ent - if for the first time in history Paragu@@ ay be a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as are not only replaced as labor force , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ ners in which their father had to sign up , and lost their father to his work .
their brethren had to work all work and began to sell on the road or on the market swe@@ ets to earn money .
but they all went on to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
in the house of their employers Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
at the same time , they had to share the time so that you still have time to learn .
it was standing every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employers before .
free @-@ day for example , they puri@@ fied the fridge , p@@ ens the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the ground .
when the school was at the end , she went back home and had time to learn .
the more they had done with learning , the more leisure time it had .
but even this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says that she had never had hungry , but was also not limited food . &quot; I was allowed to pick more books from the library of the landl@@ ord as eating from the fridge . &quot;
the library was well equipped and belong@@ ed to the landl@@ ord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party who was with the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , which was owned by 1954 to 1989 .
in some paragrap@@ hs of the domestic Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , next to him and editorial from Op@@ posi@@ tional newspapers like &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo . &quot;
so he tried to persu@@ ade them to convince the reports of official media about the regime of dict@@ ator .
he kept them for intelligent , but did not inter@@ rupt with her . &quot; the host had someone found to heard , while he spoke about politics , &quot; says it .
&quot; they not allowed me to visit my family because they were the opinion that I would learn there again &quot; bad hab@@ it , which belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ í to speak at home their native language Guar@@ an@@ í .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your Lord fear@@ ed that they had the formation , which they had enabled to lose once again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it was entirely clear that she had given them for everything they had paid by them with her hard work .
also at school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a dis@@ discri@@ min@@ ated . &quot; one thing about which almost never spoken , are har@@ ass@@ ment and the ra@@ ils where Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as are exposed , when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they recognize it immediately that anyone who has no parents , a cri@@ adi@@ ta is .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to my home . I had no dog in school or in the neighbourhood .
in my youth , in time , where friend@@ ships arise , I think very clearly that I was not belong@@ ed to any group .
the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .

legislative design is writing to the Egyptian users of social media to register by government

&quot; &quot; &quot; six@@ ty Egyptian Parliament recently agreed a proposal to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regulations regarding the use of use and use of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he accepted the Parliament , user must register the internal and user of social media in Egypt with a governmental authority , in order to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the basis of the law would then be set up a spot that is scheduled to use its permission to use social media .
within six months with the acceptance of the law , user will need to register user on the website of the site with their correct names and personnel numbers , to use social networks .
will it be vers@@ ed to do so that this could bring a punishment of up to six months of cu@@ t or an exchange rate .
the legislative design consists of six parti@@ tions and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as a &quot; jed@@ we@@ al@@ application that is running over the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video files and text . &quot;
it is un@@ clear as the law is going through it , since the draft authorities are not yet thought of such as the Egyptian authorities , however , the Egyptian government currently does not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure the regulation on stage of social media company .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , parliament@@ sab@@ bath and Patr@@ ons , mat@@ tered the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a user name and a password to come through the fire@@ wall , the Facebook blocked . &quot;
that could mean that Egypt plans to be a fire@@ wall at national level around Facebook . due to those that would be necessary for the Egyptians and Egyptians to access information on their identity to access the network .
but it is not yet known that such plans do exist .
expert experts and experts on site are sc@@ ep@@ tical regarding the technical mach@@ ining of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; conduc@@ tors Technology &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( EI@@ PR , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I grew strongly in the technical capacity and understanding any authority in Egypt with regard to things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion they imagine that just as they are violent @-@ physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I take it seriously , then this means that they shall apply a strong surveillance system to protect citizens or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means a rev@@ itali@@ zed system to monitor the activities of people and also to introduce them to a court process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is technically realistic , but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must be discussed at the legisl@@ ature of Parliament and the constitutional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; committees &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before it comes to the plenary session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether his assu@@ mption and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft &quot; stands in accordance with a pro @-@ military thinking in parliament , in which sense the control is maxim@@ ally and assured that none of the dis@@ infection can be present on the desktop , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year the parliamentary sab@@ ah@@ er Tam@@ er El @-@ Sh@@ ah@@ aw@@ y a law@@ yer against cy@@ ber crime against Cy@@ ber crime was planned for those who were planned for guil@@ ty to threat@@ ening the &quot; public order &quot; and to prot@@ est . &quot;

one sub@@ type of the larger family of Leop@@ ards , belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat , and since they are still less pre@@ y .
why is this specific type of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
how R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; is the Persian Leopard the only survi@@ ving pre@@ y in the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem , and the health and the thought of ecos@@ ystems also depends on that a big room pet is available .
the chance to see a Persian Leop@@ ards in the free wild bo@@ ar is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video therefore poses that they have a recording of a great cat in the camera , breaks R@@ aza in re@@ iner joy .

in early March 2017 , documented the progress made for the north of Japan on the permanent daily Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o , the progress made in the last six years to be affected by the &quot; Tri@@ p@@ ly catastrophe , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a had triggered the catastrophe .
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung established its headquarters in Send@@ ai , which lies in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a certain pre@@ f@@ ecture of Japan in Japan , which both experience the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a and I@@ w@@ ate were cat@@ ac@@ u@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had disappear whole coastal cities .
even more , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , atomic accident , already alone had to leave their houses for 160 000 inhabitants .
the special report of the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o shows the progress of six years after that , in order to re@@ build the lives of the local .
the detailed report of the newspaper involves both statistics of the Japanese re@@ constructions and survey results of the affected themselves .
the housing facility in Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that until December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement parts ( I , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate finished .
the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures could draw Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , here , 80 percent of the planned replacement parts were finished .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses have finished Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a with 70 percent the final light .
however , one stri@@ ves to still , even six years after the catastrophe , ev@@ ac@@ uation of Beh@@ el@@ ed accommodation ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clo@@ ac@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in the final replacement parts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the three @-@ fold catastrophe almost 80 000 people were forced to live in fort@@ une accommodation .
in December 2016 there are still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a and I@@ w@@ ate in such things .
nearly 40 percent of the year 2011 ev@@ ac@@ u@@ it@@ ates from Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a live still in emergency accommodation , while Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are more successful . more than 75 percent of ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ac@@ u@@ ated , which were built after disaster in Beh@@ avi@@ ation accommodation , were converted into the final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate the number is here at 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected positions
as the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Newspaper could have been affected by 1100 schools , which were affected by the un@@ happiness until December 2016 , which makes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures are far more difficult .
while almost 100 percent of fishermen h@@ arb@@ ors in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now back into operation , have recorded at Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a 30 percent of fishermen and operation .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident , have moved into the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of the land of agricultural land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas , whereby only 66 percent of the A@@ cker@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed A@@ cker@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is unlikely , that is only a consequence of the nuclear weapon , because only 690 acres of 5 400 hectares of destroyed by Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , are located in the &quot; nu@@ kl@@ ear@@ thly zone &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has far back completely reco@@ vered again , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a far dropped .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back to 90 percent at the same level as before the un@@ happiness . Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a on the contrary , there can only be 75 percent .
however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the territ@@ orial inhabitants , it would be more difficult to earn their li@@ vel@@ i@@ hood .
is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
to determine a picture @-@ up , the paper conducted numerous surv@@ eys conducted by the local population and among the ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ed by the ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ed . she asked her about the state of the re@@ building and also how you can find their sens@@ ation in the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction to the article the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Newspaper :
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o led a survey by more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local people in experience .
the survey brought that 8@@ 3.1 percent of the local residents , measures have to be taken to be prepared for future earthquake and ts@@ un@@ amis .
however , 5@@ 5.9 percent of the surv@@ eys that has still not been done enough in disasters prevention .
as it is about those who had to ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated from pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ations
in its edition to the anniversary of the earthquake , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung has strengthened its attention to the situation of the ev@@ ac@@ u@@ it@@ ates from Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a .
Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a had to experience not just the enormous earthquake and the devast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a was also witness of the worst , dis@@ astro@@ phen@@ ols , atomic inj@@ uries that had to experience Japan ever .
from 160 000 ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ed from Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a were over@@ laid out almost 63 000 people in areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 there were some more than 23 000 people who have been back to Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , in permanent spare parts .
after the stand of 2017 still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the Kat@@ astro@@ phen@@ ols , most of the ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ants have to withdraw over 50 years of age , older than 50 years old . they have to compete with massive construction projects because the efforts for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a with massive construction projects are to compete with massive construction projects , which are part of the Olympic Games , which will take place in Tokyo .

his condition is as critical .
the local image journ@@ alist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which quickly spread within a few days quickly in Brazil .
on the pictures also the face of the police took to recognize that with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the inci@@ dent , the military police had known in the Brazilian federal state Go@@ i@@ ás that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o has been announced to the conclusion of the study of the inci@@ dent of the active service .

would a police have been tested by a prot@@ esters by the prot@@ esters and on the intensive care , his face would be six months long on TV and the entire op@@ pression would be justified .

the origin@@ ated from the det@@ in@@ ation@@ alization villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law by Á@@ l@@ var@@ o Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugars in whole Cuba the doors ( Photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the People community of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cub@@ an Province of May@@ ab@@ e@@ que , is commonly known as el Central - in Spanish sugar @-@ mill , regardless of that there is no n@@ able sugar @-@ made spot .
it is two years ago , when the activities in the sugars brands were laid .
after the refund stood the sugar @-@ tube industry in the region quiet@@ ly , and the factory moved to and after its plants , until only the sm@@ ells of steel and concrete remained .
about 272 workers had to be re@@ formed .
some is rarely the work .
other res@@ igned and comm@@ ons each day to the factories , which are still grinding .
N@@ ene , a soldi@@ er fl@@ yer , which represents every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar tube industry does not smoke its sleep .
he list@@ ened that there are in the east of the sugar cane brands that exist after long in@@ active time because they were received .
that was something that he did not expected .
N@@ ene remember that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al I would have received the sugar cane Factory , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar industry ref@@ used already the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market travel , the in@@ efficient , the poor administration and climate change .
2016 was the production 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than 1910 produced quantity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message would have been a moti@@ ve for a distur@@ bing to the country , but the poor harv@@ ests are already no new ones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
why was the Cub@@ an sugars industry ?
the old railway station of the community looked at better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of sugar @-@ tube industry was a economic necessity : the 155 sugars brands were technically simpli@@ fied , and hardly competitive they were un@@ supported for the country .
the initial idea was to focus production on the most efficient production , the annual production objective was 4 million tons .
they left only the factories , the sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.03 Euros ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the moti@@ ves that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar farms and the sugar rise on the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar rate increased from around a decade ago .
from 2017 to 2025 must remain the price of un@@ refined sugar between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per po@@ und , according to the 2016 report on the agricultural perspectives of the OECD and FA@@ O , the agricultural and food organisation of the United Nations .
if the current production of 2001 would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw material would manage around 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will come into history &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that were the first words of the Cub@@ an President Fi@@ del Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar lo@@ k in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from there , the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry .
in the following years the down@@ grade of a total of 98 sugars brands , more than 65 million people got their full sal@@ aries for advanced training .
the same happened in the sugar cane Factory Greg@@ orio Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez since 1967 in the factory .
if n@@ ene as he is known as a soldi@@ er , about the closing of the factory , is the word that he is the most repeated , &quot; fraud . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are the same opinion : not one of them has been informed that the factory would be silent .
that the place will be preserved , they formed a full time - working group .
in front of the first step year , the first letters began to come .
it was officially constitutional documents that would only be removed with respect to the parts that would be removed , the addres@@ see and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could use any de@@ duction approved .
from there the responsibility was transferred to and the letters always came more frequently .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was in charge for the still@@ ed factory and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the still running sugar @-@ gro@@ oves , no money in@@ sured .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for retirement in another facility , the Bor@@ is Luis Santa Colom@@ a .
he was against his will in the bre@@ wing of the factory , in whose construction he helped , particip@@ ates .
with any part that he removed , dis@@ assembled it one of his 31 working years .
the most developed industrial sector developed by Cuba and the most important workplace producer has been eliminated .
in many cases , no alternatives were caused to work and performances that generated the plants in the communities in which they found themselves .
we will never know if during the M@@ amm@@ ut @-@ speech of 21 October 2002 , the then president in the eyes of the present people saw , as he guaranteed that for the areas , whose factories have been no longer in operation for five years .
the price of the population for closing the sugar @-@ tube
since 2004 the sugar cane is only extrac@@ ted by grinding .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years the folk community of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ am that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
as the sugar pipe production , or better said than they started , they decre@@ ased they also on , the road to asp@@ hal@@ ing this dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy other factories .
you have been found to spare parts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without future perspectives , there were also many young people the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the area a grocery stores was created , whose production serves not even for the care of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant is still im@@ pos@@ ant .
at the end of 2016 N@@ ene at the factory Bor@@ is Luis Santa Colom@@ a , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
Ne@@ un@@ und@@ four@@ thy harvest bring the old soldiers a r@@ ente of two thousand p@@ eso a month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .

first Nations young people will take advantage of Hip @-@ Hop to express their own culture
recording of a song of &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .

youth of the First Nations communities in all Canada are dealing with themes which are important for them . they do this by Hip Hop , thanks to a number of trails .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ tour since 2014 work@@ flow by mobile Ton@@ studios directly to schools and youth centers , to accommodate youth groups son@@ g@@ writing , recording , audi@@ o- and video @-@ production and liv@@ ings .
the original workshops were led by the ped@@ ago@@ gues David H@@ od@@ ges , who lives in Montreal and in North @-@ Queb@@ ec with ten c@@ ree @-@ Communities and then worked with the C@@ ree Hip @-@ Hop Group The North@@ stars .
the workshop increases with that the young participants in discussions on issues such as &quot; cultural identity , language , examination , love , self @-@ being , or whatever it comes to mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos where young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of the W@@ inn@@ eb@@ ago in the U.S. federal state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o tells the story of the highway 16 , also called &quot; highway of the Highway 16 , also &quot; highway of the t@@ ears &quot; , in which almost two do@@ zen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or mur@@ dered .
the cases have been largely un@@ resolved .
the next video of the Nem@@ aska C@@ ree First Nation uses the moti@@ ve of a video style to convey , how important to preserve traditional customs and customs , despite the influence of globalisation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although young people were not always master the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ step i C@@ ree First nation have recorded the chor@@ us on c@@ ree .
the people involved in the young people received a little help from Gary Jol@@ ly from North@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop group , who give them a st@@ rop@@ he in dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay C@@ ree .
on the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ side of N &apos;@@ we Jing@@ an is available at the St@@ rop@@ he in the wording , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German .
sometimes I feel as would not ever be interested in myself
but I try to go on earth my days on earth
this is the day when you get our cry
because we have lost our way in life as a youth
but I believe that we will lift up one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a real life
how you can grow and end up with our youth
so you can do that of what the Creator has decided
in comm@@ ent@@ ance , the reader and dis@@ real of the c@@ ree @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also has a contribution and adds the St@@ rop@@ he in Sil@@ en@@ wording ( which is also published on his blog , and here with the permission is new released ) :

in Japan you can see nearly every restaurant of plastic dishes .
to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , are located near the entrance sho@@ ku@@ hin and pur@@ u ( &quot; sculp@@ tural models of the dishes &quot; ) from each cat@@ erer , which is served in this restaurant .
the customers see these plastic meals and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of this plastic .
in the Tokyo &apos;s district cho@@ os@@ ashi there are a variety of these small companies that produce those plastic @-@ plastic dishes , who produced the German film@@ makers W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago .
for most Japanese people these plastic boards are so common that they are not even more noticeable . a new trend is turning it today in the same mobile phone accessories and other gad@@ gets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blog@@ ger published the blog@@ ger , series of social media links and photos that makes this unusual Tw@@ ist with the sho@@ vel s@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new with plastic @-@ related mobile phones , as they are shown in Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu Kauf@@ haus .
many of these artificial foods were turned to kit@@ sch@@ y harv@@ esting , as in this case , cooler mag@@ net :
here are a couple of sho@@ als cooling mag@@ net for a new show at Tokyo Station .
the new boom in the essence of the Ess@@ lingen is becoming increasingly becoming more .
in this case a ka@@ ans @-@ don ( a popular travel length with seaf@@ ood ) will be turned into a cell phone .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we have found as a cell @-@ stand for a good use .
we also have made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo .
and here is an apple that create your mobile phone :
designed to watch like an apple , with a cand@@ le for mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that is only the beginning of an increasing approach .
some mobile @-@ stand and mobile designer allow you to restore your own art@@ works . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or Sal@@ vin@@ ely used , a popular T@@ opp@@ ers is served with white ri@@ ce .
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
are there someone who would say : &quot; Wow , cool , now I can le@@ ased my cell phone with laugh@@ ter ? &quot;
I think I will probably be the One .
this interest in plastic body can also accept a less appe@@ tiz@@ ing form to surprise for example colleagues or family members .
our latest cell @-@ stand has the shape of mel@@ ting ice .
in addition , there are also tourist balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , ear@@ rings and hand@@ y@@ ings made of dried sal@@ mon .
further scal@@ able plastic re@@ places can be found under : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter The h@@ ash@@ tag # .
if you like to learn more about the origin of this trends , then this video gives you an insight into the district cho@@ os@@ ashi which is dedicated to the Bel@@ i@@ ef@@ ching of the restaurant industry . like for example with the sho@@ ku@@ k@@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese Plas@@ tik@@ ety are actually manufactured .
a Mexican project tells the story of the survi@@ vor@@ s of struggle against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of struggle against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of in@@ - and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drugs , &quot; in Mexico the dist@@ res@@ ists and wo@@ und@@ ed regularly only in statistics . they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy , which brings this struggle with itself .
the coverage of the drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a @-@ Kart@@ ell , dr@@ ati@@ te the stories of the victims of conflict completely in the background .
on the day after a violent inci@@ dent you barely see on the mo@@ urn or to the municipalities that have learned to live with the pain .
thereby , behind any lad@@ der , behind any bone , behind any bone has h@@ ei@@ mer tom@@ bs , the stories paid parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose ham@@ lets might never heal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is why the Mexican news portal Anim@@ al Pol@@ í@@ tico , the digital project &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vivi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the drug trade live &quot; ) &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the drug trade will live &quot; ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to life that these victims should give a voice and stories about people who died in the fight between criminal prosec@@ ution authorities and cart@@ els . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anim@@ al Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project so :
organised crime can not only be afraid to fear our lives .
the effects are a lot of profound .
for example , if shops close because they are threatened by drug ad@@ ers and con@@ greg@@ ations therefore many kilometers to drive to buy something like milk .
the pain of the victims
a video with the title &quot; vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; as fear life &quot; ) tells exactly this stories .
a major fig@@ ur is Guadalupe , one Father , who ab@@ ound every weekend of the secret tom@@ bs after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Rodr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez who lost on just one day her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , their man and two of their ne@@ ph@@ ew .
priest : &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again on the task of which we have put forward to go back and to gra@@ ves , according to the people we loved , to look for . &quot;
Guadalupe : &quot; My son is called Antonio Ivan Contr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 , as he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in a m@@ ma in El Naranj@@ o .
on 13 October he left the house .
on October 15 he ought to be back again , but he never came again . Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need a training .
there is still my mother , which is also here with me .
at the moment she has no income .
you are the insurance of my father , but which does not get rid of it because they require a ster@@ eot@@ y@@ y .
where should we get that ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; Apr@@ ender a vi@@ vir con el nar@@ co , &quot; why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only have to show the faces in those who are fear of fear . we must show the international community to show the conflicts , the dis@@ bl@@ ind@@ ness and governance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high risk @-@ areas .
here are some excer@@ p@@ ts from the stories .
K@@ LA@@ HB , a reader of Anim@@ al Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the Federal State of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Park .
your contribution remin@@ ds us that you never consider violence as normal , no matter what form they occur :
I have now know illness and sens@@ ational journ@@ alism for several years now .
I come over every day to new@@ sletters over and see the titles with pictures which actually origin@@ ate from a text@@ book for cri@@ mination or from those from specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I have the feeling as if I am the lon@@ ely , which is attracted or sad . it works as a lack of respect for the person who once belong@@ ed to this body .
I cannot be effective or consider this as normal .
you writes on :
no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year C@@ ous@@ in thinks that he is pl@@ co ( German : drug ) will , if he is great . and it is also not normal that people listen to the &quot; Hel@@ dent@@ ate &quot; of off@@ ences if they go through the streets .
for me it is , as would they share the ones who have lost someone and those who have fear that they also have happened .
I see our weakness if stories are going to be mere numbers in a statisti@@ c .
the Tat@@ en@@ less@@ ness of humans is un@@ believ@@ able for me , if the death of six people and the f@@ win@@ ders were justified by 43 students in a neighbourhood that they were . &quot;
I think they are trying to talk so that they have spar@@ ed from such a trag@@ e@@ dies when they are not ru@@ sty and still are .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City , wrote the article &quot; Vier months Cre@@ ating in the main town . &quot; it describes it , such as armed crime month for month money from their business , until they had not only destroyed the business but also their family apart .
you think of everything you have lost and remember how many people can change your whole life in just a few days .
the ache he never goes , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes again high , if you are alone .
habits have changed , telephone numbers also .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the further we are removed from each other , the better .
it leaves their report to the words :
we want to be arrested by the others , as they do not know when they turn you or kill them .
I asked myself in these hor@@ seb@@ um@@ ble days , but the answers is no , because I have forgotten how to we@@ pt . I have to learn how to live with the pain .
the journ@@ alist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : one of violence drawn generation . &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions on how : who takes care of the child of a mixed wife and a man who was mur@@ dered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the endang@@ ering town of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them .
Bry@@ an is an or@@ ise and he tells him that he had to bring himself out how to make a egg , potatoes brilli@@ ant , tor@@ ti@@ llas warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi are living with him . this is his name for preparing the flo@@ o@@ chs with water , sugar and milk pul@@ le@@ ver .
he talks about the nine s@@ cars on his left foot - one for every year of life .
but they are ir@@ relevant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , told him that his mother disappeared .
but that was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood has been over two years ago , when he was just a few blocks away from his home , the blo@@ ody Body of his father saw , which was shot by armed men from an enlarged car .
as Bry@@ an was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez was seen as follows :
Bry@@ an was born in 2006 as violence through organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most vulnerable city in the world due to the number of mor@@ atorium on the border of public security and the government of the United States Government .
in 2010 alone the prosec@@ ut@@ or Office 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds in the cut 8.5 Mor@@ den per day .
these are just a few of hundreds of thousand stories that leaves organised crime in Mexico and inv@@ ading the soul of the country .
few stories always live with new head@@ lines . this project remin@@ ds us of those who we do not forget .
in addition to the project &quot; Apr@@ i a Vivi@@ en C@@ on El Nar@@ co , 2015 , Anim@@ al Pol@@ í@@ tico 2015 the data journ@@ alism project , whose aim is to present the complex information behind the failed struggle against drugs , which has drawn the country into the past four decades in the way .
when a picture is worth a thousand words
&quot; Shar@@ ing is Car@@ ing &quot; from the Flick@@ r @-@ User Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ strö@@ m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this article and the pages that he linked to which it is represented .
the fact check is important in a moment in which it comes to ins@@ ect a straight or for@@ gery a for@@ gery .
but how is the years after something the first time is born ? content in social media , no matter if true or un@@ true , t@@ ends to continue to exist .
taking this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DR@@ C ) .
since his first release , it has been used to be mis@@ leading , trag@@ e@@ dies that actually have taken place in Nigeria or My@@ an@@ mar .
this false p@@ airing of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First D@@ raft News - En@@ g@@ net not the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting about events in the DR Congo , My@@ an@@ mar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for images on .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
in 2010 performed a tank car the place S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ te around and explo@@ ded . thereby , 230 people came to life .
after the civil war in Africa , African village was negl@@ ected and thus des@@ ol@@ ated . the streets in the region have become dangerous paths full of impact , which were difficult to settle .
load capacities by the gas station to the victim .
authorities described a fire , the do@@ z@@ ens houses , including a cin@@ emas in the vicinity , which was full of people that illu@@ stration the so@@ cc@@ er world championship .
houses scattered and covered cor@@ p@@ ses in the streets scattered .
many people were burned .
a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ users Mys@@ tical Mon@@ key , 12 . January 2015 Maj@@ er photos of the inci@@ dent form the gr@@ ati@@ ful scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows rows res@@ hol@@ low body that w@@ ound up on the ground while they look at it .
but here the story is not the end .
over the years the same photo has been published several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , but not related to the trag@@ e@@ dies , in particular events in Nigeria and My@@ an@@ mar .
what happened in Nigeria and My@@ an@@ mar
on 3 January 2015 Cor@@ ed fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am the S@@ ept@@ ed nig@@ rop@@ es B@@ aga and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
eye witnesses reported dr@@ as@@ tically from atro@@ cities before they had to fl@@ ee .
houses and shops have been burned and cor@@ pse in streets and prayer .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2.000 people have been mass@@ ac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody remained behind to count , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one citizens to Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were tor@@ tured , shot or burned .
only from the satellite image could be represented the following time .
the occasion for the attack was also uns@@ ol@@ ved , but the ar@@ mies in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ es and the attempt of the B@@ oko Har@@ am , country to win ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture of the DR Congo are again on , when it was mist@@ aken as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented :
this is Nigeria .
a mass@@ ac@@ re of 2.000 people took place two days to Paris .
you are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this impro@@ per use of the image from the Democratic Republic of Congo are only one set in a number of fail@@ ures ; Africa Check has documented stat@@ ations to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the image was taken as a letter for mass@@ ages .
yet another step further bring personal comments such as this example is advisable to deliver the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to arguments .
the picture of S@@ ange also stood in connection with the de@@ adly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in My@@ an@@ mar .
according to a light@@ box , published by the UN , published by the United Nations , the fli@@ ee could fl@@ ee , rap@@ e and Etrus@@ can t@@ ote , some by ver@@ burn .
while others reported from violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Pos@@ ts as the following that these descriptions together with photos from the Democratic Republic of the Congo :
this picture comes from a Saudi Arabian Presidency , the President My@@ an@@ mars Th@@ an being said , mon@@ ks and politicians could have been involved in the murder of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , they had used the image of the DR Congo to communicate this information .
the origin@@ als of the original contribution , which was recently adopted on 26 April 2017 , can be called here .
other off@@ s organizations , the A@@ FP as its source , also had been mist@@ ak@@ ably Th@@ a Be this statement , but not so that the image from the DR Congo are related .
the worldwide range of false information
traces of this false p@@ ups can be returned to the years of 2011 and 2012 and are actually going back from all over the world .
using a &quot; re@@ vers@@ ed Image search &quot; one can give how far information exceed borders .
a re@@ vers@@ ed picture search with the search engine ink has found under 18,@@ 8 billion pictures ( stand from 3 May 2017 ) 344 pictures , which are very similar to the occupied image from the DR Congo .
they come from a mixing of private sites , platforms social media and collabor@@ ating as well as national publications and are in many different languages like English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have passed the wrong reports , we have tried to hide the matur@@ ity .
we have examples for the ab@@ usive use , and they have been associated with the respective countries on which side they were published . thus , we want to represent the reach more clearly than by the language alone .
from which trac@@ ted countries ( which were also associated with each other ) several examples can be used for mis@@ sible use .
here some cases that can now be completely revised ( on the map in Orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
country @-@ plays works by false p@@ unc@@ tions of the image from the Democratic Republic of Congo , with Nigeria or My@@ an@@ mar .
the or@@ ange@@ y countries indicate on pages or server , about the examples of matur@@ ity or fal@@ seh@@ ood are still available .
the countries in grey are examples that are also available according to met@@ adata and information that are available on ink , probably also matur@@ ity .
as remem@@ bran@@ ce , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what is happening in Burma - My@@ an@@ mar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo has been post@@ pon@@ ed in an online Disc@@ ussion Forum ( and interested , Arabs ) as part of a Th@@ reads to the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sten against Muslims . &quot;

even within Nigeria , the photo taken from the Democratic Republic of Congo as a proof of the bom@@ bing of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussions .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme example of an un@@ ambig@@ uous use of the image from the DR Congo , with one on the one with a Twe@@ aker , the sympathy , and on the attempt of an blog@@ gers , the rule of fail@@ ures that have been pursued as the photos of this impro@@ per have been used .
My@@ an@@ mar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Government of My@@ an@@ mar published a stra@@ ighten@@ ing report on what she as &quot; dism@@ iss@@ ful news and photos , held by international media , international human rights organizations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings with regard to My@@ an@@ mar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this direction is published only in English , also includes references to coun@@ terf@@ eit images of rum@@ ors , the H@@ ate Spe@@ ech , and by extrem@@ ist groups to set that Muslims kill the Buddh@@ ists and other sr@@ um ( which is often circul@@ ated by Bur@@ mes@@ an nation@@ alists ) .
Russia , 2012 . &quot; F@@ allen ри@@ ст@@ и@@ я и@@ с@@ и@@ я и@@ я в@@ ет@@ и з@@ на@@ я ? &quot; ( is@@ op@@ ho@@ bia or political pro@@ vocation ? ) .
this post , who judged to the members of the Russian @-@ Orthodox Church , clearly demonstrates that the image of the DR Congo is NOT Muslims shows the Christians .
Saudi @-@ Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this re@@ organisation of state was mist@@ ak@@ enly that the president of My@@ an@@ mar Th@@ an His 2012 have been cat@@ ac@@ ated that mon@@ ks and politicians who have been involved in the p@@ ans of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story to the picture of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the image is still included in it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article was published by 2014 about Stu@@ dents , published by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the An@@ e@@ oli@@ an near An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has expressly declar@@ es that the image is not origin@@ ated by the testi@@ moni@@ als , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar d@@ schi@@ ha@@ di@@ stic attack . &quot;
as the picture later in connection with the mass@@ ac@@ re of the B@@ oko Har@@ am , took place in circulation , tried the newspaper El Pa@@ is to opp@@ ose that there would be connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ sl@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ uy &quot; ( Nigeria , the world sleeps ) .
the picture of the DR Congo , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and solv@@ ent a discussion among Muslims after the mass@@ ac@@ re of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the connection to Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities were happening to this events , which took place in the name of Islam , a greater attention .
USA , 2015 .
the image was discussed as a letter for the mass@@ ac@@ re of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 tag@@ ged ( and more than 9.@@ 300 Male ret@@ we@@ et@@ et ) . but the messages that were linked to that were in no religious context .
instead it was the goal , attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media reporting in comparison between Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Maltese ) , 2014 .
after a message that was supp@@ os@@ edly prepared by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os , &quot; about the neg@@ ac@@ ic mass ac@@ re , translated into uph@@ e@@ et , translated it Disc@@ ussion expl@@ ores like this here on Vietnam@@ ese and explan@@ atory .
from the message , in which the picture of the DR@@ C was included , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ ine Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os .
there are other confirmed examples of an incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
on other accounts , ag@@ greg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( at the cap in grey ) shows ink also , but are no longer fully retro@@ sp@@ read@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , Peru , Peru , Netherlands , Sri Lanka , Azerbai@@ jan , Japan and possibly China .
( data in@@ spec@@ im@@ ens with URLs and time / data stamp exist on the web cra@@ w@@ ler and for@@ ging them through image file associated with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared only significantly after the original un@@ bi@@ ce of 2010 , the image will ultimately be a correct description , but the origin@@ als is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong themes or frames ( in@@ hibi@@ tions ) that this Pos@@ ts prevail . the first frame focused on religion .
the photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the murder of Christians by Muslims or - for the defence of Muslims and the murder of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Buddh@@ ists .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how a African life is evaluated compared to a European or French life .
religion do not want to understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worthwhile to examine how images are used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question is however what happens if readers can no longer believe these pictures .
with social media there are great people who have un@@ attended the un@@ attended part , the water around a tragedy .
sug@@ gr@@ ert these mood of the mis@@ ery and coun@@ terf@@ eit that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and nar@@ ro@@ asted it the actual Gre@@ ys of what actually happened in the DR Congo , in Nigeria and in My@@ an@@ mar ?
the dis@@ sem@@ ination of violent images was already discussed in detail ( here for example ) .
an argument is that the with@@ hold of images of a w@@ ading same , the tragedy can recognize that the tragedy are even demanded by the victims itself .
at the same time , the concern that non@@ violent paintings and audience is des@@ ensi@@ tise and to emp@@ ath@@ y the ability to emp@@ ath@@ y emp@@ ath@@ y ( such as this study , which have been subj@@ ection to how violent media seem to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss the s@@ lower intest@@ ines in the news media , is fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s message @-@ reporting .
Techn@@ ologist experim@@ ent , because with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News . &quot; you will have to be thorough about the situation in which a picture may be heard , which actually can be dis@@ solved by the context or dis@@ ab@@ usive manner .
a any investigation of false grants should be taken into account as internationally as internationally .

a blog with the name of Un@@ transl@@ atable ( e.g. D@@ t. un@@ translated ) stri@@ ves to make voice @-@ inspired a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not at all to translate .
such words are available in every language : they press certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these un@@ translated words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese war@@ d@@ ade ) and others who are deeply ro@@ oted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ m@@ esa ) .
but all resist@@ ors are in@@ sist@@ ent to each attempt of a simple translation .
one word or expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes some context are required to understand exactly what with this one word .
these unique words were collected already for a whole time in an online list .
most of these lists treat Japanese , French , French , Portuguese , or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ transl@@ atable &quot; St@@ even B@@ ird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog you will find an example of words from the VAT language of V@@ anu@@ at@@ u as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Bem@@ ü@@ h you have stri@@ ving for your parents in recognition of how to have taken care of you in your younger years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and words in the H@@ uns@@ wick language that are spoken in parts of Brazil as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or la@@ zin@@ ess , which one feels after one has begun on the old days in the sun .
in Bir@@ ds her own words from his blog About :
you wear other cultures , soft@@ ened other thought @-@ sounds and ar@@ ouse our re @-@ earth .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page , you want to post more of this &quot; un@@ transl@@ atable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
Red@@ ner der &quot; Treas@@ ure Lan@@ guages &quot; who are highly appreciated by Un@@ transl@@ atable are invited to upload their favourite here .

like Sri Lanka with the worst flo@@ wering of the decade
the island of Sri Lanka is currently looking at the worst high water level of land , disaster in this decade .
triggered by the moon , which usually starts at the end of May , are by strong rain falls the rivers of Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , Gin , N@@ il@@ wal@@ a and Att@@ an@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya reached in 15 district in the south and west of the country .
after an opinion of the cat@@ astrop@@ hies of Sri Lanka of 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and barely hundreds of people are ver@@ ted because of the flo@@ ods and keys .
over 400 000 people have been affected for over 400 000 people since the last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100 000 people have been brought to 304 safe ones .
the rain falls on Saturday ( 27 May ) after , and the waterfalls in some areas went slowly back .
health and hygien@@ ic requirements of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still un@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the flo@@ od disaster :
flo@@ ods in Ta@@ val@@ ama City with water board of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka twe@@ et provide regular updates to high power situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # Flo@@ od@@ SL to monitor the extent of disaster .

the car@@ car@@ afe has five air@@ planes for bail@@ outs and further five are made for the transport of emergen@@ cies for those in their overweight villages .
also various organizations and start @-@ ups have proved to be clear .
Facebook @-@ pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tim@@ s in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on high power situation and humanitarian assistance .

please call them today the number 0@@ 77@@ 74@@ 49@@ 729 or 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 84@@ 38@@ 41 , if animals in this area need help .
the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) b@@ itt@@ y people , their sit@@ ing data with the help of the app to share the cat@@ ast@@ oph@@ ical Centre .
last year after the catastrophe of the Tro@@ p@@ enst@@ ur@@ ms Ro@@ an@@ u , caused by a &quot; high water level &quot; button , which allows users to call it a vehicle to pick up with assistance and donations . these were then transmitted for free to the sr@@ il@@ ank@@ an R@@ ote cross .
likewise , she brought a &quot; SOS &quot; button to have more than thousands of requests and 150 successful boat actions for by flo@@ ur@@ water and dr@@ ashes .
the efforts by the government and the civilian population of Sri Lan@@ kas are fully realized in which several social media platforms are fully realized in need to bring people in need in need and do assistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has prev@@ ented the loss of other human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lan@@ kas are now coming up to the restoration of norm@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Muslims , which you cannot see
the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .

use of ig@@ t.@@ Dam@@ as in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighb@@ our and love girlfriend .
I trust her my four year old daughter , she familiar to me their children ; it is my wr@@ ath in the fire .
in the one minute we call for the rights of women .
in the next sk@@ andi@@ ose we rights for trans@@ sex .
we are located in a sea of rain@@ forests and people , some keep the i@@ kon@@ an image of a woman with head@@ towel high , bound from an American flag , other sk@@ andi@@ c counter against Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend look at me and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things concern not you , or ? &quot; why because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already led these entertainment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people , with whom I am working for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar that they know - from the far @-@ spread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they de@@ centr@@ ze me .
there are 1,7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves to be a Muslim but somehow we &apos;ll put all into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is very designed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , who as I do not fit them there .
Comp@@ ens@@ hip will be lim@@ ed
I ste@@ h not alone .
this is even the po@@ et that po@@ etry in America is most sel@@ ls : rum@@ i .
which pictures come to a sense if you think of it ?
love ?
peace ?
as a jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din was as old as I am now , he was a orthodo@@ x@@ er mus@@ cular and jel@@ ly .
Islam , the Quran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day , where he died , the center of his po@@ etry .
but in the western idea the religion was deleted , as well as from the most popular translations of his po@@ etry .
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the story of the 1,7 billion Muslims from this world .
another consists in the reduced pictures of Muslims , the Western books have been col@@ oni@@ zed for centuries .
this temp@@ ting image is determined by the dark man that you should fear and the exotic woman that you should save .
the land@@ ing Palestinian scienti@@ st Edward S@@ aid put into the history behind these pictures in the 19@@ 70s .
but this pictures also contribute to today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our politicians , the follow @-@ up industry and Hollywood are still ongoing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have worked for thir@@ teen years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful , lack@@ ed Nar@@ r@@ ative to domin@@ ate our News@@ fe@@ eds .
this Nar@@ r@@ v over@@ shad@@ owed the reality , which in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries while the US will not even choose their first female presidency .
this Nar@@ r@@ v fails to recognise that if French , mus@@ lim@@ ical women contribute to bear in public buildings and to cover Saudi Arabia to cover their entire body , which are both two sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercise his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong Nar@@ r@@ v we@@ aken mus@@ lim@@ ical women , the movements for change .
it seems that the first mus@@ lim@@ an prayers were spoken on American soil from Afri@@ cans who had been brought together with sla@@ ve .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this Nar@@ r@@ v made our collective imagination that is deeply deep and lack@@ ed , that is often Si@@ k@@ h men and children to the goal of tim@@ bered attacks and ra@@ ils .
because of these stories that we are telling and because of the way we can tell them is Islam@@ opho@@ bia today not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the other . &quot;
to the 1,7 billion euros
in the news industry we do more than just stories to tell which are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ ative , who help us understand the world .
and my industry is cre@@ ased to record the Nar@@ r@@ v of the 1,7 billion .
and we are here written , where seven million Muslims led to the highest degree &quot; diverse &quot; religious group in America .
more than one third of the whole Muslim people are African Americans .
six of ten American Muslims belong to the emig@@ rants of the first generation who come from 77 countries .
the parents of the author in 1976 in New York .
use approved .
four decades ago my rede@@ emed parents came to live in New York to live their American dream .
my mother put her first jewel design on 5th Avenue before and my father worked hard in the sk@@ ys@@ cr@@ apers of New York ; sk@@ ys@@ cr@@ apers were enabled by the mus@@ lim@@ an American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh by the name of conclusion to Rach@@ el K@@ han .
back then when K@@ han was newly discovered the Sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ avo@@ idable Muslims and Americans .
but now I am un@@ avo@@ idable Muslims and Americans ?
sometimes , if I ask people , why I am not a por@@ k esse , I say - instead of my mus@@ lim@@ bic recipes , to bring all Muslims , or my hand@@ bag who contribute to all Muslims ; &quot; from respect to Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I scher@@ ze , we do not carry all the pocket or@@ ane by us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also have to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be selected almost always for extra safety standards at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ar , mus@@ lim@@ ical activ@@ ists and inter@@ religious activ@@ ists , which will endeav@@ our to fight far more widespread lies on Islam .
these lies are produced on the ongoing volume of a well trained Islamic Islam@@ ists , Th@@ ink @-@ tanks and experts for fal@@ seh@@ ood , which is already faul@@ ty picture of what a Muslim is ; or of what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories that we are telling and because of the way we are telling them , is Islam@@ opho@@ bia in more than just a stran@@ ger , who knows the head of a woman .
or as the sc@@ ary map of attacks on mus@@ ques in the whole USA , see below .
scre@@ enshot of the AC@@ LU page .
Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its ug@@ ly forms we acc@@ esses our affili@@ ation .
it takes up our identity , which is as far as spacious and multip@@ ly that it can be impossible to fit into a drawer .

I want to explain that .
I was born as Muslim but a Muslim was born only in my imagination , when I was four years old , in a pro@@ visional mosque in the basement of an pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social ists describe religious life , they attack the following terms : faith , behaviour and affili@@ ation .
my mus@@ cular faith and behavior are not always visible , but they are there .
perhaps my girlfriend I see my neighb@@ our , my F@@ els in the Brand@@ ing that I am Muslims , when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our homes .
it would see the all@@ ot@@ al rit@@ ual with my daughter when I we@@ igh them in my arms , and ye bear the Arab verses for the protection , who defe@@ ated the Quran and to be called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them repeat three times .
I believe that it is protected from evil , evil , which you can see and evil that you cannot see .
my mus@@ cular faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my sh@@ aded .
the grand@@ mother of the author , when she wins an Ik@@ eb@@ ana competition in Kar@@ achi , with her sisters some@@ time in the 19@@ 60s .
use approved .
affili@@ ation is the image of my grand@@ mother mother@@ ly with her sisters ; as they win a competition for art of flowers in Kar@@ achi .
it is the picture of her that I see in this moment when I close my eyes : Nano , surrounded by their completed and un@@ finished paintings by many book@@ marks , a book with a hundred @-@ hundred four@@ teen chapters that can be almost co@@ stly .
Muslims also means to speak the prayers that they had said to me , if I have a bad day .
Muslims also exists when she brought me to God : Allah Mi@@ an , What God means , my only Lord .
for a people , that - about centuries - through a &quot; Empire &quot; col@@ oni@@ zed , which was founded a company with the name of hon@@ ored British Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Komp@@ anie , it has a deep meaning to give God my only Lord .
the author in 1987 with her grand@@ father .
use approved .
affili@@ ation means to grow and hear that men are not w@@ one , but at the same time to see that my inter@@ s@@ ander@@ ter grand@@ father cri@@ es .
Split@@ rin , while he writes books on modern Islam and about the independence K@@ asch@@ mir@@ s , cri@@ es N@@ ana Ja@@ an un@@ avo@@ ids around his family in by India , K@@ asch@@ mir , family that he was not able to close his arms in half a century .
affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , their families , such as with my grand@@ father , by col@@ oni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world like at the game risk .
Muslims also means to know that in the last two centuries Europeans are still col@@ oni@@ zed all to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means to know that the first F@@ lieg@@ erb@@ om@@ be the story in front of a century on a Muslim country .
it means to know that at the same time of grand@@ father of my grand@@ mother , an intimate , k@@ aff@@ mir@@ age of British imperi@@ al , from the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous , since he led the first mosque in England .
even before there were air@@ planes he travel@@ ed in more parts of the world than I ever was and pre@@ ached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

to my mus@@ lim@@ bic strain of the 1,7 billion people are deeply moved into our unforgettable st@@ am@@ mb@@ äume , our un@@ disturbed history .
it means to remember that four years ago the leg@@ acy military of the world , with troops that were distributed over every continent aside from the Ant@@ arc@@ tic , to pro@@ hibi@@ ts of mass destruction , which does not exist .
it means to know that more than half million Ira@@ q@@ be@@ ers are buried beneath the excav@@ ators of the war .
an American Muslim means to know that the self @-@ ord@@ rate of veter@@ an has risen since 2001 by more than 32 percent .
it means to know that if a tragedy the US is seeking and susp@@ ects a Muslim name , the story four times more reported than a story with a white attack .
it means to know that four years ago , the first prayer of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called by a fre@@ eing black sl@@ aves with the name Bil@@ al .
it means to know that two hundred years ago a African Islam@@ ist called Bil@@ ali Muhammad Sh@@ kl@@ av@@ t and brought into this land .
it means that Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero to call .
it is the warmth that I sp@@ ake as people are fulfilling the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand for our dreams and when we say black life .
a Americ@@ an@@ erin to be a p@@ act , a P@@ asch@@ a , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslims and a journ@@ alist means to fail the in@@ oug@@ her inter@@ c@@ ited identi@@ ties , but to fail to send them to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Nar@@ r@@ v of 1,7 billion creates more possibilities than a mag@@ ician , but it is represented in the reduced feature &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be a mother , to care about my child and all Muslim children , well @-@ knowing that power@@ fully and privileged people on this branch of structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in the Muslim str@@ aps which began with President Bush began and under President Obama was extended .
it consists in the continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists in the immigration , which takes a five years old child in hand @-@ waves .
it consists in a country which closes its borders with people from just the countries that it is bombar@@ ded .
it is a wrong and neb@@ ul@@ ous &quot; No @-@ Fly list , &quot; which takes largely Arabs and Muslims in the spot@@ light .
there are the wars that we lead and the bom@@ bs that we cast on Muslim countries .
because of the stories that we are telling and because of those who we do not tell , we are today here .
in a study with the title Asc@@ ent of Man , scientists of the North@@ western University participants will be a scienti@@ fically correct image and pir@@ ates them , groups on a scale of 1 to 100 with evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations that we have to lead
we are too deep dar@@ ing to commit the Muslim or the &quot; others &quot; .
we are decades back to recognize the roots of our fears and the faul@@ ty and dangerous expression , which we cover in our follow @-@ up actions .
at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , which tries to reconc@@ ile our many closely with binding identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast Lake Som@@ e@@ thing , S@@ ay Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ is ; the vir@@ al Vide@@ os@@ ery Secret Li@@ ves ; Schu@@ ster See &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative , ver@@ mor@@ ed mus@@ lim@@ ical authors to print and Ms Mar@@ vel , American Super@@ her@@ o@@ ine - all this makes me hope .

coll@@ age of the author .
but I am concerned due to this difficult global point in which we are .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1,7 billion .
there is a reason that pregnant theore@@ tic , which lead in the dark corners of the internet , now the White House will lead .
they are exp@@ on@@ ential because they have made Muslims and others . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that have grown exp@@ on@@ ential by taking the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years ago they had not been given them ; now master them master areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the re@@ alities and the story , which I was not aware of how I was as old now , but I made my daughter now , but which I made me an und@@ eni@@ ous Muslims .
things I have been here like a br@@ ot@@ ec@@ umen@@ ical in my speech .
things that might be remin@@ ders , for in all of the interventions , which makes our humanity like a story , where someone is made to another . &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , Con@@ vers@@ ations will take place at the 8th annual conference to Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; more than a hundred academ@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but these are no terms , with which we usually throw in our schools around us or we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why I count this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where but Edward S@@ aid , the man who has shown us how wars are led and people through the ser@@ ting of the &quot; other &quot; in the public presentation , four decades of scienti@@ st of Stan@@ ford was .
we have to ask ourselves un@@ convenient questions , according to the role of its , deliber@@ ately and un@@ aware of the &quot; other &quot; in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the employment that we have no president , which we had not bombar@@ ded into a new future , which has already been bombar@@ ded into a new future , which has already been bombar@@ ded over the visible countries and &apos; to other gem@@ stone , people goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1,7 billion .
it begins here with all of us .
initiative for demonstr@@ ating people wants to preserve urban diversity
history of histori@@ ans , by Flick@@ r @-@ users Daniele Ros@@ si , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be an option here , and now in spite of a language barrier with someone else ?
for St@@ even B@@ ird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) is the count of stories in their original language a possible response to it .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by St@@ even B@@ ird , the Un@@ translated blog .
however , the focus of T@@ LS is not written on the written form , but on the spoken words . it is an attempt to receive the language learning diversity of big cities and to appreciate .
actually , urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ akl@@ and in the United States , where T@@ LS has been carried out since 2015 events , the risk that small and not entirely so small languages will not be passed on to the dam@@ s children .
for the cre@@ ators of the project :
the mass@@ ac@@ orn of the languages of the world can be avoided if we accept cities , the Di@@ versity accept - safe spaces where inhabitants do not forget who they are to da@@ iry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen often to understand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the confidence to appreciate , to tie , to tie . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format a stor@@ yt@@ ellers present their story first in their own language and then translate them in English .
even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , so perform their dev@@ otion and their representation that the assignment shall be ad@@ minist@@ ered to it .
they call laugh@@ ter and emotions than be the language no longer a barrier .
the following video presents for example a traditional story of Burk@@ ina Fas@@ o who is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round the stor@@ yt@@ ellers in R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou con@@ ate also the opportunity to explain for their country typical customs of practi@@ tioner .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the f@@ abel from H@@ ats and the P@@ avian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zim@@ bab@@ we :
after having asked the importance of his F@@ abel , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked about to speak about an audience , which your language does not understand ? &quot; with a broad Gr@@ in@@ sen he shares his feeling of inclusi@@ veness :
you have related !
you were attentive ...
you were all with me !
so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling in three cities have taken place , and the organiz@@ ers hope to expand this . all who inspired by the project by T@@ LS in contact to organise their own history .
Puerto Rico calls for the United States re@@ unification of state debt
with the aim of a re@@ formation of the public debt of Puerto Rico , who participated in 72 million US dollars , participating in the pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ de Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and ran down to Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
called it by group@@ ing &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la D@@ eu@@ da &quot; ( civil front for the neur@@ ot@@ ations of debt ) and the Ö@@ kom@@ en@@ ic church meeting in Puerto Ric@@ os .
the prince of the re @-@ strength of the debt have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os calls for that politicians , B@@ än@@ ker and government agencies responsible for debt to be held responsible for their cor@@ rupt .
we call for a financial examination and a guidance committee without personal interests on public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions , which acts in favor of the economy .
we will be pressing and supp@@ res@@ sed .
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os ref@@ ert to pay a debt , which is not their .
we will not choose between education and health .
our p@@ ensi@@ on@@ ers will not be pos@@ ited with sin@@ king retirement .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not in the state of the territory of the USA - suffer from a serious financial crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the so called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Centre for New Economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , a government non @-@ profit organization with focus on soci@@ o @-@ economic development , a law on the state of responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis Puerto Ric@@ os requires a wide restructuring of state infrastructure .
from outside the outside measures , without the participation and conviction of the citizens are risk to be ref@@ used by the people .
the demonstration carried the name &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

the intro@@ duc@@ tory part of his book with the title Coll@@ ective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom .
to see , as Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us begin to think about their own destiny , deeds and decisions .
why are we today here ?
what have we decided ?
what have we posted in this process of tim@@ eless con@@ vic@@ tions ?
the Web Develop@@ er for open source and digital activity has been in the Haf@@ t Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
in October 2015 Bass@@ el from the Ad@@ ra prison , a non @-@ military institution was transferred to an unknown place .
his wife , the writer and Ombud@@ sp@@ erson in N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; military @-@ police took on the basis of a &quot; strictly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strictly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported she was cont@@ acted on 12 November 2015 by individuals who put themselves in himself as in@@ spec@@ ulation of the Assad and put them up by a su@@ al death against their husband .
be his position and condition remain unknown .
a pion@@ eer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a decisive role in it to expand access to the Internet and to knowledge of the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , Techn@@ ologist and currently over@@ coming the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project , the Bass@@ el founded on the pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ tion cultural protot@@ ypes is provided as the work that he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 in order to re@@ constructed the ancient ruins of Pal@@ m@@ yr@@ as .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the im@@ inary of numerous civi@@ liz@@ ations and here mer@@ ging Greek architecture types with hi@@ es@@ y traditions and Persian influences .
Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after having started working with this work , the IS would raise all this , that &apos;s not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens , but the world em@@ bo@@ died out .
this strip enters into the digital Archae@@ ology and the conservation has created a timer that will be in@@ valuable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
Trag@@ zeit could not yet res@@ h@@ ated this project until now .
N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my whole life with it , of freedom to dream and accordion , taught me to embrace them .
I am overwhel@@ med when I n@@ enne his name .
Bass@@ el brought me English to me even when he was located in Haf@@ t .
I learned English to read and speak English .
he has always shared his knowledge with each of which he asked . he has taught other In@@ cu@@ sto@@ dy , English to write and speak .
Bass@@ el has opened the gate to the technology . he taught me , both computer and smart@@ phones .
he brought me the internet .
he also has other incar@@ nation , as they use computer , at least theoretical , without that they actually stopped one in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( waiting ) , a Pro@@ sab@@ uch that she wrote in the years 2012 till 2015 her husband when he was located in Haf@@ t .
Bass@@ el and N@@ oura have worked together on the book .
she tast@@ ed the lyrics to him when they visited him and he translated them from the Arabian into English .
the book is licensed free .
book of Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nora with the title &quot; It is happening &quot; :
it happens during any visit ,
that I failed in the world of your charming eyes ,
that I perceive the Bes@@ kid@@ ney at the moment we embrace ourselves ,
that each of the dangers no matter is ,
each of the f@@ ences , f@@ ences and cal@@ ves
I ver@@ se the Ged@@ ser@@ tion of the pr@@ isons
and I dr@@ yers in every detail of your voice and words
which I am with passion for me ,
when your eyes say liver li@@ flower
and I see another piece of my soul with you ...
I swi@@ ft@@ ly back to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to re@@ produce all the moments ,
and to smile about your absence and smile .
I survived myself , that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the initiation of Bass@@ el wrote G@@ ha@@ zi :
a year goes , my soul
during the day
I in your c@@ age
and you are still in the c@@ age of the mon@@ ster
Bas@@ tion History is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the regime of Bas@@ har al @-@ Ass@@ ass@@ al are according to the &quot; Network for Human Rights ( Syrian network for human rights ) more than 65.@@ 000 people disappeared .
those who were arrested or under violence through the regime disappeared , were tor@@ tured or even executed .
until 2016 , since 2011 the international human rights organization Am@@ nest@@ y International at least 17.@@ 723 Sy@@ rer has died in Haf@@ t since 2011 .
the stories of many other people are unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
we repeat our demand in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Moz@@ ambi@@ que : because of corruption inter@@ acting director after harbour brief@@ ing back on the previous post
Mos@@ ambi@@ kan@@ er re@@ ag@@ ates with wr@@ ath on a cor@@ rupt stand , in which a regi@@ stering , after half of his sentence returned to the workplace in the state apparatus , at which the corruption was committed .
it is here : Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , in 2008 and was arrested along with four other def@@ endants of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( around 800 000 Euro ) for 22 years in prison .
the money st@@ ained from public funds from Mos@@ ambi@@ que , whose Council Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 board .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 because of a good guidance and immediately requested his re@@ peti@@ tions in the company , which took place on 19 April .
in accordance with an opinion of the prosec@@ ut@@ or Office of the Republic , the request was made , there would be no obstacles to Cam@@ ba@@ za , back to its old post , as the company is full of discipl@@ in@@ ar@@ ation after his harbor .
however , many people do not have the action well .
the Centre for Public integrity ( Centro de Int@@ eg@@ rid@@ ade P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , shortly C@@ IP ) , a local institution that advoc@@ ates for public transparency , condem@@ ned in an interview with the Deutsche Welle decision making the decision again :
represents a proposal in the fight against corruption and indicates the lack of transparency and is even a step forward with regard to the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP .
what we take note is that the company should also have a discipl@@ in@@ ary proceedings against the resistance .
however , the firm allow apparently to illu@@ strate a reasonable legal steps to apply the appropriate functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio VA@@ Z , a significant voice in the mos@@ ambi@@ valent social media , re@@ jects this behavior also and considers the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conf@@ lic@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ ba@@ za a competent type would be , he would be consultant when he was sentenced to a imprison@@ ment and the half had dinner .
he could hold numerous lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and put his image gl@@ oss .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has maintained to be integrated into the company that he has helped to add damage .
consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za will be happy to be paid for his silence .
resist@@ ably !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ ambi@@ can@@ arian and student of Political Science in Brazil says , the director of David had no Mor@@ al :
Cam@@ ba@@ za from the state recogni@@ zes , because he won him w@@ ound I cannot believe any@@ body in such a way that the state has already received so massive .
Cam@@ ba@@ za is missing the mor@@ als to return and serve the state , * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead it serves only by the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as a hand@@ sh@@ al money source and the state itself is tired too , the pre@@ loaded and finally condem@@ ned to a long imprison@@ ment .
frank@@ ly , I do not know why this man was rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te preferred to remind the Prime Minister of Mos@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remember that a th@@ ief belongs to the prison :
Di@@ ters belong to prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el will not only remember the Mos@@ ambi@@ tion and not only as a first independent president , but also as a sharp , im@@ pe@@ er and - next door is said - proph@@ etic editors .
one of his most famous oral actors was , when he discovered that &apos; a ambitious person is capable of everything , also the fa@@ ther@@ land for its ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest to sell . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if a ambi@@ valent man changes , my experience shows that that is not so . he does not alter the tac@@ tics but he does not turn out of his ambi@@ tions .
a ambitious human being is at the same time cri@@ min@@ t . &quot;
in Twitter the responses were also abl@@ ish@@ able :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat 10 years from and arrived free .
and today it sets him the firm , at which he died , again under the contract . # As@@ sim@@ Vai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Sett@@ entri@@ Show &#91; @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12 May 2017

Facebook blocked the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in My@@ an@@ mar and c@@ ens@@ ored many users to dis@@ right
the bur@@ mes@@ an word &quot; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &quot; means ki@@ pe@@ el or sp@@ amm@@ b@@ se .
photo of San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Commons , Creative Commons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ e
according to information from Facebook users in My@@ an@@ mar , the famous Social Network took their em@@ ts from the net because they liked the word &apos; kal@@ ani &apos; .
though about the origin of the word still is deb@@ ated , it is usually used to refer to people as indic@@ ative origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective .
Facebook c@@ ens@@ ert the word &quot; cal@@ ar &quot; or sti@@ ckers &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ical font ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of the Assy@@ ria in Burma in the social network .
in recent years the rise of radi@@ al nation@@ alist movements gave the word an extremely valuable conn@@ ot@@ ation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by Ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as a speech against Muslims , a minority of the population in My@@ an@@ mar .
but in an effort to fight a speech in My@@ an@@ mar , the company has c@@ ens@@ ored a lot of sen@@ sel@@ ess content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word itself is not calling in isolation .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that even Pos@@ ts in which they discussed the use of the word or have doubts about the purpose of his hand , c@@ ens@@ ored .
moreover there are several bur@@ mes@@ an words with the different mean@@ ings that have the same letter as &apos; kal@@ ani &apos; .
for example , chair on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; kal@@ ani ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; written what the same letter contains , as well as other words such as &apos; kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &apos; ( A@@ hr@@ b@@ se ) , &apos; kal@@ ani o@@ at &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; cal@@ m@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ us@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at stated the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &quot; kal@@ ani &apos; :
a post of one of my friends has been deleted today because he was contained the word of kal@@ ani .
however he asked his friends on a spiritual nature , whether they might sp@@ ake as he could sp@@ ake his back pain , as he made a text game .
the sentence ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the Be@@ age@@ word ( la ) to Bur@@ m@@ ese - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were several reactions to the initiative from Facebook .
zin Win H@@ am is the opinion that she is to reduce h@@ ass@@ ing nation@@ alists , but also , that fac@@ ial may be analy@@ tic , before it proceeds all Pos@@ ts to spread rac@@ ism in susp@@ ected rac@@ ism .
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it is fil@@ tered the word automatically .
the automatic dis@@ m is not understood what you write on fac@@ ebook .
what it should be instead , the post is carefully to analyze and control it by using the adjacent words .
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &quot; ( Mu@@ er@@ b@@ sen ) .
the good is that this dre@@ am@@ y nation@@ alists , dis@@ semin@@ ate a pretty good lesson .
now it is time to circum@@ c@@ ision their nation@@ alism .
while the action likes to send a strong signal to all the h@@ ass@@ ing language may not keep the efficiency of this strategy for long time .
the experience of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ chat have proven that the cen@@ sus of stroke often is a cat@@ chy and mouse game , whereby the users can start social networks simply to use a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the c@@ ens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author of Ka@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described , as Facebook , began to delete his post , when he wanted his friends to inform his friends , that the word &apos; cal@@ ar &apos; is con@@ b@@ anned from the social network :
... when I was attentive to this new Directive on Facebook , I made a post to share my Facebook @-@ friends that the word is locked .
ir@@ on@@ is@@ ses was removed my mail from Facebook and told me the lips , post and sharing of content for 24 hours because the post office is not correspon@@ ded . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of tromb@@ one of people who have no negative intentions or simply try to show their opinions against the H@@ ass@@ talking radic@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with speech :
post without H@@ ass@@ ino from Facebook away .
in the post @-@ part of the author his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have been done before the beginning of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ mes@@ an Internet community to ask for advice :
Facebook likes a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma by its platform but it does not work .
such words must be ens@@ ored only even more hat@@ red within the different communities .
in addition , it appears as if she started without local context or technical support , and so words like &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; buil@@ sen@@ curr@@ y &quot; have been b@@ anned .
even when they found out that they did not have any mistakes , they don &apos;t want to re@@ inv@@ ig@@ ate the pre@@ cip@@ itation of it .
if they had only have more respect for the 15 million benefits that will take them a great turnover , it would be great .
Fac@@ eb@@ ooks automatic c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship has taken care of a lot of sp@@ ott among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users are now aware of Facebook funny and be aware of the word &apos; kal@@ ani &apos; not in the context of H@@ ass@@ languages to see whether their em@@ ts are taken from the net .
here you can see some scre@@ enshots of Facebook @-@ Pos@@ ts that were no h@@ ass@@ ing language , but nevertheless they were removed :
used with permission .
the bur@@ mes@@ an &apos;s text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and at the P@@ ale curr@@ y and watch an Indian movie .
only to try whether Facebook removed the post , which contains the word kal@@ ani . &quot;
scre@@ enshot , with permission used .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are a doctor , heal you then people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scre@@ enshot , with permission used .
over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to bro@@ aden their voices and their influence .
among other things , H@@ ass@@ ination in social networks enter the violence in the churches in My@@ an@@ mar in addition to ser@@ ene , especially in the Rak@@ em@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Buddh@@ ists have forced to escape .
Facebook has been for his failure to bring about ch@@ ari@@ ous h@@ ass@@ ists on his bur@@ mes@@ an pages under control , cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed .
however , instead of simply the word &apos; cal@@ ar &apos; to c@@ ens@@ ored , it would have better running , rather on context as on the code most concentrated initiatives , and learned from them .
in Tr@@ ini@@ dad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is an end with the child .
a wedding ring in the sand .

the child @-@ toe is now illegal in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament adopted in the country un@@ anim@@ ously decided that this practice has to offer , so that the hei@@ r@@ ative age is now at 18 .
in front of this change of the wife , some members hin@@ du@@ ous Religi@@ ous Religi@@ ous institutions at the practice , and in May 2016 there came to a large public out@@ cry . back then brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aja , a group that representatives of the various religious groups of the country gathered , since the state is not inter@@ mix , since that , age not the matur@@ ity . &quot;
this happened , regardless of the fact that Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the UN @-@ law firm , the reduc@@ er than , every person under the age of 18 years . &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were married with 15 already married , in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago 2.8 percent , and with 18 were 8,@@ 1 per cent .
in 2011 the statistical Central Office of the country was confirmed that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys below 19 were married .
online petition and social @-@ media movements that stri@@ ves to disp@@ ose laws to the child @-@ toe , followed up on the foot and advent@@ uro@@ us great support . undoubtedly it will bring them to bring this outcome .
nonetheless , it did not work anything trouble .
a H@@ ind@@ u guide , e.g. had no concerns , the critics of the children &apos;s wo@@ e , they should take care of their own affairs . &quot;
this kind religious opposition hold tensions in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and at some point a doubt whether the opposition would have to agree with the legislative design at all .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the law@@ less@@ ness was decided against the child @-@ wo@@ e - despite 4 Sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who could think that he could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives where already an easy majority would make him to the law .
now only the President of the country must agree to the law and pro@@ claim the law .
one of the sen@@ ators of the country gave on Facebook an Status @-@ Update , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle at inst@@ agram has again found :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the legisl@@ ated against the child @-@ wo@@ e was adopted in Repres@@ ent@@ atives in Repres@@ ent@@ atives of 35 votes for this and none of the other against it .
after having decided previously made in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of the social media User @-@ User was enthusiastic because the laws of the child were finally been changed .
Facebook @-@ member Lov@@ ell Francis , who ass@@ ed a minister in the sculp@@ ting crit@@ erion , said :
it has too much time and un@@ necessary sm@@ ede , which has w@@ asted the core of the matter but know it what ? the child @-@ wo@@ e is now illegal in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago , and this is almost every cost .
while A@@ bel Jackson of opinion was , it was definitely long enough to complete the practice , Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas over@@ happy that the day was finally come :
public status update on Facebook of Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which is said , , Her@@ bi@@ rag@@ ing News !
the spouse has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , who belong to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society group , which were quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was , not@@ te :
the holy age in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious conf@@ essions 18 years .
the draft to change the spouse was adopted today , on 9 June 2017 .
in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives there are 41 members and they were 35 in the vote .
all MEPs who were ad@@ minist@@ ered for the law .
the child @-@ toe is not allowed in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago by law .
it was a long term ( ... ) # and mar@@ ri@@ ag@@ ei@@ tor@@ tie .
many thanks to all activ@@ ists who have made him out .
congratulations .
a thanks to our MEPs .
but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aja therefore , the Secretary General of San@@ at@@ an D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous H@@ ind@@ u organization of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ago the Mahar@@ aja has pro@@ claimed his intention to take gr@@ aded steps , the law should be adopted , and he seems to have his promise now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the govern@@ ors of Paris Al R@@ aw@@ i , a constitu@@ ent of the law , said , it is quite right , if Mahar@@ aja against the law , the most Social @-@ Media users , one would commit the debate on the subject differently .
Patricia Wor@@ rell sm@@ ote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather , if we , instead of speaking the discussion so general , in a way that the state would be able to talk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to talk the state in our bedrooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the state shall protect them that it may be of great , hard @-@ min@@ ded men who are against them compared to the benefit , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; would you be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
or do you think that it is not a problem ?
however , whether there is an important action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the children &apos;s labour is legal or remains the norm although there are laws they say .

since over a month Turkey has now sp@@ otted the popular and the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pe@@ dia .
day for day will be more evident as important the platform for users is to find helpful and share reliable information .
both students as well as Rep@@ or@@ ter and fans of TV series to block the block@@ age .
although many engine@@ er @-@ vers@@ ed internet use it used to use envel@@ op tools for block websites ( an up @-@ to @-@ date articles from the New York Times on that Turkey has the third @-@ biggest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence of the world ) , the most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has recently opened article from Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Har@@ v@@ ard University has been adopted , regular block@@ ages of the internet since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) .
after China , Turkey is the only known country in the world when it comes to the massive c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia .
while the platform continues to be blocked , are now several Mir@@ ror@@ pages ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) .
a solution managed by IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform all Turkish Wikipedia @-@ pages on its de@@ centr@@ alised Peer @-@ to @-@ Peer @-@ network ( i.e. computer machine connections ) , which does not base itself on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
the content is despite legislative ban but dis@@ able .
in a Blog@@ post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after we have heard the news ( about the blo@@ cking of Wikipedia ) , we put everything in mind , sn@@ ap@@ shots from Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the ability to read the content on de@@ centralized and dis@@ shared ways .
this can help users to see at least all Wikipedia content , even if they can not reach the website www.@@ wi@@ kipe@@ dia.@@ org itself .
IP@@ FS was also done that this step was done independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is just about scre@@ enshots and not any dynamic or dynamic versions of the website .

to promote the protection of wild animals , placed Sag@@ ar the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I cli@@ cked for environmental protection ) in his photos .
however his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als nature and wild@@ life is not always easy .

this article was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ s@@ a and was published originally on the Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organization from India .
a updated version was published here as part of a content sharing Convention .
in many parts of India , women prev@@ ented with the greatest care , the names of their wives or even of older men in the family .
instead they use a Pr@@ onom@@ en or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pr@@ ad@@ esh give women to respect the husband &apos;s social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences they should receive the standard ab@@ used , this practice on life .
last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condem@@ ned by the Indian state O@@ dish@@ a by a bow@@ el and passed away by her family and the village of the community after they had raised a asp@@ ed relative with names .
the tradition has also not called their wives , also under the name , is also common under males . however , they have far less legitim@@ acy to fear , if all , they should not come into practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , occurred nine women , including health care staff as well as hou@@ se@@ wives , a unique cl@@ ub and became quick to the main topic of the city .
it is a place for them alone where they can discuss and discuss the int@@ ric@@ acies of Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 cl@@ ubs , which is in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers and advoc@@ ates the reduction of Patri@@ arch@@ ate Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Ro@@ hin@@ i Pa@@ was working for seven years with the help of their vide@@ ok@@ am@@ era on the un@@ covering of practices , such as Kinder@@ hei@@ rat up to the union of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and guides these clubs .
they reported on how this club made a safe place for these women and made them simultaneously to mess@@ engers in the wall .
the first video , the Ro@@ hin@@ i was shown in their Disc@@ ussion rounds , hand@@ made of women who don &apos;t name their wives .
she chose this issue because they wanted to open the conversation about Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women can easily identify .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the name of her husband is not noisy as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a bree@@ ze which they must maintain all the age of debt and never ques@@ tioned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ro@@ hin@@ i said :
this tradition testi@@ fied that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not hold , is regarded as de@@ pos@@ ited as a woman without mor@@ ality .
the tradition is so deeply ro@@ oted that we have never made ourselves thought of this discussion .
at the beginning he wanted to go Ro@@ hin@@ i , who had never called his spouse so far at home , at home , as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussions with her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Ro@@ hin@@ i tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband flo@@ ating long after the video was at the end .
Pr@@ ac@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I sol@@ ow@@ sing him from now on his name .
with this self @-@ confidence in baggage , Ro@@ hin@@ i started his first Disc@@ ussion club .
many women had heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; has never heard before . some believed that it would be a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women protected .
at the beginning of the round Ro@@ hin@@ i showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pr@@ ad@@ esh .
after the vide@@ o@@ projection the women , the discussion with a exercise in motion .
Ro@@ hin@@ i asked each participant in the name of her husband with different po@@ ems - happy , angr@@ y , lov@@ ingly , lov@@ ingly , and so on .
then she asked all , &quot; If we cannot say the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want , means that they do not respect ?
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of these women have been married since 30 years and this was the first day , where she brought the name of her husband to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra in the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about the break of a long @-@ long tradition , in the married women to speak the name of their wives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ro@@ hin@@ i tells :
a woman was so sh@@ y that she came up during the whole exercise , a different decided to sl@@ ed the whole fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sed him .
the expression on their faces was ek@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
even in the ad@@ ren@@ al in@@ gi@@ veness , having broken up with an ur@@ old bread , decided that they actually would try to call their wives to name their wives .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days Ro@@ hin@@ i received a variety of reports .
the Eh@@ man of a woman called Ro@@ hin@@ i and asked what ideas put them in the head : his wife could not stop doing his name .
a different folding link decided to do it at dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she sto@@ cked , she got fear and said that there was an error .
another woman said : &quot; Ro@@ hin@@ i said , I sol@@ ow@@ do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant in a group was less understand@@ able and the situation art@@ ed in violence .
ro@@ hin@@ i reports as women tried to stop other practices , such as the t@@ ages of the zinc red point on the foreh@@ ead , which shows the spouse :
why have only women show that they are married ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said to my husband I would bear the cin@@ der @-@ red point , if he would like it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he lau@@ g@@ hed only and I heard him to bear him .
the other women have not completely heard completely with it , but mean , they are now in a better position , even to choose him in some days not to bear .
for many women the Disc@@ ussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip with every discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
usually we pack lunch and water and go into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to make sure the women make sure what could hear , &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they dan@@ ces and spoke about things that they had never thought before .
Ro@@ hin@@ i says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have been short@@ ened over some things , for example , as our identi@@ ties to our wife , never so honest@@ ly spoken .
it feels great to say certain things loud , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round , we have talk about the concept of honour and how it is connected with clothing .
some women in the group have been borne by Sar@@ is only Sar@@ is .
for most of this is okay , but some wanted a sal@@ ta @-@ spa , a vast shirt over a p@@ ants , wear ; they have not d@@ ined .
according to a lot of dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own h@@ anger , the Mor@@ al associated with the Sar@@ is and a lot more , nar@@ row@@ ed Ro@@ hin@@ i its own couple of Kur@@ t@@ as ( upper arms ) into a discussion , so that women could wear them .
next they have decided now to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear je@@ ans and ro@@ hin@@ i is certain that they will be able to create it .
on the question whether in the five months since its first disc@@ us@@ ement club has already changed something , confirms that things slowly come into roles :
we have only made small steps so far .
some women have tried it a few times , but never heard again to say the name of her husband .
some , including me , make it still , but only if they are alone and no other family members are at the same time .
only one or two will continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women contribute to their foreh@@ ead .
women in the Disc@@ ussion club know that the changes that they would like to achieve in their lives - like the f@@ eil@@ ing of more freedom of movement or its own clos@@ ets - at the end of a difficult to nav@@ igi@@ ble river .
by offering each other self @-@ confidence , they shall be aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Ro@@ hin@@ i explains :
each of us is a victim of patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am too .
but this cl@@ one gives each of us the confidence that will change something .
and I know that it will not only be limited to 30 families . there will be a ch@@ ari@@ re@@ tion when any woman goes home and others about what we talk and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

it is the first time that consecutive attacks on non @-@ cat@@ chy men were registered in Moz@@ ambi@@ que .
another group that is the goal of murder for ob@@ sc@@ ure , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led that the UN 2016 lead to a mission in the South African country to investigate these intern@@ ship .
the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of the southern Africa , especially in the neighboring country , especially in the neighboring country , in order to fight this as@@ ber@@ believe and pre@@ judi@@ ces .

the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu Me@@ i @-@ n@@ u from the govern@@ ors of the Democratic Party of Party in China also called on to allow the k@@ ran@@ ial intellectual Li@@ u to allow themselves to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed himself in a statement on 28 June at Li@@ u and gave him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is my belief that the initiatives that he took and for which he was strictly pun@@ ished to a harmon@@ ious , stable and aff@@ lu@@ ent whose China had contributed to a peac@@ efully world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt personally very moved and also encourages me when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tu@@ als and interested citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and the rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question may be du@@ mm since Singapore is recognized as an independent state as an independent state .
but according to the J@@ us@@ tic@@ Minister K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am should be considered in Singapore .
this re@@ mark has triggered a debate in the Blog@@ osph@@ ere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the International Z@@ weig@@ s of the State of New York , the Minister of New York was not@@ able that many people were the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compare Singapore with other countries .
he support that Singapore should be considered as a city .
... nobody asked to be asked if New York is a democracy ...
this is it , whereby most people commit an error .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o compl@@ ett@@ ed the J@@ us@@ tiz@@ minister , &quot; to defend logic to defend the existing author@@ it@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore .
and then , according to all our efforts and sacrific@@ es , this valuable country to create , we hear that we will not be a country .

Singapore , if you are not my country , eat country is it then ?
the reasons given by Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am reasons were not very no@@ bles , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &quot; normal &quot; normal &quot; in view of whose , he appeared un@@ we@@ al@@ ous un@@ democr@@ ati@@ cally .
but he def@@ ends the idea that Singapore is compared with cities like Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently managed by a party .
these cities are democr@@ ati@@ cally .
once you reach the core point of the topic , it appears again the good old body of the author@@ it@@ arian Mach@@ th@@ ab@@ ern which will be the t@@ wi@@ sted logic , because it fits better to her power .
in the end of the last week of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ ly , answers to his American guests have given on our press , our Judi@@ k@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ responses .
corresponding questions tar@@ an with non @-@ answers of rational Art .
Rach@@ el Z@@ eng calls for Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ on to clear his opinions , since they have not understood this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to look .
when Singapore is not a country , but a city is in which country belongs to our city ...
in short , I understand nothing .
I would be very grateful if our wer@@ ter K Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am would take on the effort to un@@ clear this point when it was highly paid to be part of the government of Singapore .
by An@@ on on the blog his comment , he shows regarding the critics that one should begin to understand the entire form of the conference to better understand the context of statements by Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ gl@@ on to which Singapore was a city and no country .
read the ins@@ cription .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sei &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said why the elections in Singapore is so un@@ equally important , even if we are looking forward to free and just elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he conf@@ essing Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw decades a party ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as he said , Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously does not have it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ gl@@ am , who makes a leader of a her@@ al@@ growing generation , such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am about what the J@@ us@@ tic@@ Minister of Singapore has said , very embarrass@@ ed ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the ancient Gar@@ de what awaits me - be I agree with them or not , but this is another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes that he really believes , and aware of what he def@@ ends .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review stri@@ ves the gu@@ arded of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ ams arguments :
does Mr Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am &quot; well@@ ed an error &quot; committed or was it a fre@@ ud@@ inal failure ?
if Singapore is not a country , we will only be seen as an independent and sover@@ eign State ?
if not , on which country go the sover@@ eign rights of the city of Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city .
since he plays an important role within the government of the government , the statements made by Mr. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am of serious importance .
why do the Lon@@ urer do their military service , they defend their city but not their country ?
whom does our Prime Minister must pay rep@@ airing ?
what is the value of our pink human resources ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
that the magazine Jour@@ ney of a decade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore and has always been a city :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this set seems to have lots of wood ob@@ tain@@ er tun@@ ed ...
nobody ever had said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city - island of state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often make statements such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country especially &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that &apos;s not quite true . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should speak more of the defense of the city .
the my@@ th of the &quot; cute Can@@ adi@@ ers &quot;

scre@@ enshot from a YouTube video .
Global Vo@@ ices asked for his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect to your place of homeland or home country ?
your answers will be published here as part of a continued series , with the rum@@ ors over certain parts of the world and to be shown another fac@@ et .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ ado Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question that is put into Japan by most , is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I am sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live up and back in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is regarded as polite , interest in his inter@@ loc@@ ut@@ ors by looking for personal questions .
on my view@@ ings then follow the standard apply : &quot; Oh , Rock@@ y Mountains , Eis@@ ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Kan@@ adi@@ er cook perhaps in@@ war@@ dly ahead of anger , if they are held for Americans , but me does not distur@@ b this .
for someone who does not know , there is little that diff@@ ers from American from American .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans can bring a Canadian f@@ ahn@@ e well visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all dear Kan@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans on the other ... .
so it was already when I started to travel around 20 years ago , through the world - in front of Donald Tr@@ ump , in Iraq and the 11th September .
can@@ adi@@ ans have always supported small an@@ hor@@ n@@ elling to their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
with us there are no weapons !
in Canada has been legal in Canada since 2005 .
all seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are courteous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we say obviously very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada applies also to the toler@@ ant country toward ethnic groups .
we are not like these types at the south of the border .
we rab@@ adi@@ er are nice .
I h@@ asse that .
first , I have many American friends I very ad@@ mi@@ red .
it would make me nothing if you change me for example with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
there are also some problems with the stamp . &quot;
first , as &quot; nice , &quot; said , is basically , sp@@ ying to be - as such as the cou@@ pon , gentle , but trag@@ s@@ wise figure NED Fl@@ anders from &quot; The Simp@@ son &quot; ( which has an own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger # ) .
if Canada really would be a nation full of people like NED Fl@@ anders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; no personality has .
there is no corners and edges , nothing , where you can encounter .
harm@@ less to be un@@ ob@@ tr@@ usive and un@@ interesting and not deserve much attention .
this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , remote from the things that are around a round .
I would even go far , to say that the desire to be free and alone , a head@@ set of the Canadian ist .
we are happy to take care of our own affairs .
what out@@ si@@ ders as &quot; kind &quot; call , is perhaps just cool courtesy .
Can@@ adi@@ ans do not talk often over the fence with the neighb@@ ors .
we l@@ acks the warm , open friendliness , which I now connect with my American friends .
thank@@ fully for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then Ju@@ stin Tru@@ deau the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice &quot; are . our prime minister has Canada straight to sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ zed Thailand &apos;s Jun@@ ta
one in Thailand famous pop @-@ band has released a musical video , which the Jun@@ ta par@@ odi@@ zed that 2014 continues to reg@@ ain the power and despite their failure the civil government continues to re@@ igns the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells them that rules makes his girlfriend .
although not expressly politically , so the Musik@@ video refers to the ongoing military dom@@ ination of the Jun@@ ta .
the band has suffered from many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video of the song was a great success .
in the first three days , the video up@@ loaded Video 1.@@ 254 times was shared and received 8.@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
last month , the Charlie Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; The Boli@@ vian dict@@ ator was blocked in Thailand , after a group of activ@@ ists requested the public to look at this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics as it beh@@ aves with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at this recording of the video , which relate to some of the political issues , which have been prosec@@ uted in the past three years .
the &quot; 44 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 44 rules of girls &quot; possibly relate to the dra@@ ical section 44 of the preliminary Constitution , which granted the state @-@ out lover of the company &apos;s absolute decision making on key national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 11th rule : change your attitude &quot; refers to the in@@ breeding change &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activ@@ ists , politicians and other persons that are regarded by the Jun@@ ta as critics .
the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer cri@@ min@@ ality , whose v@@ age and un@@ clear regulations are often used by the authorities to explo@@ it activ@@ ists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit is set up in the army , the online content is monitored and persons , proj@@ ected the mon@@ archy , will be prosec@@ uted the mon@@ archy .
Thailand is a kn@@ it set against &quot; L@@ esis Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ est@@ ese ) by .
in Thailand the war was closed in Thailand .
two days later it came to a put@@ sch of the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to be prosec@@ uted is their decision co@@ stly sub@@ boats to buy , although security acts they war@@ ned that the purchase is un@@ necessary and a waste of tax ev@@ ators is .
in the video even showed how people are thrown into a black shipping car before you bring them into an inter@@ ni@@ fying camp , another problem .
some journalists are sitting in prison , because they supp@@ os@@ edly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in the society and they are being accessed a long imprison@@ ment , they should be bel@@ ei@@ ved the mon@@ archy .
meanwhile , the Te@@ aser of the songs members of the band who were the Sal@@ ute of &quot; The tri@@ bute of panic , who has already been used by Put@@ sch opponents during the protests in 2014 .

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with friendly permission .
the post @-@ war company reco@@ vered only very slowly in East @-@ East Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al district .
now it has been over 20 years since the Georgi@@ an @-@ ch@@ re war was officially ended , but its s@@ cars are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic .
the des@@ erted villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show marking images .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ ht@@ a , Poly@@ ana and Khar@@ chil@@ ava are located in the coal basin of ab@@ ch@@ asi@@ es .
various ethnic groups such as Rus@@ sians , Gre@@ eks , At@@ tor@@ es , Georgi@@ an and Armenia lived and worked together to be present in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , for the largest part Rus@@ sians and ch@@ ases in the area .
such settlements are called in Ab@@ ch@@ Asia as well as host@@ ages .
in the pre@@ historic times there lived more than 10,000 people , today there are only a few hundred people in these spirits .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 the overall population of the district 16,@@ 000 people , after they had hardly increased over a decade .
1989 lived about 4@@ 25,@@ 000 people in this district .

the empty five @-@ story buildings of the Soviet Union from the early 60@@ s , called the Chr@@ us@@ tsch@@ uk@@ ov@@ kas , symbo@@ lic of the pre@@ cip@@ itation and the devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are negl@@ ected and quite rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he begins a conversation and it falls difficult to finish this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything is a result of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; why ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is nevertheless clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in front of war the village was full of life .
there were municipal centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , all of the community .
now there is only paved road with inflatable mag@@ nific@@ ence @-@ buildings .
people who were once lived in this place and their contribution to the central management sector of the Soviet Union , have left the district .
in the Gei@@ ster@@ stadt D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha live approximately fifty residents .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the Chr@@ us@@ tsch@@ ow@@ ai , which is still one or two families , one can recognize in the balconies where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
as they discover me with the camera in the hand they are immediately going back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Mother has forbidden that we leave us photo@@ graph , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is simply forbidden for us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl fl@@ ang@@ ed her girlfriend something to and suddenly leave them the destroyed buildings and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small tur@@ quoise mining companies called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ ug@@ ol .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence industry ( cultivation of nation@@ alities ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable @-@ cultivation .
it is difficult to come about the l@@ aps .
the District management provides free candles and bread to the villages .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build al@@ c@@ ch@@ ini &quot;
about ten years ago an older woman moved with the name Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt ) just as they called in the neighbourhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ k@@ ha .
despite their oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina does not live in front of ab@@ bey , in order to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in ab@@ ch@@ asi@@ es , &quot; she tells them .
Gal@@ ina wants to accept no financial assistance from her daughter and dis@@ si@@ eves that they are instead supported their young grand@@ son .
Gal@@ inas monthly R@@ ente are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you do not have a mixture , nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; is they too .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
if holidays are , we visit us .
but we cannot do this - everybody is busy with his own problems . &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighb@@ our on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ asch@@ a , &quot; calls a@@ unt . &quot; you said , we could build al@@ c@@ ch@@ ini .
I have already prepared the ground .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build al@@ c@@ ch@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; one can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as talks with her husband and the five common children in their house lived for some time .
Nat@@ asch@@ a was 11 years old when the war began .
every day they remember the thorn of war before the war .
despite the relatives that live in Central Russian , Os@@ se@@ tien and Georgia live ( the country of Ab@@ ch@@ Asia broke off ) , they had not the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recently purchased the country in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative data in Ab@@ ch@@ asi@@ es ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to build a house there , but this will still take some , &quot; explains them re@@ en@@ sible .
so@@ asch@@ a receives a $ 9 child per child .
your man works in the age of coal .
the young family has its own farm .
in the vicinity of the house , where Nat@@ asch@@ as kinder@@ garten once was there , they hold pig@@ s , cows , t@@ aps and ch@@ ick@@ ens .
she tells us that it was initially a very fr@@ ighten@@ ing situation , when lots of people left the village after the war .
but over time they lost their hopes .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that this buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it has more likely to do with plur@@ alism .
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right .
I remember every day , like the city and the war once were . &quot;
when our talk is t@@ ends to the end , a little boy takes over us past .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies from the window and another boy J@@ ew him back .
he plays with the ball , which then hin@@ oc@@ ated the hills .
a group children are now persec@@ uted the ball .
while they run , some of them stones are on the refined building .
these ruins are part of her childhood , which care for inj@@ usti@@ ce in their lives .

in Mexico there is home &quot; m@@ um Africa &quot; migrants on their long journey
Conc@@ ep@@ ción Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez leads to a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by Amy brac@@ ken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org , and appears here with friendly permission .
on the way of migrants , Europe or Latin America will cross certain places for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by an 59@@ - year @-@ ol@@ ds , a small woman with a cor@@ al @-@ pink br@@ ill@@ eng@@ est@@ ell and gold @-@ col@@ oured ear@@ rings in Ted@@ dy@@ b@@ ular shape .
it is called Conc@@ ep@@ ción Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and has grown up there . nevertheless they know many under the name of Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tian , which are on the passage .
the hotel has rather no charm .
for about 2,50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with K@@ ahlen , cr@@ um@@ bled walls and beds made of metal .
in advance there is a par@@ rot in a c@@ age .
there is no Way@@ showers to the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez come the people in full small bus@@ hes , and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call : &quot; m@@ um Africa !
where are you M@@ um Africa ? &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet but this year was Ram@@ í@@ rez already 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept on Kart@@ ons .
she does not want to reject any one .
she also helps them and brings them to hospital when they are sick , they purchases them drugs that they cannot pay , they mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ m that has exhausted from the long trip .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived at a short time .
I asked him if Mama was a reasonable name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , which has a j@@ og@@ che@@ sta@@ che ) posi@@ ts with Conc@@ ep@@ ción Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy brac@@ elet .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; reply he with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it fits , as African women are very nice women .
very lov@@ ingly .
she has the cordi@@ ality of a mother ...
we are very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ an@@ ew with his sister , the hopes to get to Boston to reach her husband and the three children .
you already lived in Brazil , however , it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America , then move toward north .
the family had heard by other departure from Mama Africa . &quot; m@@ um Africa is a well known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Mich@@ elet , a guest from Haiti .
he tells us that the shar@@ eholder and the Afri@@ cans often travel together the route and that the Afri@@ cans were already talking to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
as many of his departure has out@@ going on Mich@@ elet has lived in Brazil and has worked as a building workers at the building of the Olympic Games and the football World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was we@@ aker , he started his journey into the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa : he sold SI@@ M cards to save the necessary money to buy the cri@@ cket to Ti@@ ju@@ ana .
I wonder if he is in the future with Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez contact .
&quot; M@@ om Africa is our mother and we never let them go again , &quot; reply he sm@@ iling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells you that their guests can send their many times text messages , when they proceed to gr@@ anting them or to report about their journey over the course of their journey .
she explains that her Christian faith of the drive of their work is .
they do not know a lot about Africa , but their guests have their own , ch@@ ick@@ ens as in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known , but it is not the only spar@@ k hope for migrants that travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ ela .
in this winter , Valen@@ ela and his family have taken migrants in their small house .
he is Poli@@ z@@ ist and has found that the B@@ usti@@ ckets are sold to many African migrants .
he began to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar spent the night .
at the moment are 25 people there , mainly Hai@@ tian .
some sleeping on blank@@ ets on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a kitchenette outside .
Valen@@ z@@ ela explained that he knows what the guests make up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I experienced what they experience . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others not help . this is the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was transferred to a raid in his work place from the United States .
the majority of migrants that travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cord@@ ova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he bra@@ ve in Honduras with his wife and his three children who wanted to spend the money by him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he was asked for an accommodation and a unknown , a solo @-@ making , has offered him their roof .
some months later the family lives still there and they tried to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
in the g@@ ways s@@ ulate the passengers quiet her tel@@ eph@@ ones .
a small bus arrived today and has got 20 new guests , a large proportion of Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy about that their house is full , but it is also no@@ stal@@ gic , because of those who went away .
as a st@@ ol@@ ze grand@@ mother b@@ lows them in their album with numerous photos .
there are one of her daughter with African hair@@ dres@@ ser who has made her a customer in , some photos of their grand@@ children and many travellers more , young and old ones .
they have sad , while they put them briefly before me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ya se fu@@ eron &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is repeated every time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you already have gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install on their mobile phones to install a surveillance app .
a check @-@ point for personal communication units in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang by Twitter @-@ users
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , a ethnic minorities region in the West of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on 10 July received the mobile @-@ users in Tian@@ sh@@ an district of the city of Ur@@ um@@ qi a mobile phone @-@ notification , in which it points the district government , a surveillance app called Sch@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the release message is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get access to terror@@ ist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonom@@ ous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because they had installed shortly after they had installed the app , messages exchanged with a private We@@ chat group .
in the release of the police force , that the app will determine the sources and the distri@@ butions of the terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ books and documents .
a Jing@@ An website describes the app as follows :
Jing@@ w@@ ang is a protective cover with a system @-@ categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ u@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main function is the block@@ ers of por@@ no@@ graphic websites , by online fraud , Tro@@ jan and ph@@ ishing pages to make users informed about how much time they are online and to control your own home network .
this app with the filters for min@@ ors should help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can naturally be used in a wide variety of ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; state actors or even h@@ ackers were to manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or ste@@ al .
this introduction is consistent with other measures to take control of the digital activities in this region .
while reports about digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China usually concentrate on the experiences of users in the major cities in the East and south , the reality is very often d@@ ü@@ er for those who live in remote , mut@@ ually ethnic min@@ ors and Tibetan regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit dis@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in the conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme c@@ ens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as an rout@@ ing Internet cir@@ cuits .

this is a proposal for the technological development .
they have forced the people forced , devices that are meant for older people to use .
this is a form of cap@@ tivity through the ber@@ watch@@ strap .

sleep or death , part 1 : anything dirty to death

this is the first of six reports in series &quot; sleep or death &quot; in which of activity is Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane his experiences in an Syrian prison .
far from our blue , virtual world , you look at you and you realize that you are completely alone at a place where all Import@@ ant disappeared .
everything has turned according to and gradually , and revealed a truth which clearly recogni@@ z@@ able , both from the inside and outside .
one that makes their name all glory .
one who has to feel into a list of feelings and pull @-@ out who do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
but when you get the reality again and you are behind the scenes - beyond the scenes , the beautiful scen@@ eries and the per@@ former - transform the characters into being of flesh and blood , and all sh@@ eit to death .
all doubts solve themselves in smoke and you will be aware of your existence even if the earth are caught up on the axis of the un@@ healing . you will clear that you are here between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone they have built in stone .
they have arrested me and my Father three times , but that was still not yet so I believe &quot; my dis@@ infection &quot; how the chef of the security team is form@@ ulated - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he put his power over us among us by even the easi@@ est concepts destroyed , which we knew .
five young people were destroyed during a peaceful prot@@ ests as we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our Revolution .
it comes from so that the city the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ ectable &quot; -@@ Schrei@@ en .
all city district co@@ v@@ eted , just my own not .
for the first time it was still , rainy , at the wrong time , even though I had no high demands placed on a city which has been made up to the ar@@ ter@@ ies with state safety @-@ organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
the third night had a little cal@@ med down things after the power supply in the quarter .
I crossed the still@@ ness by passing several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ able &quot; of my pet@@ ri@@ ach from prescribed e .
I heard my voice through the silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt enough to see together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends locked up to me ; we con@@ formed to a wonderful picture that filled my expectations completely and filled .
in such a moment you realize that you are be@@ ad the spirit from the lamp , but it is not interested in the s@@ caff@@ ol@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; makes you ready to meet with the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he placed on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you down , - nothing can give you your voice , after you put your way up to the office of the Security service from the ly@@ b .
I came there .
the only gh@@ gh@@ an stood there with several of his men : my father was already there , as I now also .
the Ob@@ j@@ gh@@ an starts to speak : &quot; let me listen to me like you &apos; Al@@ ahu Ak@@ ectable , or you are only mu@@ d enough to cry , if we are not nearby . &quot;
his has@@ n @-@ filled eyes set up on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you gri@@ ef you what to look at my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did , has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building .
perhaps it was in my go@@ at , E@@ it@@ el@@ ty ; perhaps on the revolution .
I was so sure to me , when I said , &quot; I would not thought that you have forgotten my voice again since yesterday .
and I believe I have never heard in the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the short@@ est entertainment that such a fat@@ al consequences for me could have , and yet regret I was not a word of what I told .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is him equal in solo and his father equally with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; his father is equal to this . &quot;
the st@@ ench of this piece of proposition is to me today in the nose .
he became a &quot; syn@@ drome , &quot; a se@@ el@@ ic torture that I was exposed to monthly .
I cross the yard .
in the first office I leave everything I am with myself .
then again through the farm and the second office which leads through a hallway to the individual cells .
I like all the details exactly before I prepare the room .
otherwise , they probably have a greater cell .
I have to share it with just one another cap@@ ees , and may immediately put me away , without waiting for their permission .
after a few minutes you felt like a whole life , left the officials , and I handle on an old @-@ proven communication method : with the Faust against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my z@@ ach@@ gen@@ os@@ se was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; salvation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long time he rep@@ lied to me .
apparently there was none of the surrounding cells a appropri@@ ated man middle ages that is similar to me and called &quot; the doctrine called &quot; Dok@@ tor &quot; is called .
in the perfection of darkness there are no mark@@ ers of visions , and doctors do not exist here ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; perhaps a man whose voice sounds like my sounds ? &quot;
all the answers have a existence .
perhaps he was transferred into one of the great cells .
maybe he will immediately hear .
the Medi@@ ator had me assured , they would release him when I stay .
li@@ ar .
I would like to have a bird @-@ bird I had to distribute all these cranes in the morning in the garden of my head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance I still hear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be about 10 am in the evening ; always around this time w@@ ns the writer , every day .
the door opens itself .
I was always convinced that the color of the desire is , until I saw the yellow light that took us the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( e.g. : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; painting on 13 S@@ ure of the Quran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to hear &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was the secret to protect the state security in front of us and prevent us to put the ob@@ li@@ que and the terrorists in us , speak her con@@ dens@@ ation and ri@@ pped the close point of view of their world view .
this is not a house , which is here is not a country ; it is a cur@@ se to call it co@@ existence to transform the crime of their K@@ lan@@ s into a hero .
I care the mixing and tre@@ ads at Abu I@@ mad , a slim and st@@ us@@ k man ; at least he comes to me so before .
he begins a &quot; pleasant &quot; Con@@ vers@@ ation , despite the fac@@ ial expres@@ sions , which will ent@@ ail him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can join as much more important with your life than to prot@@ est these day@@ s@@ akes and to prot@@ est on demonstrations which will soon be an end soon . &quot;
I rep@@ lied .
I used to get an acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to answer .
I really cannot say exactly when ins@@ ults and b@@ lows after a friendly conversation for me to become an ordinary communication instrument .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to be reconc@@ iled at ease or cur@@ es to be pun@@ ished , although I had nothing to earn this punishment .
in punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to t@@ ear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the lov@@ ingly &quot; gest@@ ant . &quot;
it begins with a plastic pipe , which comes probably from the monastery .
your H@@ enk@@ er moves to your cry .
give him the pleasure , you can not measure yourself with him and you can &apos;t hold your cry .
my cry were not enough , why they ex@@ ed the tube by a cable fl@@ ex@@ ited .
in my first release , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had worked once more as g@@ arb@@ age coll@@ ects or if that was the normal working capacity .
they had four cable pul@@ led to each other to present us from their point of view , great in@@ vention of a huge cable .
within one hour there are rarely three of them while I still have been on the row .
I had any feeling lost in my body - and even my voice , why I stopped to write .
the H@@ enk@@ er not@@ te the dro@@ pping and found none in it , why he used to become a electri@@ cally at a electri@@ cally at hand .
flow through my entire body , enough to store my whole district .
my semi @-@ snack body , the spread over the ground was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
this must be probably like mid@@ night .
I decided to sleep me again ; let &apos;s say , that was my only option .
some hours left , who came to me as minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
the door opens and the morning fills the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I set up with the voice of a exhausted young people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father must be fr@@ ighten@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; be silent and away you , you will be embarrass@@ ed . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always been un@@ released .
where do they conduct myself ? !
the j@@ ord@@ an Rap@@ per Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b re@@ det on the rights of LGB@@ T T@@ Q + -@@ community , free expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigar@@ ette in his studio .
the photo was taken from A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sp@@ ends the bulk of his time hi@@ inside , he fl@@ att@@ ened to his canvas , to his computer , and again to his couch .
but what can be left , is a cigar@@ ette between his fingers or his with nic@@ otine to discover .
he lives on the top floor of his family house which has been forced to them since 1967 ; the year , in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family looked into Palestine by their village in Palestine where they had lived as fel@@ ah@@ y@@ een ( e.g. : Far@@ mer ) .
for six years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is a passionate activ@@ ist who presents itself the conserv@@ ative majority , and their alt@@ proven opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and free expression by art and rap@@ e .
with his music , which often deals with themes such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation Palestinian conflict . all these issues are not only in his hom@@ etown Am@@ man relief , but also in cities that we@@ aken from Damascus in Syria to San@@ aa in Y@@ emen .
with its 25 years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees itself as someone who is not restricted by borders and he can feel according to their own statement with the people who suffer from the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign interventions in countries like Iraq , the Y@@ emen , Syria and Libya .
even if he didn &apos;t open it to US foreign policy for US foreign policy .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by author .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in the war , anything with his identity as &quot; Palestinian th@@ eter of the second generation - so he himself was born himself , even if he was born in Jordan , and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think of my own life conditions so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; empha@@ sizes h@@ d@@ ai@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then he adds : &quot; I think that I am a man , while he re@@ mun@@ er@@ ated in water , Nes@@ café in two cups . it is the holy month of Ramad@@ an ; at this time it is for Muslims , from sunrise until sund@@ own .
the j@@ ord@@ an law also signi@@ fies that the public consumption of food during Ramad@@ an illegal is illegal .
obviously , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a s@@ eng@@ aging hot young day little with prot@@ est against Islam .
basically the mos@@ quit@@ ous coffee and the sc@@ ales of the K@@ ent @-@ cigar@@ ette in the nose is first line of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially if you th@@ rows a look into the neighbouring countries .
from therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as to drink in the public during Ramad@@ an of water - to do not land in prison .
recently , the German Federal Ministry of Jordan took a appearance of the band Mas@@ h@@ rou &apos; L@@ eil@@ a , already for the second time .
some parliament@@ arians , who support the Islamic Ak@@ tions@@ front - ar@@ gu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual fron@@ tier Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , the cultural and traditional standards of the country contradi@@ cts and the main reason for the concert .
the members and former Pres@@ entation of the Islamic coalition DI@@ MA Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with C@@ NN that the concert was &quot; especially &quot; because of the sexual orientation of the proposition .
many also claim that the dedication of the band in matters like the Arab Spring , human rights and free expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which represents the out@@ proven legitim@@ acy of author@@ it@@ arian regimes throughout the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a public statement estimated Mas@@ h@@ rou &apos; L@@ eil@@ a the j@@ ord@@ an people as &quot; progressive suppor@@ ter of human rights &quot; one who continues to use &quot; for an intellectual and cultural plur@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this statement is likely to be not easy to sei@@ zed rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , but in fact a deeper recognition of reality in Jordan , which occurs in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs works clearly to the occurr@@ ence .
in 2016 completed h@@ d@@ ai@@ b traditional sex@@ es to be suffering by bringing his vision of the fate of Arab women , pre@@ domin@@ ating sex .
the picture shows the sk@@ elet@@ on of a clearly lower woman whose arms and legs turn up to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red sea ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who lost their lives through the hands of those who actually have confidence .
in the past few years , the number of &apos; Ehr@@ en@@ mor@@ de &apos; has increased greatly from the official outside of the &apos; Ehr@@ en@@ mor@@ de &apos; .
human Rights Watch present the number of hon@@ ors in 2016 their climax ; however still appears that Jordan is missing to have the institutional infrastructure around the women who were victims of murder and domestic violence in appropriate manner .
according to a law of bl@@ az@@ ing control from 1954 , women who are exposed to in@@ tra @-@ family violence , &quot; to un@@ certain time in prison , &quot; and for their release is often a prolong@@ ed bureaucr@@ atic effort as well as the guarantee of the family , that the woman will happen nothing .
also H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs music enjoys great pop@@ ularity and is known for that , also not before subject to retreat , which in his country long as tab@@ u g@@ old .
h@@ d@@ ai@@ b tre@@ ad that his work was politically , but sp@@ ati@@ t however , that he cannot part his music , which is full of exp@@ on@@ ites to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , not by politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I com@@ m from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I have entered politics , he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a song called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; takes the question of the Palestinian identity in the attack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in &quot; Lav@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; is the focus on poverty .
the list of the songs that are in the core politically , makes it further .
in March 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b released a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is often repeated :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and every other is it too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the further course of the song , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a sort of market where you can get in his words , &quot; that is what you want , - be it faith or non @-@ believe , h@@ et@@ ero@@ or hom@@ osexu@@ ality .
he noticed that hardly any anyone in Jordan , talks about the rights of g@@ ay and les@@ bian people and that comments to equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + -@@ individuals are still very strong in 2014 .
in 2014 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b an interview conducted for the popular j@@ ord@@ an Onlin@@ e@@ Program Ro@@ ya to remember that his comments from the context was devast@@ ated , and his opinion had been c@@ ens@@ ored .
&quot; on Youtube it was not up@@ loaded without a cuts , but he was only a edited version , &quot; says he .
today H@@ d@@ ai@@ b open to the arab@@ ic LGB@@ T T@@ Q + -@@ community and represents the opinion that intoler@@ ance towards hom@@ osexu@@ als does not speak to Islam .
he mentioned Abu Nu@@ ts , a po@@ et of the eighth century , which is still alive today thanks to its hom@@ o@@ erotic po@@ ems .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks itself : if Abu Nu@@ what was to work later on behalf of the Cali@@ br@@ ace , in the eighth century , openly about hom@@ osexu@@ ality could write , why can
the real problem , so h@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with Mas@@ h@@ rou &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fas@@ hi@@ emi@@ ah &apos;s kingdom there is nothing more that the government attacks on freedom of expression and brought that progressive votes to silence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet recently , in January 2017 , the j@@ ord@@ an news service took several former government agencies and members of the teaching feder@@ ation , with the grounds , they had expressed themselves on comments in social media , that sur@@ passed with the deep in the land of ro@@ oted corruption .
in view of what is the concert of H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs , according to the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to achieve a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan .
for him progress is a continuous name and Take . Jordan , Mas@@ h@@ rou &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a now has been hon@@ ored for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - is made of slow , pro@@ claim and inner changes . he is certain that these changes from day to day in the heart of the Iran@@ ian society .
ultimately , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , but also from an Arab world without interventions from abroad .
he does not only dre@@ amed of it , his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of them to experience them . &quot;
perhaps the region is using music , art and literature of real and fundamental openness - and not by bom@@ bs , stretching and an artificial nature led . at least ho@@ w@@ he that he .
until it is far , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will pass further folders and thus also res@@ ign@@ ing resistance .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
this large , ex@@ trav@@ ag@@ ants war are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
one assumed that there is a variant of Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually observed in August in many areas To@@ ho@@ cus . another theory was built , in the ar@@ mies of the West of Japan in the north @-@ east , around the indigenous people of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , into the kne@@ es .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to pick up a few great si@@ ves , so we have a super view .
one can only imagine how large those parts are ...
a common centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ monthly exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) .
I saw me again for a long time again the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en : two fixed cars are just visible .
nevertheless , for many people who take to A@@ om@@ ori the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival das merely a stunning way to spend the summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; summer festival in the north of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was there and I wat@@ ched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meters high feast @-@ car was amazing .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

rare was outer appearance and body care so important as in this story , because they help keep the Peru@@ vian youth of cri@@ min@@ ality and to promote a legiti@@ mate profession like the bar@@ ri@@ eurs .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us major port , located on the coast of the Pacific ocean , close to the historical center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street ro@@ b and illegal drugs are everyday .
one in April 2017 survey showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not be safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthe@@ tic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and thus also the outside hair@@ styles of famous sport@@ s@@ men like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to be more and more standardization in the experienced hands of hair@@ dressers you can follow @-@ up hair@@ styles .
the un@@ preced@@ ented demand for hair@@ styles , who go to the utmost limits of imagination and creativity , even an annual event inspired by the hair@@ style of hair@@ dressers : Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 .
there are experts about each other , to show who from them the ec@@ cent@@ es L@@ ooks , how to see in the following video ( see more videos on current competitions on the public Facebook @-@ profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , found here an opportunity to persu@@ ade young people to persu@@ ade their weapons against hair@@ dres@@ sing tools and instead of bad ratings .
motiv@@ ated from this activity and the resulting possibilities have seen the do@@ z@@ ens of young people that they can gra@@ b a profession that is currently in fashion .

the following article is the revised version of the entry &quot; love message to Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ak@@ er@@ fer , &quot; which released the international online magazine Tea after T@@ wel@@ ve .
this contribution will be published here within the context of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we just write love to people who we know ?
is it not yet many more important , people who feel broad@@ ened , affection .
exactly this question went out the two young Colom@@ bian activ@@ ists of Leonardo P@@ ár@@ rag@@ a by the Stiftung Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os by the Young @-@ Youth Foundation is no longer out of the head and inspir@@ ing it to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la R@@ econ@@ ci@@ li@@ ación ( letters to re@@ conciliation ) , the young people to write too .
only in short was her country @-@ place of a historical event and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had a peace agreement with the Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ab@@ ew@@ end F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces in Colombia ) , which forms the long@@ itude of the lon@@ gest armed conflict in Latin America .
international was considered the sign@@ atories of the Peace Treaty , as important that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel San@@ tos for his meri@@ ts received the peace prize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in front of the Kolum@@ bi@@ ans there is a long way to speak of a real re@@ conciliation and of peace . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gu@@ err@@ illa fought for many years in illegal bearings have been exposed to a war rh@@ rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic and around the clock , and now have to integrate their weapons upon life as civilians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Colom@@ bian company in turn , who had acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to life in constant fear and in some cases , she has to record them in their ranks and support them in building a new life .
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bian people would have to connect and help with the integration process .
and that is exactly what they did so , until now , thousands of young people wrote po@@ e - love message to former gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ers to welcome them back in society .
the goal of the campaign are 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ers who should be handed over to personally .
the Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letter re@@ conciliation was founded on the World Summit of the No@@ bel Peace Conference , which took place in February 2017 in Bog@@ ot@@ á . there were Leonardo and Cr@@ istian the opportunity to talk briefly to K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ ar@@ th@@ i in February 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this said that we love the people that we love , am Valentine &apos;s thousands of love , but those who forget that they need much needed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is planning , he told he continued to share his love with people who needed most urgent addition to the urgent addition .
thus , the plan , letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC to write their place in society and build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian company is ready to make the dis@@ course of a war history to a common history of peace .
so far in the campaign of the campaign was collected more than 2000 letters .
the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ín , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Barran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never thought that someone would for@@ give me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March at one of the UN stock in the Cal@@ don@@ o region .
a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ i@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the foundation of Bog@@ ot@@ al , to transfer the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC set itself so on how they had done earlier to take the commands of their leaders .
but this time they received no commands , but letters full of under@@ s@@ ation of people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings you can walk in just a few hours - from fear through to happiness and everything that is between , &quot; told the political scienti@@ st Manuela Jim@@ é@@ nez Av@@ ila later .
Sandra par@@ ra , a collabor@@ ator of the Govern@@ ors of the province Valle del Cau@@ ca describe this unforgettable experience as follows :
after we have handed over the letters , gave me a former f@@ ighter through the camp of Gu@@ er@@ illa @-@ fighters .
when I live in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ act living ) saw I saw a gu@@ er@@ ill@@ act , who wrote something .
I had afraid to go down , for next to him on the bed lay a M@@ GL @-@ pom@@ eg@@ rowing , a fat@@ al weapon in the village of Dor@@ n@@ rö@@ schen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I talked to him , and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hello , what do they just ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I entered into a letter that someone has written me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful full letter .
never in my life someone has written something so beautiful , so I went on to it . &quot; that suddenly took me the t@@ ears about the che@@ eks .
I sh@@ arm@@ ing him completely and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ rowing .
perhaps he was tired of sorry , was sorry , all the years of the faithful companion of this f@@ ailing to be , and wanted to help him to write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never had something else of life than war , was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers in front of fam@@ ine . &quot; I never thought that anyone would for@@ give me for my mistake .
but now I know that there is outside a society that is waiting with open arms for us .
until now I just learned how I have to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace re@@ igns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices
for the pr@@ el@@ ude of students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC come together with a discussion .
the students were all grown as already war a war and the F@@ ARC had already committed in sec@@ rec@@ y .
therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC the history of the organization , its ide@@ als and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; many years we have experienced how the social inj@@ usti@@ ce on the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can contribute to creating society in this country .
for a goal of this order , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them .
Manuela was impressed :
these people heard who have never heard heard and had no elect@@ oral heard , and to recognize that people who often have seen as Monster and even hate , even people who were shot by their living conditions and their environment was very pain@@ ful for me .
the reality , in which the country lives , does me s@@ ick@@ ed .
but it com@@ for@@ ted me that all men - even those who killed and so much damage to bring us something and give a smile and a hug .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the command@@ ant of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Arch@@ bishop of the City of Cal@@ i , following letter :
the colum@@ bi@@ ans were prop@@ hesi@@ ed that after dra@@ fting peace would reign .
but this is not the case .
as long as it inequality , hunger and a lack of education , health care and employment possibilities , there will always give people who are willing to access weapons and to prot@@ est their rights . and this is also completely justified ( ... ) .
we from the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , in a policy without arms .
that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace on - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong@@ ed to rise above all those who dream of a country at war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring victims , because we know from own experience that nothing is simple . those among us who will defend the life as the basis of existence , many difficulties are represented .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

hom@@ osexu@@ als and qu@@ e@@ ere people who live in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region , are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with hor@@ ri@@ ors , activ@@ ists have experienced the coverage of the last few months on the persecution of the persecution of Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat , the as a di@@ amo@@ kl@@ es@@ worth over the d@@ ort@@ al LGB@@ T@@ Q @-@ community depends not only on the night .
OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny who have shared some of their experiences with us and talked about what is happening in the Republic .
the LGB@@ T humor in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has published several months ahead of several months ago , after the reports published , torture and pot@@ tery craft men in the Republic of thematic .
the first report was published by journ@@ alist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gas@@ eta ; she cast a light on the methods of Ch@@ echen authorities , the sus@@ pic@@ ious men and took them in secret pr@@ isons into ar@@ gun .
&quot; they have brought a Monster to the World &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ wife , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
ever since her childhood she is noticeable that she was in reality a woman .
when they grow , it became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya is not a safe place for them , why they went to Moscow .
after a group Ch@@ ech@@ ens experienced by the sexual stimulation of her land@@ lady , the hunting was opened on Sab@@ rina .
out of fear for their lives she moved to the US in the United States .
Sab@@ rina : I was active as volunteers at a human rights organization .
one day was told me that anyone need my help .
it was a friend from Dag@@ est@@ an , a trans@@ wife , which was put into trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , made someone , from which I thought , he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them anywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Ch@@ echen people , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos made by my documents through the whole of W@@ hat@@ s@@ app the round .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
when I have just been doing a few shopping mile from the seat of my cars , I heard a male @-@ tim@@ me : &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
when I turned to myself , I feel something in my body , but I did nothing .
then I heard a sentence , but this time at Ch@@ echen : &quot; how long do you still want to honor the family , you dis@@ grace ? &quot;
I knew the person not .
I just know that there was a young man , no 30 years old .
then I lost the consciousness and the final end in the hospital again .
apparently , some women had received everything and starting to write .
the man was bra@@ ve .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two stit@@ ch in my right pul@@ s@@ ant .
OC Media : in which cy@@ lin@@ ders were you laid - in the men or the women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is my male name dr@@ on : but the doctor rose up and put me to the women .
I am very grateful for this .
when I read his name for the first time in his office door , I got it with the fear ; it was a mus@@ cular name .
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him that he is resp@@ ect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
last February I got threats .
she called me to me , wrote me - relatives , stran@@ ger , some completely unknown .
this was the beginning of a night@@ time .
my family was attended by neighb@@ ors and some remote relative .
the slow@@ ed me to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all that was a lie .
they set absurd demands : some said to me , I will show it by the streets over the streets ; others wanted that I had changed on the official TV in Gros@@ ny and tell me that I was not changed my sex , that everything was only fl@@ aw@@ ful , and Photoshop .
I have bask@@ ets size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still hard for them .
some older men spoke of my mother in the street .
they said to her , &quot; You have brought a mon@@ ster to the world that not only has your family , but the whole republic is ash@@ amed .
we cannot tell you because you are a fro@@ m@@ me woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother was too much and she placed himself a stri@@ ck around the neck .
luck@@ ily the neighb@@ ors come and squ@@ ee@@ zed them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window a car with ab@@ patient shut@@ ters , and a numer@@ ical sign@@ board with a 95 dr@@ ill .
having happened for the third time I was clear that there was something la@@ zy .
my human @-@ legal friends over@@ thre@@ w the numbers - it turned out that I was prosec@@ uted .
OC Media : how did you add ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activ@@ ists .
of security reasons I want to make their name not reason@@ ably , but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help I left the land , but then it did something un@@ belief .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SI@@ M card to get my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought it without register , without de@@ jo@@ vice , without hes@@ itation .
I break my old SI@@ M card and cast them into the tr@@ ash .
came to and check@@ out into the hotel .
the number was on a stran@@ ger .
I put the SI@@ M card into my mobile phone .
in the moment when I wanted to inv@@ oke my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ app , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t think about , you he@@ st in security , just because you have left the country ?
our people already know in what Hotel du st@@ eck@@ st . you even know your z@@ imm@@ ick .
only to prove to you : it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
this was actually my cell number .
OC Media : do you still have contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we do not talk about lovemaking strength , however , this is a tab@@ topic .
some traditionally cold @-@ Cau@@ cas@@ ual elements can still be found in me .
so much I wish to do it , this se@@ el@@ ic barrier can I do not overcome .
I say that , as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them .
when we mo@@ cks with camera , I actually give me trouble like the person who remem@@ bered them from their past - so on my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what are your friends who have stayed the location ?
Sab@@ rina : I have filed a report in Washington last week .
for the need I used up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I sp@@ ake with someone that has ended up the lon@@ es@@ half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told us that during Ramad@@ an cannot be arrested and fil@@ tered , but also that all the end of Ramad@@ an could hardly wait until the end of Ramad@@ an , and he closed a new wave .
most likely they will focus on family and relatives .
in this way , my family , they probably invite the relatives , they take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end request a proof that the so called &quot; honour &quot; by blood has experienced .
OC Media : are now even s@@ co@@ il men in these mysterious results ?
Sab@@ rina : a well known by me it would not be very many .
if then , above all such , who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives were to make Kad@@ y@@ rows court .
as far as I know , they will be arrested there so that you can present them later as terrorists .
say : should they be changed , they will show off their body on TV and claim , they would have not been attacked your village or military support .
do you understand ?
as if these people have not simply gone , but targeted , in order to radi@@ ate themselves .
OC Media : is now only a mut@@ ation or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I have just had someone who was cat@@ ap@@ ed for a half months in Ar@@ mag@@ azin .
he says that many people disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ard was grown .
there was since then nothing new of them .
they have simply taken them .
and that so called Lord , this person was taken upon himself as these people were with@@ drawn .
but until now they were not presented as Ban@@ di@@ ts , there were not yet any reports . we tast@@ ed that such actions are not possible .
why nobody would have not allowed these people to shave themselves ?
know if these persec@@ utions and performances of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , already in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I carried my hair already long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already known all around Gros@@ ny when I still lived there - and I never had any problems .
in the Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the sh@@ aria was considered , I never had problems .
on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia was originally wanted to lead us to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ci@@ tiz@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but finally gave us back into the St@@ one@@ age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sh@@ aria Law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were exhausted , I had fil@@ med eyelashes , carried the tube je@@ ans and short t@@ ops .
the safety of the sh@@ aria has never met me only one hair .
in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me met .
it was a small place where several ben@@ ches were standing , and the whole town knew why men knew why men , young people , there met .
we have never been pre@@ ached .
in the Ch@@ echen language there is a re@@ use : Khar@@ da ma Khar@@ da . this means : &quot; Sp@@ otte does not say about the un@@ happiness of another . &quot;
it is often said to children if they make yourself about sick .
OC Media : so they simply have their eyes up before you , because they believed , you be sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never met me , never ended and never be@@ aten .
OC Media : how long did these mercy seat ?
Sab@@ rina : so long , to Kad@@ y@@ ro@@ v to the Plan appeared .
when he was appointed Minister of Prime Minister , he began to speak on TV over Mor@@ al .
he spoke not about us by se , but pre@@ dominant about the behavior of women .
nevertheless - you could feel like the people in the city started to change .
who@@ ever suffered and had suffered , see you at once with Arg@@ ile .
in the time I left Ch@@ ech@@ enia .
but every time I came back home , I was able to feel the situation in the Republic constantly .
OC Media : what activity do you go to ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I &apos;d not have a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the US .
that being said , I am still working as an activ@@ ist .
at the moment I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of Psych@@ ologist .
we organize teac@@ up , assem@@ ble , I share them to hospital and hel@@ fe them to get es@@ tic@@ cards to them .
I have no c@@ ents for it .
I have discovered these people themselves when I fled from sor@@ te .
I am Muslims and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : wear a Hid@@ de@@ de ?
Sab@@ rina : this is al@@ ing@@ ing .
so nature is that purely has nothing to do with religion .
that is exactly the same as Ch@@ echn@@ enen , who want to make yourself with foam in front of the mouth , that there are no g@@ ay on them .
the Dag@@ est@@ ans have which the Cab@@ ard@@ ine have which Rus@@ sians have also what the Rus@@ sians do they have - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it is to me uncomfortable , sow@@ ing .
I meet here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practic@@ ing Muslims , who go into the mosque , and during the Ramad@@ an - live with men together .
know , many think of Tran@@ si@@ denti@@ ty on men who love men and they believe that you change his sex , to make more intimate experiences . but that is a Tru@@ g@@ ator .
these are two different things - two different kinds of sens@@ ations in order to be accurate , different ways of life .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and don &apos;t mean for my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
sorry that I will be here personally as personally but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago .
and I am not sad to all that - I know that I am now myself .
local groups war@@ n prior to an increase of self @-@ mur@@ ders within the nation@@ alities of the Arab Ah@@ aw@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iran@@ ian Ah@@ wa@@ z region is suffering from an un@@ usually high unemployment - and dis@@ courage within the local Arab population .
since the past months there has been a strong increase of self @-@ mor@@ nings .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man called J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August the des@@ per@@ ate situation of Arab Ah@@ aw@@ az@@ i community in Iran is characterised by poverty and unemployment .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he dwelt in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the south @-@ west of Iran@@ ian .
he l@@ itt among anxiety , depression , and he sh@@ am@@ eful to come up for his own aid , to come up for his own help , so u@@ w@@ az@@ i rights groups , who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
a on YouTube shared video took the moments when he was reli@@ eved himself .
some people managed to clear the fl@@ ames again , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought into the Tal@@ eg@@ han@@ i hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
local sources such , the bur@@ ns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only su@@ icide that appeared in August within the Arab Ah@@ aw@@ az@@ i minority , and activ@@ ists on the spot that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ aw@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights announces that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ ate , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sh@@ ah@@ ab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - on this month .
their stories have a thing together : there were all family members , who fled because of the persecution by the Iran@@ ian government , hel@@ pl@@ ess and un@@ able , their families to nour@@ ish and safe work .
Arab Ah@@ aw@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , where a large majority of those living in Iran in the Arab Ah@@ aw@@ az@@ i community has failed to strike from a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult to dispute their li@@ vel@@ i@@ hood .
in front of a century the arab@@ ic Ah@@ wa@@ z was a pre@@ domin@@ antly autonom@@ ous region in Iran until the P@@ ahl@@ avi mon@@ archy took over power and 1925 great effort to finish ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region there are some of the largest in Iran &apos;s oil and gas areas , as well as some of the most important and most valuable areas for the Iran@@ ian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy develops slowly , and the local population gets only little of this wealth .
it is often victims of un@@ treated disorders , hunger and dism@@ iss@@ al .
the Iran@@ ian regime den@@ ied the Ah@@ aw@@ az@@ i @-@ Arabs systematically established jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government also has a variety of com@@ bs built , the waters of the Arab territories into the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are to guide .
these do@@ bs have led only to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation of devast@@ ation , and local agriculture , as well as the fisher@@ man and pal@@ ms industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ ha@@ w@@ zi yo@@ ung@@ sters rose up to 81 % .
NO@@ UR Mo@@ h@@ amm@@ ed P@@ ur , the Irish Chapter for co@@ oper@@ atives , work and social welfare , mel@@ ted that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who completed a job , the primary school completed , 55 % of a further school and 45 % have a university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance . &quot;
Kar@@ im Doh@@ im@@ i , an Iran@@ ian Ah@@ aw@@ az@@ i human rights activ@@ ist that the present situation , a mixture of poverty , unemployment and r@@ acial ethical discrimination , &quot; to a &quot; high increase in the number of self @-@ mor@@ dial among the young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i men .
Doh@@ im@@ i said that especially the unemployment has become worse than this is a combination of a high number of in Ah@@ wa@@ z and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the action process :
since functional and institutions are not prefer@@ able to the Arab labor , the local Arab T@@ w@@ az@@ i is moving access to work opportunities in all sectors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force her li@@ vel@@ i@@ hood outside their home Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are people who had to hide their 1st and sur@@ name to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ aw@@ az@@ i to hide and so , since even Arab names do not toler@@ ated , because the Sp@@ eak of the Arab language or t@@ ear Arabian clothing .
given the given circumstances , which must bear the Arab Ah@@ aw@@ az@@ i , will strike the human rights activ@@ ists before the situation explo@@ sive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is up @-@ to @-@ eight and it is taking note of it .
the main reason for self @-@ ord is un@@ treated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and su@@ icide is avo@@ idable .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I am not identi@@ fying with the femin@@ ism , also with the inter@@ sec@@ tional not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
details of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Commons license .
the following article is an updated version of the statement made by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . the article was an object of several discussions in which many different positions came to expression .
you can read in the comments under the original text .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I say that I am not femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women , which call themselves as an ins@@ ecti@@ tional Fem@@ in@@ ers - with fr@@ ust . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you wonder@@ ing why I am not part of the movement .
they even put a good dr@@ astic scientific and social arguments against me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally be all femin@@ ist * in general .
for example , women nowadays , despite equal education still earn less money than men .
that women still stand under strict observation when it comes to what they are doing with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women &apos;s sooner or later in various areas of life to a glorious cover , and that discrimination are moving due to the many different countries and beliefs .
all of this is aware and well @-@ known .
I am convinced that I will be able to double and thre@@ e@@ fold .
I am a black woman .
and yet : if I have to speak on skin colour , on black CIS @-@ women , on black or women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; when I consider to suffer , on which type we are physically , se@@ el@@ isch and ver@@ bal abuse have been physically , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , cle@@ ave many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , however , all those interested in that women - all women should come together in order to lift &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their voices and th@@ umb@@ aya , &quot; to sing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to sing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to sing the equality ( some ) of women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but they do not want to talk that there are in addition to sexu@@ alised violence a institutional form of a @-@ realistic force , which we are exposed to black women on two @-@ fold manner .
or above that black women and women of other eth@@ ines and cor@@ com@@ ings are less deserve than white men and women .
that black girls and girls are referred to with a migration background of the school as a white girl , due to obvious integration issues .
or that women in black spher@@ es and women with mig@@ rant background are exposed to a higher risk to suffer from domestic violence and violence in the partnership as a white women .
on the one hand , I want to do that all men , all men and all human beings have any skin @-@ color that have the same rights ; on the other hand , I can not join me as black woman in whose centre the white woman stands out to consider the inj@@ usti@@ ce , inj@@ usti@@ ce in their mind that relate to both the gender and to the skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and I am no longer strug@@ gling to fight my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented spec@@ imen , which me and countless other black women are always rejected and repeatedly rejected .
So@@ jour@@ ner be@@ compl@@ ained 18@@ 51 in their speech : &quot; am I &apos;m not a woman ? &quot; and also I appl@@ et me to maintain an ideology in the black and historical way to a human and margin@@ alized being .
I ref@@ used to connect me by group@@ ings who also have absor@@ bed by cultural an@@ ne@@ ign@@ ation of our customs and customs , to advance your eg@@ oc@@ entri@@ c program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will no longer try to present white women the importance of the flo@@ wering of skin colour and sex . because some of them continue to remain the significance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to honor them a better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even though the inter@@ c@@ tion@@ aries of femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women of different her@@ es to be at home , and from white femin@@ ism , is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in his name .
I prefer to release me fully from femin@@ ism and to connect the movement of the W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which is called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather than for a white @-@ femin@@ ist parad@@ ig@@ m , that is that inter@@ c@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a new phenomenon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is more important than ever before we define black women according to our own ideas and create us into the spher@@ es which are created by us for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book of Afri@@ cana . ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves in this way , in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , physical , physically and even the spiritual elements can be hon@@ ored to make the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists immediately will call separ@@ atism and exclusion after they have read these lines , please inform yourself about the hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement because of which the black women is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ ist environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures , because in this parad@@ ig@@ m I existing .
I will be recognized due to my dark skin and due to my existence as a woman as part of this parad@@ ig@@ m .
I , a black woman , can flo@@ ur@@ ish in an environment in which my life is neither over@@ looked , nor ignored .
Pad@@ lock against the pollution : the mission of a man to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations

Paragu@@ ay Women and her more difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women poses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The we@@ pt women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain over the women &apos;s mor@@ de in the country and in the region to show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the short@@ ened and processed version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paragu@@ ay &quot; of course . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # soft@@ ening ) that reported on violence against women in Paragu@@ ay .
most names were changed for the protection of the affected people .
a police un@@ com@@ miss@@ ar said Ada B@@ á@@ ez , that they had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , their ex@@ ert@@ ing who has become violent to violence .
since the end of her relationship was some time passed and the police said , her statement would not be put into the printed , but more could not do .
as another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed for Mis@@ sh@@ and@@ lung , useful display of Ada B@@ á@@ ez is nothing .
a few days later the second woman moved their display .
the Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ reis of violence against women is difficult .
if women have no indication at all at all , they do not receive any support from the state .
in many cases women also depend on the men dependent on men that mis@@ sh@@ ells . this explains why only 20 % of all women who ad@@ mit to be victims of violence at all at the criminal prosec@@ ution authorities .
content 1 Tem@@ ge and Statisti@@ ken@@ 2 Inv@@ isible Mis@@ sh@@ and@@ ments and a legal system , the nothing contrac@@ imm@@ t@@ 3 Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , lack of stro@@ kes and statistics
it &apos;s hard to determine how many women really mis@@ ts , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researchers on the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a social research institution in Paragu@@ ay . &quot; there are different information and reports that are not even ans@@ ing the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paragu@@ ay . &quot;
but the figures are however al@@ arm@@ ing .
in 2015 , we went to the District Apostle 9@@ 600 ads due to domestic violence . at 70 % it went to violence against women .
86 % of ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads due to domestic violence in the peace of peace . also here 86 % of the ads of women .
in the ads , 40 % of women , that they were physically completed , 55 % of women spoke of psych@@ ic mis@@ conception .
but these statistics do not indicate the true scale of violence against women in Paragu@@ ay .
according to the information of the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ic women of the Federal Minister of Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of those criminal off@@ ences are actually shown . &quot; on each woman who will be re@@ funded in Paragu@@ ay because of psych@@ ic mis@@ conception , 9 women who do not do this .
on every woman , which are rei@@ mb@@ urs@@ ed because of physical missions , two women who do not do , &quot; stated them at the end of 2014 .
since femin@@ ist in Paragu@@ ay is no own criminal off@@ ence , cannot be appropri@@ ately documented how many women are ass@@ inated each year from their current or former partners .
only until August 2016 , journalists at least 12 cases of women &apos;s icide in the country alone .
the coordin@@ ator of human rights in Paragu@@ ay is documented at least 37 cases in which women were mur@@ dered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates in Paragu@@ ay all ten days a woman due to violence did through men .

invisible mis@@ eries and a legal system that takes nothing
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he was on that she called for him the name of all their former friends .
at the beginning she did not want this , but then however , too . this should not regret it forever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos . but two years ago she b@@ ore the psychological force of violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe forms of violence against women and at the same time .
I never had thought that I would ever be victims of failure .
if I have previously read about it , I always thought that the only women had happened that the only women are dec@@ ei@@ ved because they are dec@@ ei@@ ved by violent men .
I was convinced that I would never pass this to me .
Mari@@ ana uses social media to report about the Mis@@ sh@@ and@@ ation by Carlos Vera .
without name , they wrote posts on Facebook , in which they describe his ins@@ ults and different attacks during their two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated them isolated .
many people answered their contributions , including Carlos even . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ally , whether he had ever raised the hand to them , and ref@@ ug@@ ly that his behaviour was also a form of failure .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why they had liked the so long run by Carlos and did not left him before .
it seemed almost as they wanted to say that victims of mis@@ eries have at least a certain compassion on it .
Victoria San@@ tos , which dates not from Paragu@@ ay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paragu@@ ay to prove that their former partner she was mis@@ conception .
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te CRE@@ O ( &quot; I think you &quot; ) , which consists of women all in any way victims of failure .
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : you take the statements of women seriously .
in Victori@@ as case , everything started with psych@@ ic mis@@ conception .
your we@@ al@@ thy partner creates it finally to persu@@ ade them that she was worth@@ less .
then he started to beat them .
Victori@@ as View on the authorities remained without a result and also of their relatives , she received no support .
she led to a process against their former partners who developed into a und@@ eni@@ able legal struggle between Paragu@@ ay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and influence of their former partner .
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , lack of implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paragu@@ ay there are many laws which are very good but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad of failure is a path full of resist@@ ors and a fight against corruption in the judiciary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Gen@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paragu@@ ay , also sees great problems when applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a proposal was discussed at the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ El@@ las ( # Für@@ st ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ ir@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non One @-@ Less ) are part of a campaign on Twitter , which is supported by Am@@ nest@@ y International .
the original design of the law looks before , femin@@ inity to explain to a independent criminal off@@ ence to explain and t@@ oug@@ her as it is already in the neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
thus , the legislative text in some points altered to win the MEPs for the law , the fear@@ ed that the way for the de@@ cri@@ min@@ alisation of waste , which currently be b@@ anned in Paragu@@ ay and can be pun@@ ished with up to five years imprison@@ ment .
the original law@@ yer had intended to carry out the majority of the ( bureaucr@@ atic and economic ) which must bear the victims of violence today , if they simply draw up only display and wish to receive a secure accommodation , to leave the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law cannot be effective if the legisl@@ ator does not have sufficient funds to make it available :
in Paragu@@ ay is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here must have a re@@ think that violence is no longer considered to be somewhat bigger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those given this facts silent , makes himself guil@@ ty of debt and contributes to that the perpet@@ rat@@ ors of stra@@ ins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must report as long ad until Mis@@ sh@@ and@@ ing is no longer considered normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Sen@@ at . previously , parts of the law was changed . thereby , among other things , a passage in cases of domestic violence was called for re@@ conciliation .
the opinions about changes go apart .
the section on re@@ conciliation was seen as an opportunity for ag@@ gres@@ sor , his victims was again att@@ acking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fil@@ ing of words &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; political force &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; political force &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in parts of the law does not apply as a great return . &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent media in O@@ man passed a year after the ban on a newspaper attack
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked due to a resolution of the information package &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is being locked on the homepage of Forbidden Newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one year ago , the om@@ ic authorities have closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of its reporting about corruption in the Sult@@ ant .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison , where he is one of the years imprison@@ ment .
two other editors from Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and countless al Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and placed before the court , but later came back again .
O@@ man has been ruled by Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us Ib@@ n S@@ aid , who came to power since he had his father , S@@ aid Ib@@ n T@@ aim@@ ur , through a state of state .
since then , he dres@@ sed , next to his role as a single Sult@@ an , the most important branches in the country : Prime Minister , Defence , Minister of Defence , Foreign Minister , Foreign Minister , President of the Supreme Council for planning and President of the Central Bank .
the rule of sult@@ ans is marked by the persist@@ ent efforts of the security of security , the public freedoms , including press freedom , limit@@ ing and human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blog@@ gers and other activ@@ ists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities limit peaceful and leg@@ i@@ time activities in human rights systematically and hin@@ der citizens , also activ@@ ists , on their views on public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , their closure , and the envel@@ oping three of their editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , founded in which founded in 2007 about corruption in O@@ man ( an absolute mon@@ archy ) until it was b@@ anned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Ch@@ ef@@ red@@ an editor of Az@@ am@@ ari , was published an article with the title &quot; high @-@ ranking parties of the judiciary . in it , it was about corruption in the Judi@@ ciary , and interference of high @-@ level leaders in legal decisions .
in the report , government hon@@ ored , judges of the princes of Jud@@ gment in O@@ man under pressure , to raise an judgment in one inheritance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n from 26 July 2016 with a report on the title page with the head@@ line : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ level parties &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , it was pay@@ able by Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a member of the F@@ TT committee , which was charged with the ISS Department and on his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 the ISS Dep@@ uty chief @-@ editor You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j was firm , who had acts after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper was closed at in@@ definite period after the information offic@@ in@@ ini@@ ster was given that &quot; the publication and spread of the newspaper on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , took place in front of the court in Mas@@ ur the first ad@@ here in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i .
the Court condem@@ ned the three journalists to prison and sho@@ cked the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condem@@ ned among other things due to disorder of public order , &quot; abuse of the internet &quot; and &quot; Sub@@ ec@@ ular of the pres@@ tige of the state . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j has also been found in the violation of an audience and the emp@@ t@@ ance for guil@@ ty .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were condem@@ ned to three @-@ year @-@ year @-@ year and money sets up in height of each 3000 om@@ ic Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . furthermore , a single year @-@ year y@@ ver@@ bot were condem@@ ned against the two journalists .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was condem@@ ned to a year in prison and a pur@@ pos@@ ited in the amount of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after spending the use of an information on the spread of material that could pose a threat to the public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a deposit was arrested in the amount of 5000 om@@ ic Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) and he was released on 22 August 2016 before the jud@@ gement from the harbor .
the Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al said Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 free , condem@@ ned al @-@ Ha@@ j is one year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months prison .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after the ren@@ unci@@ ation of his six@@ ty @-@ sentence in Mas@@ c@@ ade . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he was acc@@ ented its one @-@ year imprison@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al also raised the decision of the information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the decision of Jud@@ gment , Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper is exposed to attack by the om@@ ic government .
on 8 January , the information sent to the information sent a statement showing the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the information offic@@ in@@ ini@@ ster personally signed a further directive in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with the ministers introduced a further time against the decision of the Court of Ap@@ pro@@ positions , the publication of the newspaper again .
the permanent closure of Az@@ am@@ n and attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only ones in which in O@@ man has been in@@ ju@@ red in recent time the press freedom has been in@@ ju@@ red .
for example , for example , the closing of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ at@@ ine and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online @-@ Newspaper of the country .
due to the permanent closure of the Az@@ am@@ n and the intimacy of the journalists Al @-@ Ha@@ j arises the impression that the om@@ ic authorities are still not ready to prepare the extensive violation of the press in an end .
the Golf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ ic authorities to :
1 . You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally release ;
2 . a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n to create their journalists of their work ;
3 . protect press freedom in the country and
4 . under all circumstances ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in O@@ man can exercise their right human rights work , and without fear of au@@ tions , including judi@@ cial Shi@@ eld .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understanding
Ran@@ j@@ it W@@ arri@@ er 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with your consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media . it is an increasing range that addresses an urgent needs of the continent .
for the demand on site medical research there are two reasons : for a lack of global health care for many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need for the African continent .
disease such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and mal@@ aria have in the poorest countries of Africa far gra@@ zing effects than elsewhere , and lack of investment in the expl@@ oration of these diseases are a major problem .
secondly , research which is conducted by African scientists themselves , in setting up your own research area in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it W@@ arri@@ er is director of central banks in the center for the research of inf@@ ectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
he grew up in Lus@@ aka @-@ years in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS @-@ epide@@ mic effect on national health showed .
he left Sam@@ bia for a study in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indiana .
as Post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself on HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the green health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. W@@ arri@@ er discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understanding the media about this research .
( disclaimer : Dr. W@@ arri@@ er speaks as an individual ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( A@@ GM ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it W@@ arri@@ er RW : at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results . in doing so , I support the sam@@ pled national programme for anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy ( ART ) with Lab@@ ort@@ ests .
besides , I just got a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant pa@@ tho@@ gens .
A@@ GM : what are your opinion about the important current academic topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
D@@ RW : there is no basic research in the field of research . we only put solutions to which , which have been developed elsewhere .
this must change , otherwise we will always be recipi@@ ents to be instead of ourselves .
the solutions we get , are often used in our environment and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
A@@ GM : where does the financing and support arrive ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult it is to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are very well funded .
it is difficult to find people who come back or go here because the financing and development of development are better in other countries .
A@@ GM : how is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are you in your routine research work which you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money , continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratories is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
A@@ GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that cri@@ tic thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
A@@ GM : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa which should focus on and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age .
the social sciences , computer science , big data , expl@@ oration of the space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ agi@@ ous diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it .
A@@ GM : can you describe us the pro@@ s and cons of life as scientists in Africa towards Western countries , based on your experience ?
D@@ RW : many times are there the limited speed , things to do , and the per@@ tise access to scientific expertise , which are challenges here .
the system that Journals is available only against payment ( the so called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , is limited to the amount of availability information and speed of research .
from the USA to India : how to change open source &quot; world producers in food production
this article by Rach@@ el C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website of En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reported on solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on grow already since the 1980s in the USA .
its company offers 114 sorts , such as out@@ red@@ ded , the first plant , which was grown by NA@@ SA @-@ A@@ stron@@ aut in space @-@ space and ench@@ anted .
nearly 20 years of long life Mort@@ ons has been only through his own ingen@@ u@@ ity and the question as many sal@@ at@@ sor@@ rows he can get borders .
but the beginning of the 2000@@ s he not@@ te that more and more sal@@ ads were pat@@ ented , and that he could not keep it further on the bree@@ ze .
the patents g@@ old not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a specific rot@@ ors or green leaf .
over the past few years , more and more of such patents have been registered with regard to more plants such as grain or card locations . due to this trend ensure plant bre@@ eder , environ@@ ment@@ alists and defects must ensure food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia native tradition , Mort@@ on and still salad , it needs to be however longer because his work is always worth more than ever .
&quot; it is , when would lie in a river a rock rock that I have to p@@ ump@@ ed down .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we need to do that now , but it is a break with the sugar @-@ tradition , &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that patents go to Sal@@ ads too far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stand before the judgment , no one can grow any more a new sal@@ at@@ sor@@ te because all features already pat@@ ented . &quot; he is so good as possible and tried to grow those characteristics that he wants .
however , it is very careful and stri@@ ves to use no material to be protected as a spiritual property .
he also joined a movement which is getting bigger in the US and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; open source &quot; ) .
A@@ stron@@ aut of the International F@@ gym ISS CONT@@ IN@@ K the red Rö@@ mers@@ al@@ at of the Sor@@ te out@@ red@@ ded in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station and ate . there is tested whether plants in the space can be grown .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no co@@ incidence that this name rather sounds like it would origin@@ ate from the IT area and not in the area of plant breeding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; -@@ seed ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copyright @-@ protected software .
it was declared to live in order to ensure that some plant types and inf@@ uses are not protected as intellectual property and are permanently usable for plant bre@@ eder .
as part of the initiative , in the context of the initiative , in Os@@ si , you can commit US @-@ bre@@ eder that others can use the seed rep@@ lied with seeds .
this does not imp@@ ly that it does not continue to do business with their seeds . &quot; open source &quot; -@@ bre@@ eder do not allow others who bought their seeds , to grow so own varieties , and it is not immediately expressed - two aspects that are b@@ anned by many plant pat@@ ente .
do@@ z@@ ens bre@@ eder and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its start in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
for the em@@ eri@@ te Professor of the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Ma@@ dison and Os@@ si leader member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control over the seed , and the ability to grow new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection .
seeds , therefore plays a role in larger associations , such as biodiversity , control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bree@@ ders would try to use the latter not or just little by making seeds with natural resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stres@@ ses that the &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movement is not busy with gene@@ tically modified plants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all kinds of plants could be pat@@ ented whether vegetables , cor@@ n@@ ological , gene@@ tically modified or not , from ecological agriculture , or not . &quot; to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , as he is offered in August or September 2016 , such as it is offered on farmers market , should also know that the way is b@@ red as this vegetable is threatened , threatened .
nutritional sovereignty without the seed of seeds is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative commit themselves to provide others with their seed to be freely available . there@@ with , its action is contrary to pat@@ enting , seed , and plant to pat@@ ented .

Os@@ si @-@ suppor@@ ters ar@@ gu@@ ed that the future of the food supply remains at risk , since the available Gen@@ Pool is always available due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights in the plant material that is thus always enabled , un@@ abl@@ ish@@ able .
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive name of the Os@@ si , has been engaged in their doctor@@ al work with gene@@ tic variation at car@@ r@@ ots and their availability . it found out that about a third of all boxes are protected as intellectual property , making it usable for plant bre@@ eder either at all or only .
for other plants there is still no estimates , but experts like Lu@@ by ver@@ mu@@ es that mass@@ aging plants like wheat in the greatest style pat@@ ented are pat@@ ented as a salad or car@@ r@@ ots .
a question of point of view
plants are so bre@@ ed that they deliber@@ ately wanted characteristics - from such that their taste or her color improves up to such because due to those they are flo@@ ur@@ ish and threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eder is currently taking up more patents . gene@@ tic diversity are currently necessary than ever before as the changed conditions are much worse than the changing conditions are much worse .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ Spre@@ cher@@ in Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ uto , that gene@@ tic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four gen@@ ces and cooperation with institutions such as the agricultural creation of the United States , the company is committed to maintaining the gene@@ tic diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , however , the view is that intellectual property other bree@@ ders as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and the protection of plant tun@@ nels innovation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is essentially a plan that everyone can follow once the patent is ex@@ pi@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to get the same procedure with another method .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such protection does not inhi@@ bit@@ ing innovations rather than it promotes the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mort@@ on sees the other : 20 years to wait , until a patent , is certainly not innovations .
and if you are so long waiting for them to be waiting in plants , which are adjusted to the changed environmental conditions , we have lost the fight already .
the main leader for Mort@@ on is , however , that gene@@ tic resources have always been a general practi@@ se and they should continue to stay : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eder have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ ary incentives are not attractive for us .
we want farmers to make their work easier .
that is what we d@@ speakers , and it is impossible to make us impossible , if we do not continue to use the best and latest gene@@ tic resources . &quot;
overall , Mort@@ on on the concept of itself , plant suff@@ ice to pat@@ ented : &quot; we are creating the characteristics not really themselves .
the plants form them themselves and as bre@@ eder we finally have no idea how the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Car@@ ol Dep@@ pe , the plant breeding , in the U.S. state Oregon and Os@@ si leader member , there is still another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who ch@@ ick@@ ed a s@@ ail , even bre@@ ed its own values in them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who believes in industrial agriculture with large cour@@ ty@@ ards and mon@@ oc@@ ultur@@ al believes in their cultivation of her@@ b@@ de her@@ d , the b@@ lows in its varieties of agriculture into it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that are to move on international markets , but smaller than e.g. mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , make it possible to survive most smaller seeds , even without patents - either reject the pat@@ ch@@ ement , or they keep it out for too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case .
the independent to@@ ys Frank Mort@@ on is looking for in his jurisdiction garden Sal@@ ads .

Mort@@ on is also the view that bree@@ ders made by the A@@ her@@ ent of plant pat@@ enting of innovative products : &quot; it looks like I can produce with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that pat@@ ented .
I need constantly new material for my catalogue , since I know that my competi@@ tor will sell my varieties in a few years themselves , he says . &quot; with a patent you are being protected from competition , what makes it in my opinion very nicely easy . &quot; worldwide res@@ onate .
although the US appear to be a leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding leader , but in the meantime , but it is rapidly spread throughout the world .
in India the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) that proves itself as a professional organisation in the area of resources , an &quot; open source &quot; seed , &quot; is working together with farmers and helps them to grow new varieties that meet certain requirements .
it also supports them to come to &quot; open source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
the German organization Agre@@ e works at an &quot; open source &quot; license which ultimately is a form@@ ally and legally binding form of the Os@@ si @-@ obligation for bree@@ ders in the European Union .
( rules for breeding differ from country to country , presence because of the Os@@ si @-@ obligation will not simply be transferred to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive powers of the European Union , the European Commission , explained that conserv@@ ative plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . so that she speaks against the current practice of the European Pat@@ ent@@ am@@ ts , the patents on con@@ ven@@ tion@@ ist plants allowed .
however , a declaration is not yet a law ; now it is to the governments of the Member States , to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , Dutch organization will host a conference to &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seed banks and the seed companies from across East Africa to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; world movement and worldwide trend towards the pat@@ enting of seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ vos &apos; program for &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ seed systems that the organization currently holds a worldwide alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ seed systems , for the plan@@ etary next year of the official start to fall .
a combination of environmental protection and development of sub @-@ groups ( including Hi@@ vos , the international non@@ profit @-@ development , technology and concentration - Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database to seeds and biodiversity together to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map to publish .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of the food - a trade and aid of aid organizations such as W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report that farmers have to get involved in seeds , to exchange and improve the seed policy to ensure a stable supply of food .
in the report also emphasises the importance of a variety , local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems , a connection from the Lu@@ by Os@@ si hopes that him will soon realize him more people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has grown mainly on where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , so Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to keep people clear that even more behind their foods are &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organization and blog are the latest goals of the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
still un@@ lock the Egyptian authorities content on the Internet .
this time the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ nis@@ ts .
on the weekend of 05.@@ August , the Egyptian government the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documents human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world .
August , the network published a statement on Facebook , in which there is the Egyptian authorities for this step cris@@ y and said to continue working and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information Management - despite this attack and the constitution of the Egyptian law and the Constitution shall continue to uph@@ old these goals , so it was never so difficult as now . AN@@ H@@ RI , so it was never so challenging as now . AN@@ H@@ RI , so it was never so difficult to overcome these goals and not to ad@@ mit . we ins@@ ist on it to continue our task further .
AN@@ H@@ RI is regarded as the first c@@ ens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt following the authorities for more than two months of 21 websites , like b@@ sp@@ un @-@ speaking issue of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , and that from Qatar @-@ speaking network of Al Ja@@ ze@@ era for the provision of terrorism &quot; support for terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organization of the wave of web pages for victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language htt@@ ps : / t@@ .c@@ o / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
besides AN@@ H@@ RI , there is also no access to the blog of the Kolum@@ ni@@ sten and Human Rights in Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada , no access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the distribution of Colombia and articles , which he has not write for in Egypt and writes media sites .
now the blog , which he set in to handle the vill@@ ous government to deal with the Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack .
Blog@@ ger , the provider with the also Zi@@ adas blog heated , but on the other hand it is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journ@@ alist , spent nearly 500 days in cap@@ tivity , after having been arrested in December 2013 by Egyptian vulner@@ abilities , and recorded a video as the police heard of physical violence against two students .
his article focuses primarily on politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada on the blo@@ cking of the government and reflected what this means for him :
the , blogs to sper@@ ren is very old , but also in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi top priority ; and even if the block@@ age of the blog might not be meaning@@ ful for the world , so it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) It has succeeded to convey to the feeling of a board , a trying , a attemp@@ ted murder , ent@@ b at the National Security Council , the block@@ age blogs as well as any other web page , for which I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I wrote not otherwise . in other words , my words have influence , even if only on a small audience .
I want to mention that this blog was a archive for me .
first , I used it to the post of articles to deal with the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
now however after they have blocked it and that they may have fear of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the cour@@ ageous go the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ey and Ex@@ pression ( AF@@ TE ) sp@@ err@@ ed Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 . August 133 websites . this energetic technical tests in the networks of different Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) , e.g. orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE is also documented the block@@ age of vend@@ ors , through the conver@@ ging of internet @-@ sur and private surfing , so called Virtual Private Net@@ works ( V@@ PN@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in its research :
on Monday , June 12th we were not@@ able to offer like the block@@ age of web pages , which began V@@ PN@@ s .
this kind of practice indicates the intention of the government to block further contents and filter , to which the Egyptian users may have access .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation is additionally wor@@ sen that the ens@@ hip &apos;s decisions will be made behind for@@ ged doors , giving the Egyptian population no legal basis , using which they can advance the court against these actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the question is : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and whom will it be next to the next attack ?
is Rio de Jan@@ eiro at war ?
the inhabitants are riding .

day of day we report newspapers across Brazil with arm@@ aments head@@ lines from Rio de Jan@@ eiro , the second largest city of the country and home of numerous Post@@ card motiv@@ ated .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second day will be a police offic@@ ers in Rio de Jan@@ eiro , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Di@@ ebe rob@@ ber@@ y pharmacy with military weapons from &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; president Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Marine and Lu@@ eb@@ ee to Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the violence of violence reached the highest level since 10 years .
the Brazilian @-@ government organization Global Justice , even called the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
reports like these are everyday and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the manager of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so published for the detailed reporting of violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 16 August the editorial article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which it announced a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the moti@@ ves for their decision explained the newspaper so :
extra will continue to report on crimes that are happening in every major city on the world like murder , smoke , etc . all what happens from civili@@ zed standard and what is happening only in Rio , is released in the section &quot; War in Rio &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative to allow us as a journ@@ alist not our eyes before the cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video that was divided on Facebook , explained by Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor of the newspaper that this decision is not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war@@ ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that cannot det@@ ects the war .
in the same video a journ@@ alist of the newspaper , that it is controlled by the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Jan@@ eiro 843 areas which are controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial article the newspaper writes :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that a war will be dis@@ appoint@@ ing when he is dist@@ orted , also used , atro@@ cities the police , which has only sho@@ cked and then ask questions to for@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Maf@@ ia and its partners .
Sch@@ a@@ det the name of &quot; war &quot; more than they are useful ?
in an article on the messages portal The Inter@@ cept Brasil argum@@ ented the journ@@ alist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira against the violence as &apos; war . this is their opinion on the justi@@ fication of the failed security policy .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and bad planning - how Extra is shown in the analysis of the military deployment in Rio themselves - in combination with complete investment in personnel , education and historical and self @-@ suffici@@ ency of the public service .
to remember : the Federal State of Rio de Jan@@ eiro is greater than its capital .

none of these cities is in the Federal State of Rio de Jan@@ eiro .
if we look at the M@@ ord@@ rates per federal state , is Rio on position 16 , &quot; writes them .

to these safe @-@ policy action also belong@@ ed to the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ d@@ ade de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the federal state of Rio in the year 2003 presented a Fav@@ ela to con@@ quer and one unit permanently there .
at the beginning of this fact , this was actually resulted in a dis@@ infection of violent deaths . for some years the U@@ PP should protect against ch@@ ic@@ ism and repres@@ sions against poor municipalities that should protect the newly created police unit , increasingly under descriptions .
on his Facebook page , the journ@@ alist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux from one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio do not meet the - by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
besides legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as war also sever@@ ely serious consequences for the people to themselves .
for this is calling the state on , means and ways to use the typical for a war . this belongs the penetration in the territory of a &quot; enemy &quot; , with which a civil war is an un@@ sharp point in the countryside and to the object for &quot; coll@@ ater@@ al damage &quot; and &quot; ver@@ ir@@ r@@ te balls . &quot;

the Ski@@ p to the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French Refl@@ ection agency A@@ FP :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we chose for the cultivation of mushrooms , because they have a high value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and wa@@ it@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ah@@ med L@@ eil@@ a , one of the organiz@@ ers , reported Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years ago , this project is known to be well @-@ making and oppressed his relief that it will now win more and more &quot; to famili@@ arity . &quot;

Dr. L@@ eil@@ a said Global Vo@@ ices that it began with the &quot; production of &quot; production from the regions around the pilgri@@ ms &quot; before they are their quality , and whether they are suitable for consumption .
then they planted a small mush@@ room in a tub . as this yellow , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; teacher &quot; &quot; &quot; teacher for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the goal of the protests of the Saturday was the call for better form@@ alities and fire measures taken by the state .
people asked about why the civilian protection was not able to cast the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
Jo@@ ão So@@ ver@@ al by the Cov@@ en@@ ant of the farmers from Portugal to the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
according to Pedr@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , streets and villages for everything and nothing ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated .
this Sunday they did this nowhere , there are do@@ z@@ ens reports of open streets that were closed from fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria would have been able to pass a similar tragedy as in June , as the streets were very late . &quot;
furthermore , buil@@ ders are asked in Ö@@ r@@ t@@ ories with high fire risks .
a far ri@@ pe proposal to the Wal@@ dre@@ form , which had brought the government after the he@@ ighten@@ ing fir@@ es in 2003 and 2005 , was manif@@ ested by the commun@@ es that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .

these problems come out that the website of civil protection from Portugal on 15th and 16th of October , as local citizens would be used or tried to contact persons , offline .
it was a private initiative that reconc@@ iled the population with information : she uses its own civilian data , using the application fo@@ g@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of the walls .

in one night in the autumn of 1994 the Con@@ quest of Af@@ gh@@ ans started by the Taliban .
two years ago was a terri@@ fic civil war between the different Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ ed@@ in group@@ ings that had defe@@ ated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . so Afghanistan has become a country of terror and des@@ pair .
exactly at this time sat Ash@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , which belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Af@@ gh@@ an , for the last time with his family at dinner together .
even if his mother was not so said so she knew that she would not see her son very long - maybe even more .
in the morning light the boy should break .
his un@@ cle would bring him up and bring it to the g@@ ep@@ ers .

Ab@@ dul Ali Ma@@ z@@ ari , the leader of the Haz@@ ara dom@@ inated Party He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ W@@ ah@@ er was just been mur@@ dered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara was suddenly apparent .
the Taliban known for their hat@@ red on the Haz@@ ara known Taliban were always closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the land towards Pakistan or Iran .
some days after their flight , A@@ co@@ af found himself in Pakistan again .
a couple of years he worked in a co@@ her@@ leg@@ ory . the work was hard and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his low pay , and went in Iran . once again , he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and sl@@ w sacks , which were heavy as he himself , in order to earn his li@@ vel@@ i@@ hood .
back then as today the life of Afghanistan was influenced by El@@ end and exploitation .
&quot; it was really tough , &quot; remem@@ bered the shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ( Af@@ gh@@ an refugees ) lived in a le@@ erst@@ on building on the job@@ site , on which we also worked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were no services there and no heating . we susp@@ ended n@@ ylon in front of the open windows so that we do not fail . &quot;
after four years the shar@@ k leaves his life without papers in Iran behind and made them ready for the trip to Europe .
in the dangerous over@@ ride on the sea , he made a wre@@ ck and stran@@ ts on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected its asylum seek@@ ers , A@@ shar@@ af 2002 came to Italy .
some time was A@@ che@@ af hom@@ eless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church which twice a day to aid food .
it is true that Italy is due to relatively high authori@@ zation quot@@ as is a kind of second chance for ex@@ pi@@ an asylum seek@@ er . it is true but also that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Human Rights of Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; suffer from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers will be accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; special event centres . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be assigned an application for asylum seek@@ ers , if they have officially submitted an application on Asy@@ l@@ um - what can be moved after the registration of the asylum seek@@ er .
until then people are people who have no money on accommodation , either rely on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the road .
so erg@@ ing it also al@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ interrupted life @-@ w@@ ille has been able to free from these conditions soon .
after having done several years in construction different work in construction , w@@ att@@ ed the whole savings into the establishment of a youth hostels in Venice .
this was so good that he eventually opened a second hostel after a while .
&quot; shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now the topic of the documentation &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of director A@@ min Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film received 2017 the Venice City Award , which was launched in 2017 already for the 24th time .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to in@@ official estimates are about 20,000 Af@@ gh@@ ans in Italy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many of them the country is a transi@@ tions solution on the way to other European countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years some of Af@@ gh@@ ans @-@ driven companies , including cut@@ ters , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Af@@ gh@@ an restaurants were even pra@@ ised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ m@@ adi the idea to his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ it@@ ers and the kitchen largely made refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant is told by the various char@@ ity , Ira@@ qi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their trip to Italy .
the Af@@ gh@@ an entrepreneurs Ali K@@ han Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizzeria Cab@@ ul@@ og@@ na in Bologna and a Sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Af@@ gh@@ ans .
however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims to reach far beyond the Italian dining area and the retail outlets and aim back to the country that he had to leave as teen@@ agers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where a risk is , also possibilities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ co@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I never forget my country and I cannot live happy when I know that my people suffer .
I plan a project for farmers in the poorest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they present the half of the society and have to get the same ways as any other . &quot;
&quot; shar@@ af lubric@@ ate plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where the people can learn at the packaging and account techniques . &quot; so they can improve their har@@ ps on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development to successful entrepreneurs was a journey through uncertainty and doubts , but at the end stand stability and prosperity .
A@@ che@@ af has made this journey itself . now he also wants to help other Af@@ gh@@ ans on this path .

global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ ural report is an international sn@@ apshot of the challenges , vic@@ t@@ ories and forth@@ coming trends in worldwide internet rights
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Egyptian Parliament checks a law@@ less@@ ness , which fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration in a government body . &quot; &quot; &quot;
users would have to be able to use social networks within six months after the un@@ successful law@@ yer on the website of the authority under specification of their full name as well as its Ausweis@@ number .
who sh@@ out@@ lined this step up to six months to be judged for up to six months or the ends of a criminal off@@ ense .
the law , which was funded by six@@ ty parliament@@ arians , is currently the legislative and the constitu@@ tive committee of the Parliament and should be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; May has filed an other member of the legislative acts , in which t@@ oug@@ her pen@@ alties for the ins@@ ult of the President or a high officials would be introduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
under Egyptian law , the ins@@ cription of the president as well as government institutions are already stra@@ ined , but under the law pre@@ cip@@ itation would have a kind of fact , however with prison and money , such as right @-@ wing of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
should the law adopted , this can mean up to three years in cu@@ sto@@ dy for the condem@@ ned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , this would be a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and failure to freedom has been in danger for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a distinctive example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ id ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) which were arrested on 13 August 2013 , whereas violence against prot@@ esters are demonstrated against the military put@@ sch , who had led against the elected president of Mo@@ h@@ amm@@ ed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan wa@@ ited , such as more than 700 prot@@ est@@ ators that were arrested in the same inci@@ dent , four years in cu@@ sto@@ dy on a Court of Recom@@ mend .
recently , his article was post@@ pon@@ ed on the 20th of May , because the prison condu@@ ction according to human rights groups remin@@ ded the def@@ endants of the prison in the court .
Sha@@ w@@ kan dro@@ ves the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups are in@@ sist@@ ent , hy@@ po@@ ised burden of e.g. weapons , illegal assembly , murder and experim@@ ent murder .
in another case , a criminal court in Gi@@ za the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ o Al @-@ Barb@@ ary is free . they were indic@@ ted for their reporting to pro @-@ Mor@@ si Seat block at the Rab@@ a &apos; a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in C@@ airo .
the Court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Ab@@ dul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ st@@ af@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , which were also arrested in the case of the aforementioned inci@@ dent , from 25 years to 5 years .

the document published on 21 April on the website of N@@ aw@@ at published document , th@@ rows a light on how the pre@@ domin@@ als plans to support the legislative action .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia lean the den@@ c@@ ination of his sources under specification of article 11 of the Tun@@ isian press release , which journalists have the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless he joined the District Court in Tunis on 09 . may as a witness in the case .
will China the users of social media like to set its reference ?
according to new regulations of the Information Office of the Public Republic of China , the users of social media need to write social media in China before they write messages in social media .
in the regulations is also stated that registration will be required with the full potential name .
analy@@ sts agree that this can be achieved through the elimination of anonymous comments in the social networks . it is up to now un@@ clear how the authorities apply to these rules .
Chinese net citizens proposed in social media , these provisions will only sel@@ ective sel@@ ective to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence .
