<seg id="1">Although I had attended the USA since 2012 at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is tremendous.</seg>
<seg id="4">As many of my generation I grew up with American films, American authors have read and operated his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this land had a very profound impact on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year I played the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray grandes in The Pelican letter, a furious replicted conspiracy of an oil-Magnum, which were the top of the conspirited with judges who were interested.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free to Method Man, "me was's as if the absolute truth is, Vergiss everything else, that's what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the US had even more amplified.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "I always said," America is the only country in which I ever lived, whose diversity is so welcoming, that you are always the one who you are and it's easy to find acceptance in an community of like-minded people. "" "</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very tragic love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then came Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he goes with his Engdies.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops with his opinion on the mountain how to say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He tells exactly what he thinks, such as a former colleague, and explains its contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afrosive and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless people react to his statements and voted in favor of him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes that he won in the replicating presidential elections, the highest number that was one of the Party nominations ever reached.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigotte person, I asked me?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not ump his voters in line with people who had met me during my time during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example, Prof. Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of the journalism program, which takes people from all over the world, a deep believer man, with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also unanimous trumps do not look with the by Peter Bhatia, the current publisher of the "Cincinnati Inquirer" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I had met us with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the "Phoenix."</seg>
<seg id="25">Trackintolerance is also in contrast to the generosity that I lived with Sandy bahr which in fighting their lives the environment and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">Yet it fits to the commitment of Kristi Kappes that always with much patience and grace to me and my colleagues helped to get used to the complexity of the American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Bisey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors who helped me much for my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and they embodied by them deeply deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump his way to the nominees republiican Presidency, she grips me a halt and the nace for its limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016 gave over 50 million Americans, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of its contempt towards non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The examination of the idea that people for Trump have been voted because they were either interracial or fanaticism or because they were prepared to overlook these things, broke me almost the heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Maybe it is unfair the trump voters as a coassiest to call.</seg>
<seg id="34">To put people on one of my friends, is exactly what has led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful and indicates a imability to understand those who act on another way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not considered.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters have tuned by which most knows are, for Trump, because they would like to regain control over a country that she has disappointed?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might want to say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commented the cruel decision to raise a man who look down with contempt to those who look differently from it.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this" "" "Whitelash" "" "(e.g." "" "reelongation of the White against all other Ethics," wordplay from black into alline to the White and whiplash, which means as much as sleudertrauma), as it was the great Van Jones praying, exactly the killed that America has made so great. "" "</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American Ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - what faith or background one can always have, America is called every welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this land chose as his president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose story, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the choice Donald Trumps there is a huge part of the white Americas of this promise and says: to hell, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 is the white man on the ruin, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all this I have to think about Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who liked in Iraq, and what he said in the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">In a manifestation for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of man with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" said Mr. Khan.</seg>

<seg id="52">"have Latinos a place in your America?"</seg>

<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and lautate "no."</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan completed with the words: "God is thanks to Mr. Trump, that is not your America." 36 hours later he was reported.</seg>
<seg id="59">The country, for which his son was, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trackland, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could not find a place in this new America.</seg>

<seg id="78">The young bandmembers take their obligations to the music group very seriously, means the local press noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">Once they come from the school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they carry out their big passion to deal with their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They are always laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the Trubel you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, clarinet, oboe, flute, Waldhorn, Pauke, Bongos and the Conga to play.</seg>

<seg id="86">In an article from Los Angeles Times Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, at the first time:</seg>
<seg id="87">First, it was very difficult because we had no room to rehearsals and we worked at the same place where the parents worked in the trash. children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact their parents because many of them do not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something that he never had seen before: one from waste and violin.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra, playing on instruments of reproduced material and that is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>

<seg id="348">On a shield the Japanese word has been met (korean sha), the "older autochdrivers" means, "mistakenly - maybe even with bösable backgrounded & # 8212; as" furthinkable drivers. "</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was on electronic display in the input area and to read the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">Editing the original fotos of Joshua Levine, which was often shared in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The error was the translator Holmes, a local residents of Kyotos that dropped. it was also that the locomotives made it attentive.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Daily newspaper Kyoto Shimbun wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come up with such an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">This is an insult to older people and in an international city such as Kyoto simply unacceptable, "said Holmes.</seg>
<seg id="356">The faulty English translation was first removed. the name "Hdrivers" (German: "furnable drivers") was later replaced by the appropriate, if also grammatically not quite correct name "Elder drivers" (German: "older motorcyclists").</seg>
<seg id="357">The police of the prefecture Kyoto apologies for the translation errors. furthermore, they explained that the error was already contained in the text that they had been checked by the translator and that the translation has not been checked for their correctness before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows on the sorry:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we are sorry that older people through the inadequate correction (the translation) in our turn," said the police. "" "</seg>

<seg id="361">"" "" "" "the word" "" "furnerston" "" "was indicted as an adequate description of the motorcyclists. according to the police there are the share older drivers who are nationally involved in accidents, but quite an occasion to worry." ""</seg>
<seg id="362">In the prefecture Kyoto for example were caused by a total of 19.460 incases of Seniors. this corresponds to a share of 10%.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, caused by seniors 1.803 of a total of 11,850 accidents.</seg>
<seg id="364">In this way, its share rose to 17,7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">While the number of accidents involving a total amount is declined, the proportion of seniors are caused in the same period.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To translation you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the starting text and active language skills to transfer it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires an active mastery of the target language - something that is in the case with mother tongue. in general the conviction that translators is not in the target language - not in the initial consultation - motherlanguage should be.</seg>
<seg id="379">This should be a French mother tongue, for example from English to the French language - not from the French.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr-users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese businesses do not employ people with English as motherlanguage, translation into English. this may be attributed to faulty understanding of the translation, cost reasons or the relatively low number of English speakers, who will learn the japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies who have even no foreign employees release, however, the Japanese employee does not make their English knowledge as the best added to translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr-users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation are also widespread - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The worrens and mysterious sets that arise by machine translation, that this technique may not replace long human translators. this applies to some languages very special.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the rare English formulations in Japan, including those of the selections, which are often T-shirts or pockets, are only used for stylish reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr-user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable as jewelry nor acceptable or at least harmless. but by major companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">The city Kyoto uses a reputable source for their translation.</seg>

<seg id="423">The shop is quite simple: a large family with little money surrounds their minderold son or her mold daughter to another, richest family. in exchange the child gets a job, a training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">But what is not mentioned above, is that the children must make countless days of homeswork, which will never be paid and victims of abuse and miseries; and all this within the frame of a contract cannot be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="425">This as Criadazgo praxis is common in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organizations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After completion of her studies Alvarenga couple of years for an organization that fighting for the rights of the boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">In doing so she spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Criadazgo - sampled stuff and prightened.</seg>
<seg id="428">You tried to name things in the name, because the feeling of gratitude that is the criadic as a spirit, guaranteed in general still silent.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>

<seg id="452">They want to be that Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo for the murder of the girl who was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment.</seg>

<seg id="458">But they all went on to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as Criadita in the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of their employers Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day.</seg>
<seg id="461">At the same time, they had to share the time so that you still have time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">It was standing every morning at five o'clock and prepared the breakfast for their employers before.</seg>
<seg id="463">Free-day for example, they purified the fridge, pens the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the ground.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was at the end, she went back home and had time to learn.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, documented the progress made for the north of Japan on the permanent daily Kahoku Shimpo, the progress made in the last six years to be affected by the "Triply catastrophe, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had triggered the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung established its headquarters in Sendai, which lies in the prefecture of Miyagi. the prefecture of Miyagi was a certain prefecture of Japan in Japan, which both experience the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring prefectures Fukushima and Iwate were catacuated, because the tsunami had disappear whole coastal cities.</seg>
<seg id="547">Even more, the prefecture of Fukushima, atomic accident, already alone had to leave their houses for 160 000 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows the progress of six years after that, in order to rebuild the lives of the local.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper involves both statistics of the Japanese reconstructions and survey results of the affected themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing facility in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung reports that until December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement parts (I, saigai kouei juutaku) in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate finished.</seg>
<seg id="552">The biggest success among the three prefectures could draw Miyagi, here, 80 percent of the planned replacement parts were finished.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses have finished Fukushima with 70 percent the final light.</seg>
<seg id="554">However, one strives to still, even six years after the catastrophe, evacuation of Beheled accommodation ("" "" Cloacetsu juutaku) in the final replacement parts. "" "</seg>
<seg id="555">After the three-fold catastrophe almost 80 000 people were forced to live in fortune accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 there are still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such things.</seg>
<seg id="557">Nearly 40 percent of the year 2011 evacuitates from Fukushima live still in emergency accommodation, while Miyagi are more successful. more than 75 percent of evacuacuated, which were built after disaster in Behaviation accommodation, were converted into the final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the number is here at 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected positions</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo-Newspaper could have been affected by 1100 schools, which were affected by the unhappiness until December 2016, which makes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures are far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 percent of fishermen harbors in Iwate and Miyagi are now back into operation, have recorded at Fukushima 30 percent of fishermen and operation.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the atomic accident, have moved into the three prefectures of the land of agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi could recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas, whereby only 66 percent of the Ackerland in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed Ackerland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">"" "it is unlikely, that is only a consequence of the nuclear weapon, because only 690 acres of 5 400 hectares of destroyed by Fukushima, are located in the" nuklearthly zone "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has far back completely recovered again, but also here Fukushima far dropped.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are back to 90 percent at the same level as before the unhappiness. Fukushima on the contrary, there can only be 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo-newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the territorial inhabitants, it would be more difficult to earn their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">To determine a picture-up, the paper conducted numerous surveys conducted by the local population and among the evacued by the evacued. she asked her about the state of the rebuilding and also how you can find their sensation in the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction to the article the Kahoku Shimpo-Newspaper:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo led a survey by more about the tsunami awareness among the local people in experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey brought that 83.1 percent of the local residents, measures have to be taken to be prepared for future earthquake and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of the surveys that has still not been done enough in disasters prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it is about those who had to evacuated from prefecture of Fukushima evacuations</seg>
<seg id="576">In its edition to the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung has strengthened its attention to the situation of the evacuitates from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to experience not just the enormous earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima was also witness of the worst, disastrophenols, atomic injuries that had to experience Japan ever.</seg>
<seg id="578">From 160 000 evacued from Fukushima were overlaid out almost 63 000 people in areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 there were some more than 23 000 people who have been back to Fukushima, in permanent spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the stand of 2017 still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the Katastrophenols, most of the evacuants have to withdraw over 50 years of age, older than 50 years old. they have to compete with massive construction projects because the efforts for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima with massive construction projects are to compete with massive construction projects, which are part of the Olympic Games, which will take place in Tokyo.</seg>

<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of sugar-tube industry was a economic necessity: the 155 sugars brands were technically simplified, and hardly competitive they were unsupported for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to focus production on the most efficient production, the annual production objective was 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories, the sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euros).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar farms and the sugar rise on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar rate increased from around a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025 must remain the price of unrefined sugar between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 report on the agricultural perspectives of the OECD and FAO, the agricultural and food organisation of the United Nations.</seg>

<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos where young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the U.S. federal state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'yoo tells the story of the highway 16, also called "highway of the Highway 16, also" highway of the tears ", in which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered.</seg>

<seg id="779">I have now know illness and sensational journalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come over every day to newsletters over and see the titles with pictures which actually originate from a textbook for crimination or from those from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I have the feeling as if I am the lonely, which is attracted or sad. it works as a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be effective or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">You writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it is not normal that my 10-year Cousin thinks that he is plco (German: drug) will, if he is great. and it is also not normal that people listen to the "Heldentate" of offences if they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is, as would they share the ones who have lost someone and those who have fear that they also have happened.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories are going to be mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The Tatenlessness of humans is unbelievable for me, if the death of six people and the fwinders were justified by 43 students in a neighbourhood that they were. "</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to talk so that they have spared from such a tragedies when they are not rusty and still are.</seg>

<seg id="797">We want to be arrested by the others, as they do not know when they turn you or kill them.</seg>

<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the endangering town of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them.</seg>

<seg id="805">But they are irrelevant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, told him that his mother disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But that was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>

<seg id="809">As Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez was seen as follows:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 as violence through organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most vulnerable city in the world due to the number of moratorium on the border of public security and the government of the United States Government.</seg>

<seg id="908">Saudi-Arabia, 2012 / 2014.</seg>
<seg id="909">This reorganisation of state was mistakenly that the president of Myanmar Than His 2012 have been catacated that monks and politicians who have been involved in the pans of Rohingya Muslims and brought the story to the picture of Sange.</seg>
<seg id="910">The article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the image is still included in it.</seg>
<seg id="911">Spain, 2015 / 2016.</seg>
<seg id="912">This article was published by 2014 about Students, published by the Boko Haram, published by the Aneolian near Análisis Digital, has expressly declares that the image is not originated by the testimonials, but it claims that it is a "similar dschihadistic attack."</seg>
<seg id="913">As the picture later in connection with the massacre of the Boko Haram, took place in circulation, tried the newspaper El Pais to oppose that there would be connections to Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="914">Turkey, 2015. "# NijeryaYanıyorslyaUyuy" (Nigeria, the world sleeps).</seg>
<seg id="915">The picture of the DR Congo, provided with this Twitterhashtag, and solvent a discussion among Muslims after the massacre of Boko Haram 2015 and the connection to Charlie Hebdo in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="916">They wanted to achieve that their communities were happening to this events, which took place in the name of Islam, a greater attention.</seg>
<seg id="917">USA, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The image was discussed as a letter for the massacre of Boko Haram 2015 tagged (and more than 9.300 Male retweetet). but the messages that were linked to that were in no religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead it was the goal, attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media reporting in comparison between Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Hebdo.</seg>
<seg id="920">Vietnam (Maltese), 2014.</seg>

<seg id="922">From the message, in which the picture of the DRC was included, the organisation of the Claretine Missionaries and Pater Juan Carlos Martos.</seg>
<seg id="923">There are other confirmed examples of an incorrect use of the image from Sweden, Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="924">On other accounts, aggregators and sites in the following countries (at the cap in grey) shows ink also, but are no longer fully retrospreadable: Czech Republic, Australia, Peru, Peru, Netherlands, Sri Lanka, Azerbaijan, Japan and possibly China.</seg>
<seg id="925">(data inspecimens with URLs and time / data stamp exist on the web crawler and forging them through image file associated with Nigeria or Rohingya Muslims.)</seg>
<seg id="926">In all these cases, which appeared only significantly after the original unbice of 2010, the image will ultimately be a correct description, but the originals is not available or accessible.</seg>
<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (inhibitions) that this Posts prevail. the first frame focused on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the murder of Christians by Muslims or - for the defence of Muslims and the murder of the Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how a African life is evaluated compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion do not want to understand and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worthwhile to examine how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question is however what happens if readers can no longer believe these pictures.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media there are great people who have unattended the unattended part, the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggrert these mood of the misery and counterfeit that actual atrocities are untrue and narroasted it the actual Greys of what actually happened in the DR Congo, in Nigeria and in Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The dissemination of violent images was already discussed in detail (here for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">An argument is that the withhold of images of a wading same, the tragedy can recognize that the tragedy are even demanded by the victims itself.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern that nonviolent paintings and audience is desensitise and to empathy the ability to empathy empathy (such as this study, which have been subjection to how violent media seem to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss the slower intestines in the news media, is fact that they are indispensable for today's message-reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologist experiment, because with algorithms to support the fight against "Fake News." you will have to be thorough about the situation in which a picture may be heard, which actually can be dissolved by the context or disabusive manner.</seg>
<seg id="940">A any investigation of false grants should be taken into account as internationally as internationally.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name of Untranslatable (e.g. Dt. untranslated) strives to make voice-inspired a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not at all to translate.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words are available in every language: they press certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these untranslated words are already well known today (like the famous Portuguese wardade) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish sobremesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resistors are insistent to each attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">One word or expression is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes some context are required to understand exactly what with this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words were collected already for a whole time in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists treat Japanese, French, French, Portuguese, or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of "Untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you will find an example of words from the VAT language of Vanuatu as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"" "" "" "vakasteglok" "" "- Bemüh you have striving for your parents in recognition of how to have taken care of you in your younger years." ""</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunswick language that are spoken in parts of Brazil as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The convenience or laziness, which one feels after one has begun on the old days in the sun.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds her own words from his blog About:</seg>
<seg id="956">You wear other cultures, softened other thought-sounds and arouse our re-earth.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this page, you want to post more of this "untranslatable" words and show how different, valuable and impressive these small languages are.</seg>

<seg id="1199">What have we posted in this process of timeless convictions?</seg>

<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bastion cultural prototypes is provided as the work that he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 in order to reconstructed the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the iminary of numerous civilizations and here merging Greek architecture types with hiesy traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel could not know that ten years after having started working with this work, the IS would raise all this, that's not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens, but the world embodied out.</seg>

<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I nenne his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought me English to me even when he was located in Haft.</seg>

<seg id="1255">Mosambikaner reagates with wrath on a corrupt stand, in which a registering, after half of his sentence returned to the workplace in the state apparatus, at which the corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">It is here: Diodino Cambaza, in 2008 and was arrested along with four other defendants of 54 million Metikal (around 800 000 Euro) for 22 years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money stained from public funds from Mosambique, whose Council Cambaza between 2005 and 2008 board.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of a good guidance and immediately requested his repetitions in the company, which took place on 19 April.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with an opinion of the prosecutor Office of the Republic, the request was made, there would be no obstacles to Cambaza, back to its old post, as the company is full of disciplinaration after his harbor.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many people do not have the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, shortly CIP), a local institution that advocates for public transparency, condemned in an interview with the Deutsche Welle decision making the decision again:</seg>
<seg id="1262">Represents a proposal in the fight against corruption and indicates the lack of transparency and is even a step forward with regard to the efforts of our legal system, so the CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we take note is that the company should also have a disciplinary proceedings against the resistance.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the firm allow apparently to illustrate a reasonable legal steps to apply the appropriate functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Egídio VAZ, a significant voice in the mosambivalent social media, rejects this behavior also and considers the case as "" "" conflication "" "": "" "</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza a competent type would be, he would be consultant when he was sentenced to a imprisonment and the half had dinner.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could hold numerous lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and put his image gloss.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has maintained to be integrated into the company that he has helped to add damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Consequently, it is obvious: Cambaza will be happy to be paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Resistably!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambicanarian and student of Political Science in Brazil says, the director of David had no Moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza from the state recognizes, because he won him wound I cannot believe anybody in such a way that the state has already received so massive.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing the morals to return and serve the state, * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead it serves only by the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as a handshal money source and the state itself is tired too, the preloaded and finally condemned to a long imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Frankly, I do not know why this man was rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeúte preferred to remind the Prime Minister of Mosambique, Samora Machel to remember that a thief belongs to the prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Diters belong to prison Samora Machel will not only remember the Mosambition and not only as a first independent president, but also as a sharp, impeer and - next door is said - prophetic editors.</seg>

<seg id="1281">In Twitter the responses were also ablishable:</seg>

<seg id="1287">The burmesan word "Kalar Pae" means kipeel or spammbse.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to information from Facebook users in Myanmar, the famous Social Network took their emts from the net because they liked the word 'kalani'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Though about the origin of the word still is debated, it is usually used to refer to people as indicative origin or generally used as an adjective.</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook censert the word "calar" or stickers "(in Burmical font) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of the Assyria in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years the rise of radial nationalist movements gave the word an extremely valuable connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by Ultra-nationalists as a speech against Muslims, a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight a speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of senseless content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself is not calling in isolation.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that even Posts in which they discussed the use of the word or have doubts about the purpose of his hand, censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Moreover there are several burmesan words with the different meanings that have the same letter as' kalani '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair on Burmese also 'kalani htaing' written what the same letter contains, as well as other words such as' kalar Pae '(Ahrbse),' kalani oat '(Kamel) or' calmaar '(curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebookuser Aung Kaung Myat stated the different meanings of words with the sound of "kalani ':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends has been deleted today because he was contained the word of kalani.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However he asked his friends on a spiritual nature, whether they might spake as he could spake his back pain, as he made a text game.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The sentence ku la - "healing" (ku) + the Beageword (la) to Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were several reactions to the initiative from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Ham is the opinion that she is to reduce hassing nationalists, but also, that facial may be analytic, before it proceeds all Posts to spread racism in suspected racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It is filtered the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatic dism is not understood what you write on facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should be instead, the post is carefully to analyze and control it by using the adjacent words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar Pae" (Muerbsen).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good is that this dreamy nationalists, disseminate a pretty good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcision their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action likes to send a strong signal to all the hassing language may not keep the efficiency of this strategy for long time.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experience of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and Wechat have proven that the census of stroke often is a catchy and mouse game, whereby the users can start social networks simply to use a new word or alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author of Kaung Kaung Myat described, as Facebook, began to delete his post, when he wanted his friends to inform his friends, that the word 'calar' is conbanned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was attentive to this new Directive on Facebook, I made a post to share my Facebook-friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironisses was removed my mail from Facebook and told me the lips, post and sharing of content for 24 hours because the post office is not corresponded. "</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of trombone of people who have no negative intentions or simply try to show their opinions against the Hasstalking radicalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without Hassino from Facebook away.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post-part of the author his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have been done before the beginning of the initiative, for example the Burmesan Internet community to ask for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma by its platform but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words must be ensored only even more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">In addition, it appears as if she started without local context or technical support, and so words like "chair" or "builsencurry" have been banned.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they did not have any mistakes, they don't want to reinvigate the precipitation of it.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had only have more respect for the 15 million benefits that will take them a great turnover, it would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has taken care of a lot of spott among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users are now aware of Facebook funny and be aware of the word 'kalani' not in the context of Hasslanguages to see whether their emts are taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook-Posts that were no hassing language, but nevertheless they were removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The burmesan's text is "I want to sit on a chair and at the Pale curry and watch an Indian movie.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Only to try whether Facebook removed the post, which contains the word kalani. "</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot, with permission used.</seg>
<seg id="1334">"" "the post" "" "if you are a doctor, heal you then people?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, with permission used.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Over the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks to broaden their voices and their influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, Hassination in social networks enter the violence in the churches in Myanmar in addition to serene, especially in the Rakemine, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced to escape.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been for his failure to bring about charious hassists on his burmesan pages under control, criticized.</seg>
<seg id="1339">However, instead of simply the word 'calar' to censored, it would have better running, rather on context as on the code most concentrated initiatives, and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1352">This kind religious opposition hold tensions in this actually uncomplicated matter, and at some point a doubt whether the opposition would have to agree with the legislative design at all.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017, the lawlessness was decided against the child-woe - despite 4 Senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent who could think that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives where already an easy majority would make him to the law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the President of the country must agree to the law and proclaim the law.</seg>

<seg id="1360">It has too much time and unnecessary smede, which has wasted the core of the matter but know it what? the child-woe is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and this is almost every cost.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The English-speaking Wikipedia-page was presented on 18 January 2012, opposing to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright laws in the US, internationally distributed.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">Since over a month Turkey has now spotted the popular and the crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day for day will be more evident as important the platform for users is to find helpful and share reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students as well as Reporter and fans of TV series to block the blockage.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many engineer-versed internet use it used to use envelop tools for block websites (an up-to-date articles from the New York Times on that Turkey has the third-biggest VPN prevalence of the world), the most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has recently opened article from Wikipedia, as recently published in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University has been adopted, regular blockages of the internet since 2007, after the Internet Act (No. 5651).</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the only known country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform continues to be blocked, are now several Mirrorpages (pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution managed by IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), as the platform all Turkish Wikipedia-pages on its decentralised Peer-to-Peer-network (i.e. computer machine connections), which does not base itself on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is despite legislative ban but disable.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a Blogpost, IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we have heard the news (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we put everything in mind, snapshots from Wikipedia on the IPFS platform. thus, the ability to read the content on decentralized and disshared ways.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to see at least all Wikipedia content, even if they can not reach the website www.wikipedia.org itself.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS was also done that this step was done independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is just about screenshots and not any dynamic or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to deal with the lockout.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consoli from Wikimedia Italy has both trumvikiansiklopedi.org, an open-source project that everyone can use to finish similar MirrorPages, when in the respective country is Wikipedia blocked.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consoli reported subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices and employees at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">There is no complete copy of a proxy address, one Mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">One accesses to another URL that is not the original one. that which one can see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially the server guides the request to the right Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself, if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is carried out by a server, which is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1423">I live on the edge of the Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage, a world natural heritage. what could there be better for a ardent wildlife!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I rested at home for me just like me (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had received a call from my father that on the banks of the Rapti river a leopard would be.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>

<seg id="1427">My father had brought him and showed me the place on the other side, where the leopard was there and I immediately began to cracks pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar seeks co-operation with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nepalants and wants to deepen the understanding of it that wild animals are not so scary as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, for he got tigers already from face to face:</seg>

<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, placed Sagar the logo "I click for Conservation" (lit.: I clicked for environmental protection) in his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However his passion for the promotion of Nepals nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited 22 days long, and mainly lived in a tent to make up at the Bardia National Park recordings of Ottern. up to 12 days, until he was photographed to a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds, who live near the tourist accommodations.</seg>

<seg id="1470">A updated version was published here as part of a content sharing Convention.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women prevented with the greatest care, the names of their wives or even of older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a Pronomen or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women to respect the husband's social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences they should receive the standard abused, this practice on life.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year Malati Mahatoto was condemned by the Indian state Odisha by a bowel and passed away by her family and the village of the community after they had raised a asped relative with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition has also not called their wives, also under the name, is also common under males. however, they have far less legitimacy to fear, if all, they should not come into practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, occurred nine women, including health care staff as well as housewives, a unique club and became quick to the main topic of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place for them alone where they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs, which is in 13 Indian states, it is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and advocates the reduction of Patriarchate Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pawas working for seven years with the help of their videokamera on the uncovering of practices, such as Kinderheirat up to the union of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and guides these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">They reported on how this club made a safe place for these women and made them simultaneously to messengers in the wall.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, the Rohini was shown in their Discussion rounds, handmade of women who don't name their wives.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this issue because they wanted to open the conversation about Patriarchate with a problem with which women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"" "" "" "the name of her husband is not noisy as" "" "it is a breeze which they must maintain all the age of debt and never questioned." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini said:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testified that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not hold, is regarded as deposited as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never made ourselves thought of this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning he wanted to go Rohini, who had never called his spouse so far at home, at home, as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussions with her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband floating long after the video was at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Pracash, my husband, turned to me and said, I solowsing him from now on his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in baggage, Rohini started his first Discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had heard the word "Patriarchate" has never heard before. some believed that it would be a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the videoprojection the women, the discussion with a exercise in motion.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant in the name of her husband with different poems - happy, angry, lovingly, lovingly, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked all, "If we cannot say the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want, means that they do not respect?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"" "" "" "some of these women have been married since 30 years and this was the first day, where she brought the name of her husband to Maharashtra in the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about the break of a long-long tradition, in the married women to speak the name of their wives." ""</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she came up during the whole exercise, a different decided to sled the whole frustration against him and his family by cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ekstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Even in the adrenal ingiveness, having broken up with an urold bread, decided that they actually would try to call their wives to name their wives.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The Ehman of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas put them in the head: his wife could not stop doing his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">A different folding link decided to do it at dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law she stocked, she got fear and said that there was an error.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said: "Rohini said, I solowdo it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant in a group was less understandable and the situation arted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports as women tried to stop other practices, such as the tages of the zinc red point on the forehead, which shows the spouse:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why have only women show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"" "" "" "I said to my husband I would bear the cinder-red point, if he would like it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I heard him to bear him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not completely heard completely with it, but mean, they are now in a better position, even to choose him in some days not to bear.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women the Discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make a trip with every discussion." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Usually we pack lunch and water and go into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "" "" "I don't want to make sure the women make sure what could hear," says it. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1522">In recent months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they dances and spoke about things that they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have been shortened over some things, for example, as our identities to our wife, never so honestly spoken.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to say certain things loud, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we have talk about the concept of honour and how it is connected with clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have been borne by Saris only Saris.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most of this is okay, but some wanted a salta-spa, a vast shirt over a pants, wear; they have not dined.</seg>
<seg id="1529">According to a lot of dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own hanger, the Moral associated with the Saris and a lot more, narrowed Rohini its own couple of Kurtas (upper arms) into a discussion, so that women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they have decided now to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and rohini is certain that they will be able to create it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question whether in the five months since its first discusement club has already changed something, confirms that things slowly come into roles:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only made small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women have tried it a few times, but never heard again to say the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, make it still, but only if they are alone and no other family members are at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two will continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women contribute to their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">Women in the Discussion club know that the changes that they would like to achieve in their lives - like the feiling of more freedom of movement or its own closets - at the end of a difficult to navigible river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By offering each other self-confidence, they shall be aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this clone gives each of us the confidence that will change something.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it will not only be limited to 30 families. there will be a chariretion when any woman goes home and others about what we talk and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1699">But he defends the idea that Singapore is compared with cities like Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently managed by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratically.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants, Europe or Latin America will cross certain places for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula, it is located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by an 59- year-olds, a small woman with a coral-pink brillengestell and gold-coloured earrings in Teddybular shape.</seg>
<seg id="1902">It is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and has grown up there. nevertheless they know many under the name of Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitian, which are on the passage.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has rather no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2,50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms, with Kahlen, crumbled walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In advance there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no Wayshowers to the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Haitian migrants here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez come the people in full small bushes, and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call: "mum Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mum Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet but this year was Ramírez already 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already slept on Kartons.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She does not want to reject any one.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to hospital when they are sick, they purchases them drugs that they cannot pay, they massaged them with a balm that has exhausted from the long trip.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived at a short time.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama was a reasonable name for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The family Sebastiao (with her daughter Merrui, which has a jogchestache) posits with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy bracelet.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," reply he with a smile. "I really feel that it fits, as African women are very nice women.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very lovingly.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the cordiality of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We are very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastianew with his sister, the hopes to get to Boston to reach her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">You already lived in Brazil, however, it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America, then move toward north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard by other departure from Mama Africa. "mum Africa is a well known name on the track," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells us that the shareholder and the Africans often travel together the route and that the Africans were already talking to Whatsapp by Mrs Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">As many of his departure has outgoing on Michelet has lived in Brazil and has worked as a building workers at the building of the Olympic Games and the football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he started his journey into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa: he sold SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the cricket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he is in the future with Mrs Ramírez contact.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mom Africa is our mother and we never let them go again," reply he smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. Ramírez tells you that their guests can send their many times text messages, when they proceed to granting them or to report about their journey over the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith of the drive of their work is.</seg>
<seg id="1934">They do not know a lot about Africa, but their guests have their own, chickens as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well known, but it is not the only spark hope for migrants that travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jesús Valenela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">In this winter, Valenela and his family have taken migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is Polizist and has found that the Bustickets are sold to many African migrants.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He began to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar spent the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment are 25 people there, mainly Haitian.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleeping on blankets on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a kitchenette outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzela explained that he knows what the guests make up.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "I lived in the United States," "" "he told." "" "I experienced what they experience." ""</seg>
<seg id="1944">I have crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others not help. this is the reason why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was transferred to a raid in his work place from the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants that travels through Tapachula, comes from Central America, other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he brave in Honduras with his wife and his three children who wanted to spend the money by him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he was asked for an accommodation and a unknown, a solo-making, has offered him their roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">Some months later the family lives still there and they tried to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the gways sulate the passengers quiet her telephones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A small bus arrived today and has got 20 new guests, a large proportion of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. Ramírez seems happy about that their house is full, but it is also nostalgic, because of those who went away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">As a stolze grandmother blows them in their album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There are one of her daughter with African hairdresser who has made her a customer in, some photos of their grandchildren and many travellers more, young and old ones.</seg>

<seg id="1963">"" "in the release message is said that the app" "" "to get access to terrorist information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because they had installed shortly after they had installed the app, messages exchanged with a private Wechat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the release of the police force, that the app will determine the sources and the distributions of the terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, ebooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">A JingAn website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective cover with a system-categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiuu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the blockers of pornographic websites, by online fraud, Trojan and phishing pages to make users informed about how much time they are online and to control your own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the filters for minors should help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can naturally be used in a wide variety of ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" state actors or even hackers were to manipulate the home network of a person or steal.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is consistent with other measures to take control of the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While reports about digital censorship in China usually concentrate on the experiences of users in the major cities in the East and south, the reality is very often düer for those who live in remote, mutually ethnic minors and Tibetan regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit disrest and dissatisfaction in the conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as an routing Internet circuits.</seg>

<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you will be discovered on an checkpoint with a device without these software, they could be detained up to 10 days.</seg>

<seg id="1986">The provisions in Jingwang may have a reaction to the instructions of the city party, which minimise the spread of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government offices, authorities and the associated institutions including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office during operation of their computer and communication units.</seg>

<seg id="2066">He calls the lovingly "gestant."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It begins with a plastic pipe, which comes probably from the monastery.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your Henker moves to your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2069">Give him the pleasure, you can not measure yourself with him and you can't hold your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2070">My cry were not enough, why they exed the tube by a cable flexited.</seg>
<seg id="2071">In my first release, I asked myself whether the investigator had worked once more as garbage collects or if that was the normal working capacity.</seg>
<seg id="2072">They had four cable pulled to each other to present us from their point of view, great invention of a huge cable.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Within one hour there are rarely three of them while I still have been on the row.</seg>
<seg id="2074">I had any feeling lost in my body - and even my voice, why I stopped to write.</seg>
<seg id="2075">The Henker notte the dropping and found none in it, why he used to become a electrically at a electrically at hand.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Flow through my entire body, enough to store my whole district.</seg>
<seg id="2077">My semi-snack body, the spread over the ground was the perfect conductor.</seg>
<seg id="2078">The numbness disappeared and the pain was back again.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">This must be probably like midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to sleep me again; let's say, that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">Some hours left, who came to me as minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">The door opens and the morning fills the room ".Raus with you, Arschficker."</seg>

<seg id="2090">The jordan Rapper Emsallam Hdaib redet on the rights of LGBT TQ + -community, free expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken from Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends the bulk of his time hiinside, he flattened to his canvas, to his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what can be left, is a cigarette between his fingers or his with nicotine to discover.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives on the top floor of his family house which has been forced to them since 1967; the year, in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family looked into Palestine by their village in Palestine where they had lived as felahyeen (e.g.: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years Hdaib is a passionate activist who presents itself the conservative majority, and their altproven opinions on gender roles, sexuality and free expression by art and rape.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with themes such as Orientalism, racism and the situation Palestinian conflict. all these issues are not only in his hometown Amman relief, but also in cities that weaken from Damascus in Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With its 25 years Hdaib sees itself as someone who is not restricted by borders and he can feel according to their own statement with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries like Iraq, the Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he didn't open it to US foreign policy for US foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib sees his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in the war, anything with his identity as "Palestinian theter of the second generation - so he himself was born himself, even if he was born in Jordan, and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think of my own life conditions so" "" "emphasizes hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think that I am a man, while he remunerated in water, Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; at this time it is for Muslims, from sunrise until sundown.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The jordan law also signifies that the public consumption of food during Ramadan illegal is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a sengaging hot young day little with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the mosquitous coffee and the scales of the Kent-cigarette in the nose is first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially if you throws a look into the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">From therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as to drink in the public during Ramadan of water - to do not land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the German Federal Ministry of Jordan took a appearance of the band Mashrou 'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentarians, who support the Islamic Aktionsfront - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontier Hamed Sinno, the cultural and traditional standards of the country contradicts and the main reason for the concert.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The members and former Presentation of the Islamic coalition DIMA Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert was "especially" because of the sexual orientation of the proposition.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the dedication of the band in matters like the Arab Spring, human rights and free expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which represents the outproven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes throughout the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">"" "in a public statement estimated Mashrou 'Leila the jordan people as" progressive supporter of human rights "one who continues to use" for an intellectual and cultural pluralism. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement is likely to be not easy to seized rhetoric, but in fact a deeper recognition of reality in Jordan, which occurs in Hdaibs works clearly to the occurrence.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016 completed hdaib traditional sexes to be suffering by bringing his vision of the fate of Arab women, predominating sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a clearly lower woman whose arms and legs turn up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red sea; perhaps the blood of the countless women who lost their lives through the hands of those who actually have confidence.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past few years, the number of 'Ehrenmorde' has increased greatly from the official outside of the 'Ehrenmorde'.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Human Rights Watch present the number of honors in 2016 their climax; however still appears that Jordan is missing to have the institutional infrastructure around the women who were victims of murder and domestic violence in appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law of blazing control from 1954, women who are exposed to intra-family violence, "to uncertain time in prison," and for their release is often a prolonged bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee of the family, that the woman will happen nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is known for that, also not before subject to retreat, which in his country long as tabu gold.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib tread that his work was politically, but spatit however, that he cannot part his music, which is full of exponites to sexuality, freedom and expression, not by politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I comm from the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">And I have entered politics, he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">"" "in a song called" "" "Edward Sa'ed" "" "takes the question of the Palestinian identity in the attack." ""</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lavla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb" is the focus on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of the songs that are in the core politically, makes it further.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib released a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is often repeated:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and every other is it too." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a sort of market where you can get in his words, "that is what you want, - be it faith or non-believe, heteroor homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noticed that hardly any anyone in Jordan, talks about the rights of gay and lesbian people and that comments to equality of LGBTQ + -individuals are still very strong in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014 Hdaib an interview conducted for the popular jordan OnlineProgram Roya to remember that his comments from the context was devastated, and his opinion had been censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was not uploaded without a cuts, but he was only a edited version," says he.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today Hdaib open to the arabic LGBT TQ + -community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexuals does not speak to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentioned Abu Nuts, a poet of the eighth century, which is still alive today thanks to its homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks itself: if Abu Nuwhat was to work later on behalf of the Calibrace, in the eighth century, openly about homosexuality could write, why can</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">"" "in the" "" "Fashiemiah's kingdom there is nothing more that the government attacks on freedom of expression and brought that progressive votes to silence." ""</seg>
<seg id="2141">Yet recently, in January 2017, the jordan news service took several former government agencies and members of the teaching federation, with the grounds, they had expressed themselves on comments in social media, that surpassed with the deep in the land of rooted corruption.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of what is the concert of Hdaibs, according to the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to achieve a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him progress is a continuous name and Take. Jordan, Mashrou'Leila now has been honored for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - is made of slow, proclaim and inner changes. he is certain that these changes from day to day in the heart of the Iranian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, but also from an Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He does not only dreamed of it, his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of them to experience them. "</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region is using music, art and literature of real and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, stretching and an artificial nature led. at least howhe that he.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it is far, Hdaib will pass further folders and thus also resigning resistance.</seg>

<seg id="2184">Is it not yet many more important, people who feel broadened, affection.</seg>
<seg id="2185">Exactly this question went out the two young Colombian activists of Leonardo Párraga by the Stiftung BogotArt and Cristian Palacios by the Young-Youth Foundation is no longer out of the head and inspiring it to the campaign Cartas por la Reconciliación (letters to reconciliation), the young people to write too.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only in short was her country-place of a historical event and they wanted to contribute their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had a peace agreement with the Guerillabewend FARC (German: revolutionary forces in Colombia), which forms the longitude of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was considered the signatories of the Peace Treaty, as important that the Colombian President José Manuel Santos for his merits received the peace prize.</seg>
<seg id="2188">"" "" "" "however, in front of the Kolumbians there is a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and of peace." ""</seg>
<seg id="2189">"" "" "" "guerrilla fought for many years in illegal bearings have been exposed to a war rhrhetoric and around the clock, and now have to integrate their weapons upon life as civilians." ""</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian company in turn, who had accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases, she has to record them in their ranks and support them in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombian people would have to connect and help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that is exactly what they did so, until now, thousands of young people wrote poe - love message to former guerillers to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The goal of the campaign are 6900 letters - one for every former guerillers who should be handed over to personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letter reconciliation was founded on the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Conference, which took place in February 2017 in Bogotá. there were Leonardo and Cristian the opportunity to talk briefly to Kailash Satyarthi in February 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">"" "" "" "this said that we love the people that we love, am Valentine's thousands of love, but those who forget that they need much needed." ""</seg>

<seg id="2198">Thus, the plan, letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC to write their place in society and build a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian company is ready to make the discourse of a war history to a common history of peace.</seg>

<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC set itself so on how they had done earlier to take the commands of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no commands, but letters full of undersation of people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings you can walk in just a few hours - from fear through to happiness and everything that is between," told the political scientist Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra parra, a collaborator of the Governors of the province Valle del Cauca describe this unforgettable experience as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After we have handed over the letters, gave me a former fighter through the camp of Guerilla-fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I live in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the Guerillact living) saw I saw a guerillact, who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I had afraid to go down, for next to him on the bed lay a MGL-pomegrowing, a fatal weapon in the village of Dornröschen.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I talked to him, and said," "" "hello, what do they just?" "" "I answered," "" "I entered into a letter that someone has written me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful full letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life someone has written something so beautiful, so I went on to it. "that suddenly took me the tears about the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I sharming him completely and sat down beside the pomegrowing.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was tired of sorry, was sorry, all the years of the faithful companion of this failing to be, and wanted to help him to write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had something else of life than war, was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers in front of famine. "I never thought that anyone would forgive me for my mistake.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is outside a society that is waiting with open arms for us.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I just learned how I have to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">For the prelude of students and some leaders of the FARC come together with a discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown as already war a war and the FARC had already committed in secrecy.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leaders of the FARC the history of the organization, its ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "many years we have experienced how the social injustice on the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can contribute to creating society in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">For a goal of this order, it is worth to overcome all obstacles, "said one of them.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">These people heard who have never heard heard and had no electoral heard, and to recognize that people who often have seen as Monster and even hate, even people who were shot by their living conditions and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality, in which the country lives, does me sicked.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforted me that all men - even those who killed and so much damage to bring us something and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the commandant of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of the City of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The columbians were prophesied that after drafting peace would reign.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as it inequality, hunger and a lack of education, health care and employment possibilities, there will always give people who are willing to access weapons and to protest their rights. and this is also completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We from the FARC now rely on peace, in a policy without arms.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all defenders of peace on - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belonged to rise above all those who dream of a country at war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring victims, because we know from own experience that nothing is simple. those among us who will defend the life as the basis of existence, many difficulties are represented.</seg>

<seg id="2281">This was the beginning of a nighttime.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was attended by neighbors and some remote relative.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The slowed me to return to Chechnya to prove that all that was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They set absurd demands: some said to me, I will show it by the streets over the streets; others wanted that I had changed on the official TV in Grosny and tell me that I was not changed my sex, that everything was only flawful, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have baskets size C - what should I say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older men spoke of my mother in the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">They said to her, "You have brought a monster to the world that not only has your family, but the whole republic is ashamed.</seg>
<seg id="2290">We cannot tell you because you are a fromme woman, but you must disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother was too much and she placed himself a strick around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors come and squeezed them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, under the window a car with abpatient shutters, and a numerical signboard with a 95 drill.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Having happened for the third time I was clear that there was something lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human-legal friends overthrew the numbers - it turned out that I was prosecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you add?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Of security reasons I want to make their name not reasonably, but I will say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help I left the land, but then it did something unbelief.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to get my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without register, without dejovice, without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I break my old SIM card and cast them into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came to and checkout into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">In the moment when I wanted to invoke my mother by Whatsapp, I got a message: "you don't think about, you hest in security, just because you have left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in what Hotel du steckst. you even know your zimmick.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove to you: it is the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my cell number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you still have contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we do not talk about lovemaking strength, however, this is a tabtopic.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditionally cold-Caucasual elements can still be found in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So much I wish to do it, this seelic barrier can I do not overcome.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I say that, as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we mocks with camera, I actually give me trouble like the person who remembered them from their past - so on my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What are your friends who have stayed the location?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I have filed a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For the need I used up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spake with someone that has ended up the loneshalf months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told us that during Ramadan cannot be arrested and filtered, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait until the end of Ramadan, and he closed a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">In this way, my family, they probably invite the relatives, they take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end request a proof that the so called "honour" by blood has experienced.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are now even scoil men in these mysterious results?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a well known by me it would not be very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If then, above all such, who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives were to make Kadyrows court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they will be arrested there so that you can present them later as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: should they be changed, they will show off their body on TV and claim, they would have not been attacked your village or military support.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people have not simply gone, but targeted, in order to radiate themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is now only a mutation or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I have just had someone who was cataped for a half months in Armagazin.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people disappeared in this prison after their beard was grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was since then nothing new of them.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They have simply taken them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And that so called Lord, this person was taken upon himself as these people were withdrawn.</seg>
<seg id="2342">But until now they were not presented as Bandits, there were not yet any reports. we tasted that such actions are not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why nobody would have not allowed these people to shave themselves?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Know if these persecutions and performances of people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation, already in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I carried my hair already long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already known all around Grosny when I still lived there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the sharia was considered, I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "" "" "Russia was originally wanted to lead us to" "" "citizing" "" "but finally gave us back into the Stoneage." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Sharia Law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were exhausted, I had filmed eyelashes, carried the tube jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The safety of the sharia has never met me only one hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian theatre in Grosny was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me met.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole town knew why men knew why men, young people, there met.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been preached.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a reuse: Kharda ma Kharda. this means: "Spotte does not say about the unhappiness of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to children if they make yourself about sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they simply have their eyes up before you, because they believed, you be sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never met me, never ended and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did these mercy seat?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long, to Kadyrov to the Plan appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Minister of Prime Minister, he began to speak on TV over Moral.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He spoke not about us by se, but predominant about the behavior of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel like the people in the city started to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Whoever suffered and had suffered, see you at once with Argile.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the time I left Chechenia.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I was able to feel the situation in the Republic constantly.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go to?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I'd not have a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">That being said, I am still working as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">At the moment I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of Psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teacup, assemble, I share them to hospital and helfe them to get esticcards to them.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I have no cents for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I have discovered these people themselves when I fled from sorte.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: wear a Hiddede?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is alinging.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature is that purely has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">That is exactly the same as Chechnenen, who want to make yourself with foam in front of the mouth, that there are no gay on them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestans have which the Cabardine have which Russians have also what the Russians do they have - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it is to me uncomfortable, sowing.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims, who go into the mosque, and during the Ramadan - live with men together.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Know, many think of Transidentity on men who love men and they believe that you change his sex, to make more intimate experiences. but that is a Trugator.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different kinds of sensations in order to be accurate, different ways of life.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and don't mean for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry that I will be here personally as personally but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad to all that - I know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2481">Most names were changed for the protection of the affected people.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police uncommissar said Ada Báez, that they had nothing against Luis Balbuena, their exerting who has become violent to violence.</seg>

<seg id="2484">As another woman Balbuena showed for Misshandlung, useful display of Ada Báez is nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later the second woman moved their display.</seg>
<seg id="2486">The Teufelskreis of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women have no indication at all at all, they do not receive any support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases women also depend on the men dependent on men that misshells. this explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence at all at the criminal prosecution authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Content 1 Temge and Statistiken2 Invisible Misshandments and a legal system, the nothing contracimmt3 Paraguays laws: good approach, lack of strokes and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It's hard to determine how many women really mists, says Myrian González, researchers on the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a social research institution in Paraguay. "there are different information and reports that are not even ansing the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">But the figures are however alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, we went to the District Apostle 9600 ads due to domestic violence. at 70% it went to violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads due to domestic violence in the peace of peace. also here 86% of the ads of women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads, 40% of women, that they were physically completed, 55% of women spoke of psychic misconception.</seg>
<seg id="2496">But these statistics do not indicate the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the information of the paraguayic women of the Federal Minister of Baiardi, only a few of those criminal offences are actually shown. "on each woman who will be refunded in Paraguay because of psychic misconception, 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">On every woman, which are reimbursed because of physical missions, two women who do not do, "stated them at the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since feminist in Paraguay is no own criminal offence, cannot be appropriately documented how many women are assinated each year from their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">Only until August 2016, journalists at least 12 cases of women's icide in the country alone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator of human rights in Paraguay is documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates in Paraguay all ten days a woman due to violence did through men.</seg>

<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos. but two years ago she bore the psychological force of violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe forms of violence against women and at the same time.</seg>

<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media. it is an increasing range that addresses an urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">For the demand on site medical research there are two reasons: for a lack of global health care for many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need for the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Disease such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have in the poorest countries of Africa far grazing effects than elsewhere, and lack of investment in the exploration of these diseases are a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research which is conducted by African scientists themselves, in setting up your own research area in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is director of central banks in the center for the research of infectious diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in Lusaka-years in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS-epidemic effect on national health showed.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Sambia for a study in the United States, first in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As Postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself on HIV virus, before he decided to go back home to support the green health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstanding the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as an individual).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (AGM): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results. in doing so, I support the sampled national programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with Labortests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Besides, I just got a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">AGM: what are your opinion about the important current academic topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">DRW: there is no basic research in the field of research. we only put solutions to which, which have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This must change, otherwise we will always be recipients to be instead of ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get, are often used in our environment and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">AGM: where does the financing and support arrive?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult it is to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are very well funded.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who come back or go here because the financing and development of development are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">AGM: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">Which obstacles are you in your routine research work which you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money, continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratories is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">AGM: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critic thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">AGM: how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa which should focus on and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special scientific training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The social sciences, computer science, big data, exploration of the space, health care (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="2624">AGM: can you describe us the pros and cons of life as scientists in Africa towards Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">DRW: many times are there the limited speed, things to do, and the pertise access to scientific expertise, which are challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that Journals is available only against payment (the so called "Paywall"), is limited to the amount of availability information and speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how to change open source "world producers in food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website of Ensia.com, a magazine that reported on solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton grow already since the 1980s in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 sorts, such as outredded, the first plant, which was grown by NASA-Astronaut in space-space and enchanted.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Nearly 20 years of long life Mortons has been only through his own ingenuity and the question as many salatsorrows he can get borders.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But the beginning of the 2000s he notte that more and more salads were patented, and that he could not keep it further on the breeze.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents gold not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a specific rotors or green leaf.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more and more of such patents have been registered with regard to more plants such as grain or card locations. due to this trend ensure plant breeder, environmentalists and defects must ensure food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia native tradition, Morton and still salad, it needs to be however longer because his work is always worth more than ever.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it is, when would lie in a river a rock rock that I have to pumped down.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we need to do that now, but it is a break with the sugar-tradition," says it. "" "" I think that patents go to Salads too far. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before the judgment, no one can grow any more a new salatsorte because all features already patented. "he is so good as possible and tried to grow those characteristics that he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and strives to use no material to be protected as a spiritual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined a movement which is getting bigger in the US and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("open source").</seg>

<seg id="2643">"" "" "" "it is no coincidence that this name rather sounds like it would originate from the IT area and not in the area of plant breeding." ""</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative for "Open-Source" -seed) can be inspired by the movement for free "open source" software, which provides alternatives to copyright-protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was declared to live in order to ensure that some plant types and infuses are not protected as intellectual property and are permanently usable for plant breeder.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, in the context of the initiative, in Ossi, you can commit US-breeder that others can use the seed replied with seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not imply that it does not continue to do business with their seeds. "open source" -breeder do not allow others who bought their seeds, to grow so own varieties, and it is not immediately expressed - two aspects that are banned by many plant patente.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens breeder and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emerite Professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi leader member Jack Kloppenburg are control over the seed, and the ability to grow new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds, therefore plays a role in larger associations, such as biodiversity, control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or just little by making seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">"" "" "" "Kloppenburg stresses that the" Open-Source "" "" movement is not busy with genetically modified plants. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented whether vegetables, cornological, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture, or not. "to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, as he is offered in August or September 2016, such as it is offered on farmers market, should also know that the way is bred as this vegetable is threatened, threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Nutritional sovereignty without the seed of seeds is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative commit themselves to provide others with their seed to be freely available. therewith, its action is contrary to patenting, seed, and plant to patented.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi-supporters argued that the future of the food supply remains at risk, since the available GenPool is always available due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights in the plant material that is thus always enabled, unablishable.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive name of the Ossi, has been engaged in their doctoral work with genetic variation at carrots and their availability. it found out that about a third of all boxes are protected as intellectual property, making it usable for plant breeder either at all or only.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants there is still no estimates, but experts like Luby vermues that massaging plants like wheat in the greatest style patented are patented as a salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of point of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are so breed that they deliberately wanted characteristics - from such that their taste or her color improves up to such because due to those they are flourish and threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeder is currently taking up more patents. genetic diversity are currently necessary than ever before as the changed conditions are much worse than the changing conditions are much worse.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto-Sprecherin Carly Scaduto, that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Monsantos activities. with a total of four gences and cooperation with institutions such as the agricultural creation of the United States, the company is committed to maintaining the genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "however, however, the view is that intellectual property other breeders as" "" "patents and the protection of plant tunnels innovation." "" "a patent is essentially a plan that everyone can follow once the patent is expired." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to get the same procedure with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"" "such protection does not inhibiting innovations rather than it promotes the public more material and know-how." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees the other: 20 years to wait, until a patent, is certainly not innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you are so long waiting for them to be waiting in plants, which are adjusted to the changed environmental conditions, we have lost the fight already.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main leader for Morton is, however, that genetic resources have always been a general practise and they should continue to stay: "independent plant breeder have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monary incentives are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">That is what we dspeakers, and it is impossible to make us impossible, if we do not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2672">Overall, Morton on the concept of itself, plant suffice to patented: "we are creating the characteristics not really themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeder we finally have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, the plant breeding, in the U.S. state Oregon and Ossi leader member, there is still another important aspect of plant breeding: "who chicked a sail, even breed its own values in them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">"" "" "" "those who believes in industrial agriculture with large courtyards and monocultural believes in their cultivation of herbde herd, the blows in its varieties of agriculture into it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is exactly" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such that are to move on international markets, but smaller than e.g. monsanto are) patents, make it possible to survive most smaller seeds, even without patents - either reject the patchement, or they keep it out for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent toys Frank Morton is looking for in his jurisdiction garden Salads.</seg>

<seg id="2681">Morton is also the view that breeders made by the Aherent of plant patenting of innovative products: "it looks like I can produce with my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies that patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I need constantly new material for my catalogue, since I know that my competitor will sell my varieties in a few years themselves, he says. "with a patent you are being protected from competition, what makes it in my opinion very nicely easy." worldwide resonate.</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the US appear to be a leader in the "open source" breeding leader, but in the meantime, but it is rapidly spread throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture") that proves itself as a professional organisation in the area of resources, an "open source" seed, "is working together with farmers and helps them to grow new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "open source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organization Agree works at an "open source" license which ultimately is a formally and legally binding form of the Ossi-obligation for breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(rules for breeding differ from country to country, presence because of the Ossi-obligation will not simply be transferred to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive powers of the European Union, the European Commission, explained that conservative plants should not be patentable. so that she speaks against the current practice of the European Patentamts, the patents on conventionist plants allowed.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, a declaration is not yet a law; now it is to the governments of the Member States, to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, Dutch organization will host a conference to "Open Source" -seed systems in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operators of seed banks and the seed companies from across East Africa to learn about the "open source" world movement and worldwide trend towards the patenting of seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' program for "Open Source" -seed systems that the organization currently holds a worldwide alliance for "Open Source" -seed systems, for the planetary next year of the official start to fall.</seg>

<seg id="2721">Still unlock the Egyptian authorities content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a columnists.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of 05.August, the Egyptian government the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights abuses in Egypt and the Arab world.</seg>

<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information Management - despite this attack and the constitution of the Egyptian law and the Constitution shall continue to uphold these goals, so it was never so difficult as now. ANHRI, so it was never so challenging as now. ANHRI, so it was never so difficult to overcome these goals and not to admit. we insist on it to continue our task further.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is regarded as the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt following the authorities for more than two months of 21 websites, like bspun-speaking issue of the Huffington Post, and that from Qatar-speaking network of Al Jazeera for the provision of terrorism "support for terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organization of the wave of web pages for victims. @ anhri one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / t.co / NIZmopDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">Besides ANHRI, there is also no access to the blog of the Kolumnisten and Human Rights in Ahmed Gamal Ziada, no access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the distribution of Colombia and articles, which he has not write for in Egypt and writes media sites.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, which he set in to handle the villous government to deal with the Egyptian government, even the goal of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider with the also Ziadas blog heated, but on the other hand it is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after having been arrested in December 2013 by Egyptian vulnerabilities, and recorded a video as the police heard of physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His article focuses primarily on politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada on the blocking of the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The, blogs to sperren is very old, but also in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi top priority; and even if the blockage of the blog might not be meaningful for the world, so it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has succeeded to convey to the feeling of a board, a trying, a attempted murder, entb at the National Security Council, the blockage blogs as well as any other web page, for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I wrote not otherwise. in other words, my words have influence, even if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I want to mention that this blog was a archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to the post of articles to deal with the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Now however after they have blocked it and that they may have fear of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The courageous go the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of They and Expression (AFTE) sperred Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06. August 133 websites. this energetic technical tests in the networks of different Internet Service Provider (ISP), e.g. orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE is also documented the blockage of vendors, through the converging of internet-sur and private surfing, so called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in its research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12th we were notable to offer like the blockage of web pages, which began VPNs.</seg>
<seg id="2746">This kind of practice indicates the intention of the government to block further contents and filter, to which the Egyptian users may have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "" "" "the situation is additionally worsen that the enship's decisions will be made behind forged doors, giving the Egyptian population no legal basis, using which they can advance the court against these actions." ""</seg>
