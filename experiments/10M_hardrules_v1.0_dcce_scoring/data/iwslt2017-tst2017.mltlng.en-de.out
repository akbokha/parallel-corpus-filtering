this is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won as New York Times @-@ Times @-@ Rep@@ or@@ ter .
long before the one had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , wrote Ris@@ en a book , in which he was spectacular that the NS@@ A illegal tel@@ eph@@ ones of Americans have heard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is another chapter that should leave a constant impression . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this , he describes a dis@@ astro@@ us US @-@ secret operation , in which the CIA is literally given to Iran for a nuclear bom@@ b .
if the crazy sounds , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know , whom the chapter is not covered ?
the US government .
nearly 10 years later the government has been determined by the Ris@@ en and asked him to call its own sources .
in this train he became a symbol for the pattern of the government , whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower to condemn and journalists .
according to first constitutional , the media have the right to publish more secret information .
but it &apos;s impossible to apply this law if media cannot get this information and if they cannot protect their identity .
so when the government at Ris@@ en ank@@ lo@@ p@@ ens , he did something that are many mut@@ ually rep@@ lic@@ ted before him , he ref@@ used , and said that he would prefer to go into prison .
from 2007 to 2015 I lived Ris@@ en with the risk to go into prison .
but then , only days before the process , it was something exceptional .
suddenly , even though they were years for years , that it would be vital for their case , the demands of the government dropped to Ris@@ en .
the reason : in time of electronic monitoring the re@@ por@@ ter and springs can be found more and less .
instead of going to fail and Ris@@ en to make the statements , which could also get his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so , the Medi@@ ator , without his consent , his own phone @-@ wise ,
just as its e @-@ mail @-@ data , financial and bank information , its credit card , and even stim@@ ulating with the list of its flights .
in the midst of these information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Ster@@ ling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lowers and practi@@ tioner .
unfortunately , this is just one of many cases .
President Obama spoke in his approach to protect whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lowers . but instead , the judiciary has more condem@@ ned than all US governments before him .
now you can imagine how one can be one problem , especially because the government is too much from their work as a secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of that a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lowers to a journ@@ alist .
so we put the press release on the game which is to be protected by the first constitutional system , because the government has more and more possibilities to serve everyone .
but just as technology of the government allowed to handle the rights of Rep@@ or@@ ers , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
while you can get it from the moment in which they get in touch , rather than in the post , in the witness .
today , there is communication software that has not yet been written as Ris@@ en his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or telephone call .
such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ drop , an open @-@ source over@@ flow system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lowers , which was originally developed by the internet @-@ famous , which was developed by us and is today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation at which I am working , developed further .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail to send you on a news website , such as the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send informations as in any ordinary contact form .
these will then encryp@@ ted and saved on a server , to which only the respective post@@ al Agency has access .
so , the government cannot conc@@ ede any more information , and many of the information they would demand , would not be published by default .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century . &quot; &quot; &quot;
unfortunately governments all over the world are always new es@@ pion@@ eer technologies that are all endang@@ ered us all over the world .
it is to make sure that not only technologies like Edward Snow@@ den have an option to get mis@@ conception such as Edward Snow@@ den . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lowers .
the information about mis@@ ery in the supply of soldiers is mod@@ est and covered hospitals . or the next Environmental workers , the alarm to for@@ ge water from Fl@@ int pro@@ poses . or a Wall@@ street in@@ sider who war@@ ned us before the next financial crisis .
at all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crimes , but to protect our constitutional rights .
thanks .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 , the largest dis@@ l@@ ery of history has been released . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; &#91; what does this &#93; &#91; enormous money sum@@ men in tax hav@@ ens have been hidden . &#93; &#91; what does it mean ? &#93; &#91; what does it mean ? &#93; &#91; what does it mean ? &#93; &#91; what does this week have been made by news about a le@@ ak of 11 million documents in Panama with law firm of Mos@@ bag Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and Lawyers to firms such as Mos@@ pack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need a anonymous company . you can set it up ? &quot;
we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages how the whole system works , how it works .
this has already led to first very direct consequences .
Islands Prime Minister has come back .
also there is reports that a feder@@ ation of the brut@@ al sy@@ o@@ dic@@ ator of Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad has con@@ cl@@ ed into tax hav@@ ens .
it is as@@ serted that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia president Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend from children &apos;s coll@@ agen , one famous C@@ elli@@ sten .
now there will be out there a lot of rich people and others who are nervous about the next release , and on the next release documents .
now it sounds like the p@@ lot of a p@@ enth@@ r@@ ill@@ ers or a John @-@ Gr@@ ish@@ am @-@ .
it seems to be we@@ pt away from you , ordinary people .
why should we see what ?
but the truth is : if the rich and mighty being able to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens and not all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as healthcare , education , streets .
and this concerns us all .
for my organisation , global W@@ ages , these revel@@ ations are phenomen@@ al .
throughout the world discuss media and leading politicians , such as secret tax hav@@ ens are used to hide their assets and wear -- something that we have been discussed for ten years and un@@ covered .
I think many people appears this whole world very conf@@ using , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax hav@@ ens work .
I always present it like a Mat@@ r@@ yo@@ d@@ rak@@ ed .
so it has a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind those command@@ ment .
it can be very difficult for prosec@@ ution and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really what matters .
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
pres@@ um@@ ably , because there has not been a prominent Americans that came in these revel@@ ations .
well , it is not so that there are no rich Americans to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens .
but by principle , according to these tax hav@@ ens function , Mos@@ pack Fon@@ sec@@ a less American customers .
could we have a data on the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US .
indeed , it is so that you need in some US states less information , less information needs to be found to found a company than to get a sign .
this kind of intr@@ in@@ ence in the US has allowed to zo@@ gen@@ ed from school children to school children .
it has a sc@@ amm@@ ers allowed , especially sus@@ cep@@ tible to des@@ per@@ y .
it is this kind of behavior that affects us all .
here at Global W@@ we wanted to find out how all this in practice looks .
how does it work ?
thus , we sent a ver@@ eign investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 law@@ yers in Manhattan .
our agents announced itself as Afri@@ cans ministers to bring sus@@ pic@@ ious money into the US to buy a house , an yacht , a private jet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sho@@ cked it really that all the proposals made by an attorney . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how he could make his money trans@@ f@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these were all pre@@ disp@@ ense . none of these attor@@ neys took us as a client , and of course nobody was handed over to the money . however , it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as an individual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not about a single attorney , who has sub@@ ordin@@ ates proposals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not about a single peak , re@@ igned in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works , by corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to deal with this , we must change the rules .
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior .
this might sound all very tr@@ end@@ able sound when we could do anything about it ; as if nothing could have changed , as if it is always the rich and mighty .
but as a b@@ out@@ ener Optim@@ ist I see that things began to change .
in the last few years we have seen pr@@ st@@ alls to greater transparency , which concerns the owners of companies .
the topic was found political attention by the British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 Summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
since then , the EU at the central government offices at national level , who really behind companies in Europe are and who are controlled .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is here behind .
representatives of both parties have put a proposal made in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , used as a means of care in the U.S. and global for more transparency .
for us at Global W@@ TH , this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who are angr@@ y when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind sh@@ red@@ ness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need ex@@ ecu@@ tives in the economy , who stand up and say : &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for the business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need leading politicians that recognise the problem and end to it by laws this kind of intr@@ in@@ ence .
together we can end the in@@ transparent , which now enables this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing , finally exit .
this is the story , as I was almost un@@ kid@@ n@@ apped and in the luggage of a red Ma@@ z@@ den would be .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a hinter@@ land .
a guy in the red Chevrolet remained and beh@@ av@@ ed my stuff .
he bought one of my artwork .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip through whole country . afterwards he would go to peace cor@@ ps .
I lu@@ d him on a beer . he told me excited as he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
as we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are you now night ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing even worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what are I now ? &quot;
who knows the situation not ?
do I have to offer a sleeping area now ?
but I just got him today ! he says , he would go to the peace of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he is really plans . I do not want to land in the boot room of a corn !
this is a small cone !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I got a bub@@ ble . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a voice in my head said , &quot; W@@ h , how to please ? &quot;
at night I was in bed , I rig@@ ged to the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what did I get there in it ?
a Wild@@ strange sleeps in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
I got a kind of fear that I went out of the bed to t@@ enth to the door , and completed my bed@@ room@@ mates .
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
the artwork which he bought from me depends today in his class@@ room . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has changed my view of view .
maybe the people who were sold me in childhood as stran@@ gers , actually friends that are just waiting to be discovered ?
people on my air@@ mat@@ rat@@ ze to host , was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco I took the avi@@ mat@@ rat@@ ze .
let &apos;s take a break , two years later ...
I am un@@ employed , almost bank@@ rupt , my room@@ mate moves out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I believe , creativity can create it to be afraid of fun .
I wrote my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I talked to a designer Bed and Bed and Breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk including , a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and set up so @-@ called &quot; air@@ mat@@ rat@@ ze and breakfast &quot; &#91; AI@@ R@@ Bed and Breakfast &quot; &#91; AI@@ R@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ nb &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed with us for 20 dollars on the air@@ mat@@ rat@@ ze on wood flooring .
they found it super , and we also .
I am sure to decor@@ ate our cheese @-@ ham si@@ mel@@ ted completely different because we made it for our guests .
we travel@@ ed with them through the whole city . when we were passed our last guest and the door of the castle fell , star@@ r@@ ts Brian and I attended .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends while we could pay our rent at the same time ?
things came into roles .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Br@@ ads , joined us as developers .
we wanted to find out if you could make a business concept .
so we presented to the investors : &quot; we want to create a website on the people public pictures of their private rooms po@@ sting , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the type of rooms , whose doors are closed when visiting us .
over the Internet , they can then invite people to invite people to sleep at them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we wa@@ ited that the missi@@ le would be .
but indeed they do not .
nobody that is still at Tro@@ st , would invest in a store , the stran@@ gers allowed to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we as children have met all that foreigners are dangerous .
if one has a problem , one can rely on the things that you can get good . we could des@@ per@@ ish .
at the Kunst@@ akademie we had learned that design is much more than just look and h@@ ap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience .
we learned how to design objects however , but now we wanted by design immense confidence , between people who had never before .
can design something like this ?
is it possible to create trust with design confidence ?
I would like to give you a cost , what degree confidence we are cont@@ acted .
it is a 30 @-@ seconds experim@@ ent . it will force you out of your Com@@ fort@@ zone .
th@@ um@@ b high when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like to use your mobile phone .
type your ent@@ angl@@ ed mobile phone of your left seat .
this quiet@@ ly connected from panic , which you now feel -- -- is exactly what you feel , when they open the door the first time .
because the only thing is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel like to keep the bl@@ iss@@ ed mobile phone of a foreig@@ ner in the hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
so feel most guests staying in the way .
only for this reason our company can exist .
only time so , who now has Al Gor@@ es mobile ?
could you pro@@ claim to the Twitter that he did for the president of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones now .
you have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build . I want to tell you about some disco@@ veries .
what if we would have changed a little detail in this experim@@ ent ?
what if your neighb@@ our would have been introduced only once with his name ; if he tells you what he comes , like his dog or his children ?
imagine you would have 150 Be@@ aches that all say : &quot; he can really very well ent@@ angl@@ ed mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you would have to retri@@ eve your mobile phone ?
because a well developed feedback system strength@@ ens the confidence decisive .
in the beginning we have made some things wrong .
it was hard for people to complete negative reference .
ultimately we decided to wait until both hosts and guest have given their Be@@ aches before we put them online .
last week we have discovered something new .
we have performed with Stan@@ ford a study . we talked about how probably it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar to them about age and residence .
little surprising we trust the people most who are most of the most ones .
the more differences we find , the less trust we trust .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a natural social benefits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thr@@ illing it will be when you add the call to a person -- in our case by Be@@ aches .
if you have less than three assess@@ ments , does not change anything .
but one has more than ten , changes everything .
a good reputation of the simil@@ arities .
the right design can thus help us to overcome some of our deep ro@@ oted .
also , we learned that trust is dependent on how much one can cost us .
here you can see the reactions to the first news of a guest .
if one tells too little , such as &quot; Hi ! &quot; , you get not an answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a lot as for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- -- the request is also rather believed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimal level of openness , e.g. &quot; Tol@@ le artwork in your apartment ! I do with my family holiday . &quot;
how can we create it with design to produce this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the tex@@ ture to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on which topics you should write something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our entire company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces against aliens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we had@@ n &apos;t expected , the great amount of people who were more than ready to present these pre@@ judi@@ ces .
here you can see how many people are entitled to our offer .
you can recognize three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third : a need , which was not covered before .
for us the shop is very good for us .
of course there are times if not everything smoothly running .
there were guests who have not allowed parties or apartments wo@@ und@@ ed .
hosts have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked with customer service . all calls came directly to my cell phone .
I stood on the front , when trust was broken .
there is nothing Sh@@ lim@@ mer@@ es as these calls . it is already hur@@ ting , if I only think of it .
the disappointment that one stops in the voice of the calls , and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve .
fortunately , from the 123 million over@@ sized nights only had a fr@@ action ever a problem .
because people trusted to face up to each other .
when trust is working , the miracle can arise .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there was a heart attack .
his host continued him to hospital .
he even ended blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travellers who tend to take full activities for cardi@@ ovas@@ cular activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with ample hospitals .
J@@ avier and Al@@ ej@@ andra are real pl@@ umbing that save one life , even though they do not know at all .
you drive an own car into the hospital when you die , and wait , while you get a b@@ yp@@ ass .
because they do not want you feel lon@@ ely , they bring books over .
you can even stay longer , without charge the extra charge .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
this way of course not runs every stay .
but these relationships behind the pure money trans@@ action is exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy .
when I asked for the first time about this term , I asked me :
how does the thought of sharing with money transactions together ?
this is an economic trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now it is simply &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing is not justified . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Share Economy describes a trade , human relationships promises .
people put a part of themselves , and that changes everything .
when you live today is to compare with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but also less auth@@ en@@ tically .
what would however if travelling a rich buffet from local impressions would be ?
what if you visited by any place , which you visited , a group there would be waiting to pass a group there to show a thorough and one at a pub in the district of which one has never heard ;
or if you could learn cooking from a Five @-@ star @-@ Koch ?
nowadays , apartments are designed in accordance with the principle of privacy .
what if we would like to make apartments of reason to work together ?
how would that look like ?
what would , if cities would accept the thoughts of a common part ?
I imagine cities that allow us to society and relations , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and deter@@ rent .
in the South Korean capital of Seoul , this project was already begun . many parks that belong@@ ed to the government ,
were now offered to residents . students who were looking for a lead .
were convey@@ ed to people whose children were drawn . there were inc@@ ub@@ ator programs initiated ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share economy , through our platform alone , night 785 000 people in 191 countries become a guest at a foreig@@ ner or yourself host .
the idea seems to be not as crazy as it was attached .
we have not re@@ inv@@ ented the wheel .
hospitality there were also previously mentioned .
there were also similar sites in front of us .
so why exactly is our works ?
apart from luck and tim@@ ing we understand that you can find the right design with the parts of the trust .
design can help us to overcome deeply ro@@ oted pre@@ judi@@ ces .
I find the f@@ aded ,
straight overwhelming .
I have to re@@ think any time when a rot@@ ating message to me is over .
of course , we know that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can soon be able to use .
thanks .
what do you think if you look forward ?
a belie@@ ver ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ res@@ sed , a brain s@@ la@@ under@@ mine , a tru@@ ess ?
or quite simply a delay in the security of security at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I do not give you the fault of your negative impressions .
so the media people represent , who look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of reporting about Islam and Muslims are neg@@ atively .
studies show : the Americans mean , most would not know Muslims .
probably the people do not speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to meet you .
I say to you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee pot -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a Mö@@ gl@@ ers @-@ Fitness @-@ fan@@ ati@@ k@@ erin ,
and I am an practic@@ ing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sing , because , baby , I was not so born .
I have decided to do this .
when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to buy myself .
no , not as hom@@ osexu@@ ality man , as some of my friends , but as Muslim . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my cop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist friends were ent@@ ails : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ose you yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Lu@@ st@@ ige was : back then it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , and in relation to the pressure that I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ ol@@ ds , to adjust me a perfect and Un@@ touch@@ able beauty .
I did not only supp@@ ose the faith of my parents .
I have with the Quran .
I read him , thought , asked in question , doub@@ ted , and believed ultimately .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and long dev@@ otion that is deeply sad@@ dened by reading the cor@@ ans .
the beauty of the rhyth@@ mic is sometimes bringing me to wines .
I feel myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel that somebody you truly takes you completely , and yet somehow loves ?
this is how it feels .
later I married and began , like all the good Egyptians , my career as engineering .
I later , after my salvation , a child , and lived basically the &quot; Egyptian American Dream . &quot;
then that hor@@ ri@@ ble morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had served at the end of breakfast , looked on the screen and saw the word &quot; E@@ il@@ Application . &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes in buildings , people sp@@ ran@@ ged from the buildings .
what was it ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned quickly to re@@ con@@ spir@@ acy .
why should you do something like that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I joined the television can@@ als and heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim terrorists &apos; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bing M@@ ecca ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh , my God .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not only attacked my country but in the N@@ U related me the works of others by a citizen in an sus@@ pic@@ ious . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the same day we had to drive through the Middle East the USA to move into a new city and begin with the reconstruction of the study .
I remember how I went through -- as we were sh@@ iny -- so deep it went into my seat , and I fear the first time to be recognized as Muslim .
we moved to this night into our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then heard , I saw and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organisations that said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sei@@ d careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rope in well illumin@@ ated areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vers@@ am@@ mm@@ ing you not &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed the whole week in .
then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather for fraud .
and again , the war@@ nings : &quot; does not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably approximate and I heard of attacks on Muslims or from people who lived for Muslims , into the Free and sm@@ ote .
there were really fire proposals on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something felt not felt right .
because the people that have attacked this country , our country have attacked .
I have stim@@ ulated the w@@ ute of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angr@@ y .
it is not easy to explain itself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
it is the in@@ noc@@ ence which are hard .
nowadays , we can actually say people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it means Muslims .
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to include Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as of a tum@@ or in the body of the USA .
there is only the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or car@@ ved ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant Tum@@ or is a whole as a whole and a ben@@ ign tum@@ or .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
Muslims are like all other Americans , no tum@@ or in the body of the USA , but a vital organ .
thanks !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , Er@@ ror and Olympi@@ oni@@ cles .
will make the closing of mus@@ een America safer ?
it might be sure to stop a few parking , but not to stop terror .
the regular visit of a mosque leads to people other faith toler@@ ated , and larger citizen participation .
and as I have a head of the police in the region of Washington , DC recently , told : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed before a computer .
during the radic@@ alization process , one has noticed that he will cut online . as one of its family , even by her family , so that the person believes that the person believes that the terrorists might be the true Muslims , and anyone who worship their behaviour and its ideology is a tra@@ itor or by faith .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we need to stop people to go to the mosque .
some will still maintain , Islam is a non@@ violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS has its brut@@ ality with the Quran .
as Muslim , as a mother , as a mother , believe I have to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would like to add them into their imagination , if you acknowledge them as representation of 1,6 billion believers .
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , as the K@@ u @-@ Kl@@ ux @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology Re@@ as@@ ons on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if you th@@ rowing a look at it , it is not driving what she is in her &quot; Holy Scrip@@ ture &quot; LA@@ SEN . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality which they can read these things into Scrip@@ ture .
an outstanding Im@@ am told me recently an amazing story :
a girl came to him because it would have put forward to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if they had been in contact with radic@@ als religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . each spiritual , with whom she had spoken , she brought them to silence , and told her , that their z@@ anger , their sense of inj@@ usti@@ ce in the world , they would only bring them into trouble .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by nothing inspired and something that have been given to their own sense , it was a main goal for the instrum@@ ent@@ alization by extremis@@ ts who spoke to a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Im@@ am put the connection to God and their church again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of trying to describe it for their W@@ ut , he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mosque , keep it before , to join the IS .
this was an insight , as the Islam@@ opho@@ bia me and my family concerns .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect every other ?
how affects the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear each day on our democracy , to our thoughts of freedom ?
a study -- actually show several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , pass at least three things happen .
we do not accept an author@@ it@@ arian government system , conformity and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
a study reveals : if you notice review messages where negative about Muslims has been reported , they were more military attack on Muslim countries as well as the circum@@ c@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not only a ak@@ ade@@ y problem .
when you look at when the mood against Muslims took up the above -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terror@@ ist attacks .
it happened in the advance of the Ira@@ qi war , and during two elect@@ oral periods .
so is Islam@@ opho@@ bia not simply the natural reaction to Mos@@ lem @-@ terror as I expected it .
it can actually be a tool for the mani@@ p@@ ulation of the public to express the foundation of a free society , the rational and well informed citizens .
the handling of Muslims is a spring of warning .
we might feel it as the first , but the tox@@ ic air of fear gives us all .
in the assignment of coll@@ ectiv@@ ism , it is not only about that to explain yourself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple , which lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both of the school went .
De@@ ah was a sport@@ s@@ men .
he was at the dental fac@@ ulty , talented , lots of promising ...
his sister would say to me that he was the sweet@@ est , we@@ al@@ thy people who knew it .
she visited him and he showed her his CV . she was le@@ as@@ hed and said ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; when is of my frat@@ ernity become such a versi@@ al young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neigh@@ bor , Cra@@ ig Stephen H@@ icks , she mur@@ dered , just as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ anj on the afternoon . he did it in their apartment , as with a execution , after having been post@@ ings against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he took eight times to De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism can not only be imm@@ oral , but also de@@ adly .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
are we gone to the mosque or we remain safe at home ?
we shared it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about to leave our children : one that would not exercise us through fear , or one , where we can ex@@ ert our religion freely .
we decided for the mosque .
with our son in the children , we drove sh@@ iny , with high pressure on the mosque .
I took him out , I went out my shoes , went into the prayer , and what I saw , left me .
the hall was rest@@ less filled .
then the tak@@ eover made an announcement , than@@ ked our guests , because the half of the gathered were Christians , Jews , Buddh@@ ists , credi@@ tors , credi@@ tors and non @-@ credi@@ tors , who had come to us , not to face us , but to join us .
at this moment I am broken .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion for panic and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism ?
are you going to be at number sure ?
or become connecting to those who mean , we are better than that .
many thanks .
thank you beautiful !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so Dal@@ ia , you seem to have a ner@@ ve hit .
but I wonder what do you say that you might think that you are going to keep a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thought @-@ in with dr@@ aught needed , in a no@@ b@@ ful thinking factory , so an exception and not the rule are .
what would you say to those people ?
DA@@ LIA Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , do not dec@@ ei@@ ve . I am completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as common as it is allowed .
if one over@@ look around the world around the world , and I did so with the biggest one of the study carried out the study along the world , people want to normal things .
they want to enjoy prosperity for the family , they want to work and they want to live in peace .
so I am not an exception .
if people seem like an exception to rule , then usually the rule is broken and they are not the exception to the rule .
HW : many thanks . DA@@ LIA Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for cra@@ fting , is standing in just before , a milli@@ meter business is going to be .
control , environmental surveillance , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of possible applications for commercial threats . possible , this is made in research institutes worldwide .
before air @-@ package settings in our social awareness , has a autonom@@ ous fleet of aircraft in France live at the F@@ RAC Centre in France live a six meters high tower of 1 500 bri@@ cks . a few years ago they started to fly with so@@ ap .
through inter@@ locking aircraft , high speed and acceler@@ ation on small space .
you can also build self @-@ employed structures .
they have learned to bear the burden to deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and generally react to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of the potential in the autonom@@ ous flight .
to work with it a system autonom@@ ous , it must know coll@@ ectively , where in the room there are the mobile objects .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on swift development of dynamic T@@ asks .
for the present demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology of Ver@@ ity studios , a uni@@ or of our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
every aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room to determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
external commands there are at the highest level . e.g. &quot; start &quot; and &quot; land . &quot;
this is a so@@ called H@@ eck@@ starter ,
one aircraft , which tries to beat two compartments with a cap .
like other star@@ ters is it in the down@@ ward journey efficiently , much more efficient than hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter in all its variations .
in contrast to most of the bar@@ code , it can flo@@ ating , and thus has large benefits in start and land@@ ing , and is very versatile .
however there is always a down@@ side .
a limitation of h@@ eck@@ star@@ ters is that it is sensitive to turbul@@ ence like wind b@@ ows .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the aircraft no matter in which position can be achieved and improved the performance by exercising .
okay .
during our research we often introduce fundamental abstract questions , which is at the core of the matter .
such a question would be for example : what is the smaller number of event@@ ual parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question .
hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter are known about as machines with a thousand movable parts , which co@@ aches to hurt you .
for decades ago we were able to fly ri@@ ots remote sho@@ cked aircraft , which had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a h@@ eck@@ ru@@ ary .
long we discovered that F@@ lies with just one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechanical simple remote cottage . it was inv@@ ented before short .
it has only a movable part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and Quer@@ y@@ der , no further actu@@ ator or Contro@@ ll@@ ers , only a prop@@ eller .
although it mechan@@ ically simple thing happened in the inter@@ iors very much so that it can be stable and move in space .
nonetheless , it does not yet have the elegant algorith@@ m of the hack . to bring it to flying , I have to look right away .
the prob@@ ability to throw it precisely if everyone can see is low , therefore I show you a video that was fil@@ med yesterday evening .
if the mon@@ ds is a practice in Genesis , this machine is here , the om@@ kop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ eller , a exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
you see that it is only symmet@@ ric .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
thus he receives the susp@@ ected capacity ,
to move in space in all directions , no matter in which direction it is fil@@ med or even as it rot@@ ating .
of course he is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ eller .
some things dar@@ ed in models , the rest will be learned directly at the camp .
see you this on .
when passengers should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is composed of two separate two @-@ room@@ ed aircraft machines .
this rot@@ ates in clo@@ ck@@ wise
and the other against clo@@ ck@@ wise .
if one is assembled , they beh@@ ave like a high @-@ performance @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ters .
however , a bit aw@@ ake -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- you can fly the machine if also restricted .
we will now demonstrate that by making a half flight .
the last demonstration studied synthe@@ tic shots .
the large number of autonomy , coordinated units enables a range of aesthe@@ tic expression .
we participated in the usual micro @-@ cu@@ cop@@ ter -- each individual weighs less than a sli@@ ce of bread -- and stat@@ ute them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . that is why there is no limit .
hopefully they motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine is there to practice on Broadway a flying l@@ amp@@ shade .
of course it is difficult to increase the influence of this technology previous .
for types as us is the sal@@ ary in development and creativity .
it serves as memory , as wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that there are creative , clever creatures which allows them to form a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such a massive commercial and economic potential , the bag is on the i .
many thanks .
1,3 million years ago in a very far distant galaxy two black holes each other faster , you walked so the mass tri@@ er s@@ uns in a t@@ tel@@ a tel@@ e in a pure energy .
this short moment leaves it more bright than all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of the whole of us known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but their energy does not put them in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was given into space @-@ time zones itself and the universe of explo@@ ded in Gra@@ vit@@ ation@@ w@@ ellen .
arrange the events of first time .
1.3 billion years ago it was a multi @-@ cell@@ ular life on Earth .
since then , the earth has a lot of things , cor@@ als , fish , plants , Sau@@ rier , humans and -- God stand by us -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group particularly cour@@ ageous -- R@@ ai White from MIT , K@@ IP Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from C@@ alt@@ ech -- to build a huge laser det@@ ektor -- to search for Gra@@ vit@@ ational w@@ ellen , which arise about a col@@ oured black holes .
most held them for crazy .
but enough people saw them as crazy indul@@ ge , so that the US National Science Foundation have financed their idea .
after decades , construction , design , conception and extremely much hard work built in the Det@@ ector LI@@ GO : the laser @-@ inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ ri@@ corn gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ observ@@ atory .
in the following time , the precision of LI@@ GO could be considerably reduced , which improved the recognition of potential .
therefore , it is now called Advanced LI@@ GO .
at the beginning of September 2015 LI@@ GO for a final test run is started to clarify a few minor problems .
on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ oured black holes across the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott H@@ ug@@ hes : only two moments in my life were emotional as this :
the birth of my daughter
and the far@@ ewell of my to@@ d@@ k@@ ran@@ ken father .
basically , the fruits of my life .
all this , what I had worked , is no longer Science @-@ F@@ ic@@ tion ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott H@@ ug@@ hes , theoretical physi@@ c@@ ist from black holes and their through observ@@ atories such as LI@@ GO mess@@ aging signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational shaft is a c@@ cl@@ us@@ ation in the feet of space and time .
when the ep@@ tu@@ bing of the wave will be the space and its full content into one direction and put into the others .
for illu@@ stration of the prof@@ ess@@ ors in courses on the Rel@@ ativity scene often a correct al@@ ber@@ y dance .
&quot; stretching and dust , stretching and dust . &quot;
the problem is that Gra@@ vit@@ ational w@@ ellen extremely weak , even ri@@ dic@@ ulous , are .
on 14 September , for example , each of us was war@@ ned by us at the meeting of the waves and stri@@ pped . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high .
that is called 20 N@@ ul@@ ls after the Com@@ ma , followed by a 1st per@@ um to the LI@@ GO @-@ staff for crazy .
with a five kilometers long laser Det@@ ector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be measured inside less than a thousand caps of a nu@@ cle@@ at of a nuclear cle@@ us .
at the end of his classic text about Gra@@ v@@ itation
described K@@ IP Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of LI@@ GO@@ s , the hunt for the waves of the following : &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such Det@@ ectors are cur@@ vy .
but physi@@ c@@ ists are dark , and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles . &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to LI@@ GO . Scott maintains , LI@@ GO be more a ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visibility light has a w@@ av@@ el@@ ength that is much smaller than the things around us : fac@@ ial , the size of your mobile phones .
this is quite practical . because so you can customize a picture or a map of things by getting the coming from several points of light around you .
in tones the different .
the sounds have a w@@ av@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that &apos;s why it is very hard , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that make you particularly much :
the face of your child is about .
instead we lau@@ re@@ ed according to certain characteristics such as clay and height , rhythm and volume to close to the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now speaks to Alice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bob breaks it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; dr@@ ummer Bob &quot; . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we cannot provide a simple images of objects in space with them .
but by taking changes in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can hear their stories .
at least lie for LI@@ GO the common frequencies in the audi@@ ble area .
so if we want to convert pet@@ ri@@ ster in Sch@@ all , we can hear the all literally .
the engra@@ v@@ itation to lau@@ g@@ ently , can tell us about a lot about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , giving it my colleague Scott already very long .
SH : two black , not rot@@ ating holes , cir@@ pen simple : w@@ up@@ p !
turn the two bodies very fast , you hear the same zir@@ cons with an additional key change . this sounds like : W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u !
it is a kind of motion , im@@ pregn@@ ated in the shaft form .
AA : on 14 September 2015 -- one date , which at least I have never forget -- heard LI@@ GO Fol@@ gen@@ y : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ des sound &#93; J@@ em@@ and , who knows how to listen , this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold solar dimensions , which is about as fast as the rods of your mix@@ ers .
AA : think of us briefly what this means .
two black holes , the dense physical body in the All , one with a mass of 29 S@@ onnen Früchte , the other with a mass of 36 S@@ onnen Früchte , the other with a mass of 36 S@@ onnen Früchte , the other with a mass of 36 S@@ onnen Früchte , the other with a mass of 36 S@@ onnen Früchte , the other with a mass of 36 S@@ onnen Früchte , the other with a mass of 36 S@@ onnen Früchte , the other with a mass of 36 S@@ onnen Früchte , the other with a mass of 36 S@@ onnen Früchte , the other with a mass of 36 S@@ onnen Früchte , the other with a mass of 36 S@@ onnen Früchte , the other with a mass of 36 S@@ onnen
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know what we heard it .
therein lies the consistent meaning of LI@@ GO .
LI@@ GO eb@@ net a completely new way of expl@@ oration of the universe as it never was possible before .
on this way we can listen to the All as and the invisible .
much in the space we can see -- virtually or fundamentally -- not visible .
a Super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why mas@@ cot stars in Super@@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de .
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about all of them .
the exciting physical procedures occur but at the core , which is hidden behind thousands of iron , carbon , carbon and si@@ lic@@ on .
we will never see , since these op@@ aque are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational w@@ gra@@ ving iron , as if it would be transparent glass . I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it , since the jud@@ ging covered by its own neighb@@ our .
using Gra@@ vit@@ ational vou@@ chers it should be possible until the beginning of reset .
and the probably cr@@ est : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen we never see , which we never will never see and from whom we have no idea . things that we can only discover by listen .
in fact I found LI@@ GO in the first run of things that we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the LI@@ GO @-@ Project , says to this issue : me : the kind of stars , the black holes , as LI@@ GO they are observed , are the dinos@@ aur@@ s of the universe .
they are enormous , ur@@ old body from pre@@ historic times . the black holes are so@@ coll@@ agen the sauce for our ar@@ che@@ ological work .
LI@@ GO enables us to completely different point of view on the events of all , to the emergence of the stars and ultimately it on how we went out of that chaos .
AA : the challenge is now to be as bra@@ ve as possible .
thanks to LI@@ GO we know how to build great Det@@ ectors and the Rau@@ ti@@ des and Zir@@ pen of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and all .
for what could be more beautiful , when the sign of himself is to lau@@ g@@ ish ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dreams with us .
thanks .
a while ago I have tried a experim@@ ent .
a year I would say to all &quot; Yes ! &quot; say , before I fear@@ ed .
no matter if that made me nervous about me in un@@ pleasant situations , I will tell me &quot; Yes . &quot;
I wanted to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
wanted to live live on TV ?
no , but yes !
I wanted to start with the foam ?
no , no , no , but yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly that to do , w@@ ov@@ or I fear , removed my fear .
my fear , speeches to keep , my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , weg .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , has changed my life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there was a particular yes that my life changed my life on an un@@ expected article It started with a question of my small .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Em@@ erson . and em@@ erson , the small , is called in@@ explic@@ able reasons all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kittens &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if they were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; behold , I need milk for my c@@ abling . &quot;
she asked me once I could play with her when I was just on the go . and I said : &quot; yes . &quot;
this yes was the beginning
a new way of living in my family . from there to s@@ aint me to play with them once you decide to make money . no matter what I just do , or where I go , I say to Yes -- every single time .
almost . I am not perfect , but I pain@@ ful me very .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , on our family .
but it also has a f@@ aded tribut@@ ing : only before short , I actually stood fully that the &quot; Yes &quot; -@@ S@@ agen for playing with my children my career was saved .
I have a real dre@@ am@@ job .
I am author . I think of things you aw@@ ake to life .
dre@@ am@@ job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dre@@ am@@ job .
I created television . I produ@@ ci@@ ere television .
I make television , in great style .
in this TV season I am responsible for supporting 70 hours of program into the world .
four television programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each show offers hundred jobs , which previously did not exist .
the budget for an episode of a television network can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode all nine days of four shows , thus all nine days 20 million dollars television , four television programs , three ep@@ iso@@ des : Sc@@ andal , 15 ep@@ iso@@ des : how To Get Away With Mur@@ der , 10 ep@@ iso@@ des : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America I run my TV series on Thursday morning .
all over the world run my series into 256 loc@@ alities in 67 languages for 30 million spect@@ ators .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV lessons , which I created themselves , and not only produces , so still ob@@ end@@ purely . I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans and to tell my stories .
four television series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camps , around the world .
do you know who that still does ?
nobody , therefore I am a Titan .
dre@@ am@@ job .
I would like to im@@ press it with it .
I say it , because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I say to you , so all of you who want to work so hard if you want to take a company , a country or a class@@ room , take seriously if I am talking to work so that I am not only on the computer , and fant@@ asi@@ ere , and it is right when I say , I understand that it is not going on a dream job to dream .
it &apos;s all a job , everything to work , everything else , everything swe@@ at -- no t@@ ears .
I work hard , hard and I love it .
when I deep@@ en the work , there is no other feeling .
my work provides always a country out of nothing .
it is , when I set troops on , as m@@ old I on a canvas .
as a dre@@ amed a high sound , slept a mar@@ athon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ onc@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechan@@ ically , exhau@@ sting and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , funny and distur@@ bing , clin@@ ically and rational , cru@@ el and reasonable , is the su@@ ms .
there is such a change in me if the work runs well .
a su@@ ms begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the su@@ ms sounds like a busy street , I could always go on her .
many people take note , when I think them the su@@ ms that I talk about writing that writing me joy .
do not understand me wrong that does it .
but the su@@ ms began as I started with the television production when I started to work and to work , to work and to work , I discovered this thing , this su@@ ms , this energy . the su@@ ms !
the su@@ ms is more than writing .
the su@@ ms is action and activity . the su@@ ms is a drug .
the su@@ ms is music . the su@@ ms is light and air .
the su@@ ms is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have so a su@@ ms , then you can not be different from the size .
the feeling , not different to be able to strive for size , no matter at what price .
this is called the su@@ ms .
or perhaps it also means a work@@ a@@ holic .
perhaps it is the geni@@ us .
maybe it is called E@@ go .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I do not know it .
I just know that I am not afraid of failure , and I know only that I love the su@@ ms .
I will only say to you , I am a Titan , and I know that I will not ask it in question .
to make a clear : the more successful I will , the more ep@@ iso@@ des , the more work there , the more things are the more things at the same time , the more observe me , the more scre@@ am I say more and more expectations there is .
the more I am working to succeed , the more you have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , not true ?
the country , that I scar@@ ed , the Marathon , which I have the army , the canvas , the high sound , the su@@ ms , the su@@ ms , the su@@ ms , the su@@ ms .
I like this su@@ ms . I love the su@@ ms .
I need the su@@ ms . I am the su@@ ms .
am I only this su@@ ms ?
and then it stops the su@@ ms .
revised , ex@@ agger@@ ated , ex@@ agger@@ ated .
the su@@ ms stops .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their m@@ om is a single worker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and Em@@ erson says : &quot; shame , I want to go to Sh@@ onda @-@ land . &quot;
there are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
you are baby @-@ Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the su@@ ms stopped .
the su@@ ms of the engine pet@@ ri@@ te .
I loved my work more . the engine was out of .
the su@@ ms did not come back .
my sw@@ amp was broken .
I did the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , passed , no rep@@ ent@@ ance , not deleg@@ ate , a Titan sleeps , does not exist , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no su@@ ms .
in me it was silence .
four television programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four .
four television programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a pre @-@ view tit@@ anium ,
everything was gray , I simply had no fun more .
and that was my life .
all that I did .
I was the su@@ ms and the su@@ ms was me .
so what do you think of what you do , the work you love , suddenly le@@ ased ?
I know , some may think : &quot; H@@ eul you out , bl@@ ö@@ der author @-@ Titan . &quot;
but you know it , you do you know what is doing , a ban@@ ker who knows a mother to be a painter , to know a mother , and knows how the su@@ ms feels , and knows how the su@@ ms are already known when the su@@ ms stops , who is it then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
if the song of my heart stops , I can survive in the silence ?
and then gave me my &quot; southern states @-@ wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; one question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way to the outside , late in and she says : &quot; m@@ om &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I already want to say No , when I are aware of two things :
first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , they called me not &quot; kittens . &quot;
they called no longer &quot; kittens . &quot;
when is that happens ?
I des@@ p@@ ed when I am Titan and my sw@@ amp , and here all changes my own eyes .
and so she says : &quot; m@@ um , mag@@ st you play ? &quot;
and I say : &quot; yes . &quot;
this is nothing special .
we play and see her sisters , we lau@@ g@@ h a lot and I read quite dramatic from the book &quot; Ever@@ y@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing exceptional .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in the lon@@ el@@ iness and in the absence of the Sum@@ mens , I cannot do anything except they fit .
I am focused .
I am quiet@@ ly .
the country , that I scar@@ ed , the mar@@ athon , which I came , the army , the canvas , the high tone - they exist no longer .
everything that exists is a sti@@ cky finger and moist@@ ur@@ ish k@@ is@@ ses , delicate voices , vig@@ il@@ encils and song , in which it &apos;s gu@@ ing , or whatever the girl in &apos; The Eis@@ royal is .
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so short that I can barely breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breath@@ ed .
play the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes on and an energy controller comes in .
and that is not immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the su@@ ms comes slowly back .
no full volume , hardly there , it is soft , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the su@@ ms , but a su@@ ms .
and now I feel myself , I would know a magical secret .
but let us remain with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something that we have forgotten .
the su@@ ms , the working environment , the Tit@@ an@@ men , which is just the replacement .
if I ask you ask who you are , when I am tell you who I am when I describe myself with the help of broad@@ casts and television , and how functional my brain is , then I forget what the real su@@ ms is .
the su@@ ms is not a power and it is not working @-@ specific .
it is dependent on the pleasure .
the true su@@ ms is dependent on love .
the su@@ ms is the current , which comes from the life of life .
the real su@@ ms is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the genuine Sum@@ men ign@@ ores the pressure of the story , the to @-@ completed tasks , the expect@@ ation and the pressure .
the real su@@ ms is simple and original .
the true su@@ ms is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps the wrong words to me , for which God said to me that I am a Titan am ?
it is just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
once my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this to the fixed rule , so I can deliver me as work@@ a@@ holic of any debt .
it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice when I want to hear the su@@ ms again .
I wished it would be so simple . I am not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing me not ans@@ ing , how to work .
the truth does s@@ ore ,
but I like it not to play .
I am always working , for I love it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I rather am at home &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; home &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this intervention is pain@@ ful , because what a person is working rather than to be the house ?
well , I .
&quot; &quot; &quot; every time honest@@ ly , I n@@ enne myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am to , is none of it .
we ras@@ en in the garden , before and back , hin and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play Ball .
we sh@@ red@@ ly so@@ ap bub@@ bles .
I feel mainly st@@ ei@@ f , ab@@ sent and conf@@ used .
I always ask for my mobile phone .
yet it is o.@@ k .
my children will show me how to live , and the su@@ ms of the universe comp@@ lies with me .
I play and playing games until I ask myself : why have we ever been stopped with the games ?
you can also say it ! they always say yes when your child wants to play with you .
maybe you think me for na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dreams .
you probably have quite right , but you can also do it !
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not Ri@@ h@@ anna or a mu@@ pp@@ et show @-@ figure .
your child is less interesting when you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my kids want to play at most 15 minutes with me , to make up with them that they want to make something else .
there are wonderful 15 minutes but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes me a Mari@@ enk@@ ä@@ fer or bis@@ cuit .
and his teen@@ ie @-@ daughter whole 15 minutes long with me , I am mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , more needs it not .
everyone can bring 15 minutes by a piece , even on a le@@ ak La@@ une &apos; Day !
15 minutes per piece !
no cell , no laundry , no distr@@ ust .
the day is short : dinner , the children is ready .
but 15 minutes are in !
my children are my well @-@ being , my world . there must not be the children . it applies to have the su@@ ms to feel a place for his soul free@@ ze .
it is not about playing with their own children . it is about joy ,
about the &quot; Games &quot; in general .
treat yourself the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find out and keep it up .
I am not perfect in this . I fail and I wins . friends meet , books read the day --
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training as I wanted to meet myself more and more .
15 minutes per piece , why not full 15 minutes covered ?
what can it be wrong ? nothing can be wrong ?
the su@@ ms came back in my free time . the su@@ ms seems to return if I am not working .
working does not work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months opens a door , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear my soul , she met me and my soul . she sent me to new ideas . I n@@ ut@@ t it in full breeding and love my job again .
I like the su@@ ms , but I love it .
I do not need it .
I am not the su@@ ms , the su@@ ms is not ... no longer .
so@@ ap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is now my su@@ ms .
the su@@ ms of life .
the su@@ ms of love .
the su@@ ms of the work is part of me , but just a part . and for this I am so grateful .
it is sn@@ apshot that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan , the journey to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and to more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier , I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the more clearly my head .
the more I play , the better working .
the more I play , the more I hear the su@@ ms . the land , which I scar@@ ed , the mar@@ athon , which I have , the can@@ es , the su@@ ms , the su@@ ms , the su@@ ms , the su@@ ms , the su@@ ms , the su@@ ms of the su@@ ms of life .
the more I feel this su@@ ms , the more makes this unusual , beb@@ et@@ ching , naked and new way of living in me wide . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this su@@ ms , the more do I know who I am .
I am author . I think of things I simply awak@@ ened you to life .
this belongs to the job , this means to live his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a little bit om@@ er@@ om@@ ic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and to more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you beautiful .
I am Neuro@@ surgery .
as most of my colleagues have to do every day with human trag@@ e@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a serious stroke .
for us , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other bodi@@ ly organs , a very low capacity to self @-@ healing .
after a serious violation of the central nervous system , the patients often have a consistent , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I have functional neuro@@ logy .
what is a functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the ner@@ ve functions through various surgical measures .
surely they have heard of one of the most prominent , the &quot; Fre@@ enh@@ ir@@ n@@ ants &quot; . thereby , one electro@@ de deep in the brain , in order to influence the switching circuit of the neur@@ ons so that the neuro@@ logical function improved .
it really is an amazing technology . she has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson , which suffered under severe lemon and heavy pain .
Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ cure .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was leit@@ ner @-@ medicine and worked day and night in the emergency .
often , I reconc@@ iled patients with sh@@ epher@@ ds .
you have to imagine that at Schä@@ del Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ mat@@ a , the brain , and the Sh@@ ape op@@ sy are cont@@ ent@@ ated .
to save life , one must re@@ juven@@ ate the skull @-@ pressure resistance .
for that one must sometimes remove a part of a st@@ ine brain .
instead of the ra@@ st@@ ine brain , we decided to analyse ourselves with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , the brain mass .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
cells from a tissue to grow , comparable to quite small children , which are taken out of your families .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , moisture and the environments to let them flo@@ ur@@ ish .
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts it was Jean @-@ François .
it looked under his micro@@ scope .
this was a great surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly as a stem culture . with great green cells , which are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells .
maybe you still know from the Bi@@ ology , that stem cells un@@ ri@@ pe cells are that can transform itself into every cell type of organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small n@@ ical of the brain .
it is surprisingly , this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made a further fascinating observation : regular stem cells are very active -- they are very fast .
you never die , they are imm@@ ort@@ al .
but these cells consu@@ me different .
they slowly divided up and after a few weeks they died even .
so we saw a new , wei@@ rd cell population , which looked like stem cells but differently changed .
we needed long to understand what they came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells hot sh@@ ort@@ in @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
you can make 4 % of our large @-@ min@@ ded cells from .
you play a very important role in our development .
at the stage of the fet@@ us they ensure the folding of the brain .
but why do they stick us ?
we do not know that .
we believe that they are involved in healing the brain , since we find it in higher concentr@@ ations near to brain l@@ esi@@ on@@ ations .
but this is not so secure .
one thing is however clear -- from these cells we received our regular cells .
we are standing in front of a potential cell source , the brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experim@@ ent .
we wanted a piece of brain from the non @-@ language area , and then the cells is exactly as cul@@ tured , as it was Jean @-@ François
and they are now colored to follow them in the brain .
in the last step we travel@@ ed them at the reception of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ ologist tran@@ spl@@ antation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ spl@@ antation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we travel@@ ed these cells into a normal brain death ? and what will happen if we irrit@@ ate the same cells in de@@ pre@@ dest@@ ined brain ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we could work with monkeys .
in the first scenario , we travel@@ ed the cells into a healthy brain , and we wat@@ ched that after a few weeks they were taken away , they go back home . the space is already occupied , they will not be used there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario , we add an injury to and irrit@@ ate exactly the same cells and now the cells remained preserved -- they was@@ hed too mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells , the rei@@ m@@ pl@@ anti@@ ated .
the evidence of which they show , are these small points . these are the cells that we in vit@@ ro , in the culture of Carin@@ thia .
here we could not stop .
do these cells also help a monkeys to recover from a brain of deer ?
so we trained three monkeys with a manual al@@ location .
you had to take the pell@@ ets from a tray .
this was doing very good .
when they had reached a stable surface level , in the last we in the motor Cort@@ ex the Hand@@ mot@@ ori@@ k area .
then the monkeys were par@@ aly@@ sed , they could no longer move their hand anymore .
just as it would happen with people , she reco@@ vered spont@@ ane@@ ously up to a certain degree , just as after a stroke .
the patients are par@@ aly@@ sed and then try to relax with the help of sculp@@ tural brain mechanism . she recover at a certain degree , just as the monkey .
when we were sure that the monkey has achieved its degree of spont@@ aneous recovery , impl@@ anted its own cells .
on the left side they see the monkey that spont@@ ane@@ ously reco@@ vered .
it can bring about 40 % up to 50 % of its original performance from prior to injury .
it is not so precise and not as fast .
now you see when we travel@@ ed the cells rei@@ m@@ pl@@ anti@@ ated : the same monkey , two months after the irrit@@ ation antation .
I can tell you what were also very exciting results .
since this time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can use them fre@@ ez@@ ing and later use .
we can use them in other neuro@@ path@@ ological models , for example at Park@@ inson .
but our dream still is still to impl@@ ant them at people .
I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal yourself .
many thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , which is wonderful , I am sure that it is now , several do@@ zen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who need it . &quot;
I in any case .
of course , the question of what the biggest obstacles are before you can begin clinical studies at the people .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the largest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill about two k@@ ilo@@ grams papers and forms to over@@ run this kind of studies .
BG : this is understand@@ able , the brain is very accurate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed the research and try to get permission to start the clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes , until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : this is difficult to say .
first , it depends on the approval of clinical study .
will it allow us to launch the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients .
it needs a long time to select patients to perform treatments and evaluate if it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
after that , one must apply to a multi @-@ centralized study .
one must first really notice that it is useful before you can offer this treatment .
BG : and that it certainly is , of course . J@@ B : natural .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thanks for your visit at TE@@ D and that you told us about it .
BG : many thanks .
democracy .
we in the West make a great mistake to consider them as a matter of course .
we do not see democracy as the br@@ ittle plant that is in reality but as invent@@ aris of our society .
we tend to consider them as in@@ ex@@ change@@ able op@@ acity .
we believe that capitalism leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great rep@@ ah@@ mer in Beijing have proved that it is quite possible to have a blo@@ oming capitalism and impressive growth while politics is completely un@@ democratic .
indeed , democracy with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- became un@@ ambig@@ uous that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- do not affect the austerity programmes that have been realized in Greece .
at this moment I thought that there might be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my sincere friends told me that democracy would be abol@@ ished , if they would change anything .
at this point I want to introduce a economic model for genuine democracy .
I ask you to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , we could save ourselves the democracy , but that we need a true and defence democracy .
for without democracy the societies of Gem@@ ini , our future will d@@ ü@@ ster and our great , new technologies .
on the subject of waste , I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction that is currently threatened by our taver@@ n .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I n@@ enne it is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ eg@@ ings@@ gi@@ val @-@ Parad@@ ox &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the school@@ den@@ berg , which th@@ rows his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the school@@ den@@ berg ,
but few recognize his tw@@ illing .
a mountain of un@@ used cas@@ h@@ flow , which may be too anxi@@ ous , however , which might be too anxi@@ ous to invest it there , where it could cause productive and income , with which one could urgently needed the school@@ den@@ berg and also all the things that humanity is urgently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I n@@ enne them two numbers .
in the past 3 months in the United States , in England and the euro zone , 3.4 Bil@@ li@@ ons US dollars , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , streets , equ@@ als , equipment and so on and so on .
3,4 Bil@@ li@@ ons US dollars just sounds a lot of money until you spend the same time in the same time and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did , except the fl@@ ot@@ ations and to advance the real estate prices .
thus to form debt and un@@ productive capital the tw@@ ins summit , which does not differ by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stag@@ nat@@ ing wages , more than a quarter of 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year deaths in the USA , Japan and Europe , they are not investing . just like O@@ edi@@ pus the investors who might not invest in which they might not invest . just like O@@ edi@@ pus the O@@ rak@@ el could be true that his son would kill him , if he will grow .
un@@ wanted the circumstances lead to it that O@@ edi@@ pus him k@@ ills .
this is my had@@ n with capitalism --
his extremely rig@@ er@@ der@@ ous Art. All the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talent , and especially all the technologies to finance , &quot; green &quot; technologies , which are crucial to the rescue of the Earth .
so democracy is the solution ?
I think already . but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as the company form , in which the Free and the poor as a majority of the government .
the ath@@ om@@ ic democracy of course closed too many --
women , foreigners , and of course sl@@ aves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it would be a mistake to make the significance of ath@@ om@@ ic democracy due to these ex@@ ten@@ ders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision to the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that they have the working poor in expression , and not only the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive that they have the right to political co @-@ determination with equal sp@@ we@@ ighting in questions of the state .
Ath@@ en@@ ian Democracy has not been kept for long --
as a cand@@ le that sh@@ ines very bright , it is also quickly hidden .
however , our today &apos;s liberal democr@@ acies are not their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , in the glorious revolution of 1688 , even in the American Constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on the free citizens and the working poor is based our liberal democracy on the values of the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , which was ultimately a stat@@ ute for the ruling class .
for the liberal democracy only came to politics as a complete separation of politics and economy , and the democratic process in government was established , while the economy -- is the world of corporations -- for a more democratic zone .
in our present democr@@ acies since the time , in which the separation of politics and economy began , an indispensable fight between the two , the economy gradually enters the politics and they are de@@ pri@@ ved .
are you wonder@@ ing why politicians do not have anything like this than before ?
it is not located on a de@@ generation of her DNA .
it lies that you can be in government today and nevertheless not in power because the power of politics is ab@@ dom@@ ed into the economy and separated the areas .
I mentioned my had@@ n with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is in about as a her@@ d of smoke , the so lasting the animals , of which they nour@@ ishes , dec@@ im@@ it@@ ated that they are at the end of that .
similarly , it is similar to the economy , which is the politics so far @-@ ni@@ fied by the economic crisis itself . the power of corporations grows , political goods are increasing , the overall economic demand falls and the managing director of corporations are to be angr@@ y to invest cash .
the successful of capitalism the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy distri@@ butes , the higher the int@@ ric@@ ings@@ gi@@ ples , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the welfare of humanity .
if this is true , it is obvious that we have to bring politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; reserves the control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of sl@@ aves , women and foreigners .
this is not a new idea .
the Marx@@ ist Lin@@ ke had this idea already 100 years ago and it wasn &apos;t very good .
the teaching of the Deb@@ ak@@ el of the Soviet Union should be the working poor only through a miracle a position like in ancient Athens , without new species of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : the working poor !
capitalism is doing it by doing low cheap labor and replaced by automation and robots .
the problem is , such as long economy and politics are separate areas , the autom@@ ating the tw@@ ins are higher , the waste , and social conflicts deeper , as it will be very soon as I believe -- in countries like China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must re@@ uni@@ te the economy and re@@ uni@@ te areas of economy and politics , and we consider that we consider the re@@ uni@@ fied sector , otherwise we will appear in a disease surveillance @-@ hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy who can appear in the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a documentary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question is therefore not whether capitalism has brought the technical achievements , which he caused it to survive --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is dis@@ solved by a D@@ yst@@ opy , similar to the men in &quot; Star Trek , &quot; in which machines serve man and put their energy into the research of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks with the sense of life .
I believe we may be optim@@ istic .
what do it mean , how could it look like this &quot; star Trek &quot; -@@ like ut@@ opia instead of &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ similar D@@ yst@@ opy ?
in practical implementation I would like to give you some examples .
in the area of the company : please make a capital market before you deserve money , while you work and in which your capital is followed by a working place , from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter what you just works -- is property of those who currently work in the company .
then all income from capital and from rede@@ em and the concept of wage labor is completely ob@@ sol@@ ete .
no distinction between those who belong to the companies , but do not work in it , and employee who work there , but not ranks more between capital and labour , no big g@@ aps between investment and columns , and ultimately no asc@@ ending tw@@ ins summit .
in the field of global political economy , please make sure that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which will be spent by IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of 20 biggest emerging countries &#93; , in the interests of all humanity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that the entire world trading in this currency will be tr@@ aded -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; &quot; -- and each government pays the sum which corresponds to the trade defic@@ it or the merch@@ ant of the respective country into a common fund . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine that these funds are investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world , in which investments are r@@ ary .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Ke@@ yn@@ es proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time not the technical means had to implement it .
today , we have it , especially in the context of a re@@ uni@@ fied policy and economy .
the world that I describe to you , is at the same time a liberal people , and mar@@ x@@ istic because they buried the separation of capital and labour in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and ke@@ yn@@ esian , global ke@@ yn@@ esian .
but above all others it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
we will wake up in such a world
or will we move into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar de@@ yst@@ opy ?
the answer depends on how we can decide in politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democr@@ ati@@ cally .
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you des@@ crip@@ ts you in your biography itself as liberal Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... doing that , the technological development will generate such a massive decline of the overall economic demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long st@@ agn@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by transfer@@ ring this crisis from a part of the earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing it , it will not only be our democr@@ acies , but also the countries whose interests of liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is correct , then Marx is quite relevant ,
just like Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a liberal Marx@@ ist , and how ke@@ yn@@ es , and that is why I am also completely wir@@ ing .
BG : indeed , and now we are probably too .
Y@@ V : if you do not know , you do not think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical statement -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein that said it . BG : in your talk gave Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers , you have very clear what you think about the sight of the West in China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democr@@ acies we have the noti@@ on of democracy .
as I said in my presentation , we have limited democracy on politics , during the area where the most of the economy plays a completely democratic zone .
in a certain way , if I must say so pro@@ voc@@ ative that China today resem@@ bles China today in the UK of the 19th century .
because -- remember -- we are ne@@ onate to connect Liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is an error .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art , --
he was especially sc@@ ep@@ tical , what the democratic development concerns .
what you can now watch in China , resem@@ bles the development , which we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China is now in@@ sufficient to do that which the West has done itself in the 19th century , and genuine after hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many list@@ eners are curious about your experience as a financial Minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I understand that that comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back to the first half months later ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal point of view , and very dis@@ appoint@@ ing , because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the euro zone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
namely to say thank you from the self @-@ suffici@@ ency and the continuous den@@ ial that ran a massive change line by the Eurozone and continues to build the development of the whole European Union .
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek presidency -- the way , the first proposal was to reveal this den@@ ial --
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s right to make . unfortunately , the powers within the euro zone , within the European group , continue to choose the den@@ ial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
if you are trying to sustain an economic system , which is not over@@ able , through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ an@@ ism in life , you might be dis@@ ap@@ ure a while , but when the shift happens , he happens ab@@ rupt and destroyed .
BG : what change can you be ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have any future if we do not change its structure .
BG : have you made any mistakes in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- seriously ...
if there is a finance minister , or any minister gives , after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he did not have any mistake , then this is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistake .
the greatest mistake was to sign the request for the extension of the period at the end of February .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe that there was an honest interest on the exchange of money , a common solution to find . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that was not .
they just wanted to bring our government only because they do not want to deal with the compl@@ ain@@ tions that ran through the euro zone .
they did not want to pass that for 5 years it has been cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nomin@@ al GDP .
is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the Troika of money , who has imposed us this policy and one : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ oss@@ al mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : in spite of all the , and despite the aggressive sub@@ ons of the talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is facing someone who lives and loves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my greatest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
for if they do not survived , the shared fli@@ ers will be destroyed , and destroy the European Union .
this will not be cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences alone for Europe but for the world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
when we ask ourselves the path of a post@@ modern 1930 to hit that it appears to me , it will be also un@@ bear@@ able for the future of Europeans , as well as the non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you are wrong in this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for you at TE@@ D .
Y@@ V : thanks .
by Ro@@ y Price , most of them have never heard , although it is probably responsible for 22 @-@ moderate minutes of your life on 19th April 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision to hit the Ro@@ y above three years ago .
Ro@@ y Price is conduc@@ tors at Amazon Studios ,
the TV @-@ production company of Amazon .
he is 47 years old , slim , has a refres@@ hing and describes itself on Twitter as &quot; films , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot;
Ro@@ y has a very important job because he is responsible for it , the shows and content out to produce the Amazon .
of course this is a very hard batt@@ led industry .
there are already so many TV series that can not select any one .
he must find shows that are very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are all right on this curve .
this curve is the rating distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB . the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review .
if your show is rated with nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows , the sweet@@ ness , where you have a season , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are there more of these ep@@ iso@@ des ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of Show .
on the left side , here at this end , shows how &quot; T@@ od@@ d@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on to this end of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ y Price does not necessarily take on the left side of the curve , because I think you have already very special intelligence about &quot; T@@ od@@ d@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the middle explo@@ iting , average TV -- the shows , which are neither good nor bad , they simply delight .
so he must ensure that he really is on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it is also the first time that Amazon is so doing something , therefore Ro@@ y Price does not want to risk .
he wants to create success .
he requires guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and chosen by an evaluation eight candidates for TV shows , then it produces the first episode in each of these shows and makes them online where they can watch them for free .
and if Amazon go out anything else , you do not understand it right ?
millions of vie@@ wers view this ep@@ iso@@ des .
yet they don &apos;t know that they will be observed when watching these shows .
they are observed by Ro@@ y and his team who will take up all .
you capture when to start the show , when to p@@ auses , which parts you ski@@ ds or to look at once again .
you collect millions of data to decide with this data then which show they should produce .
in fact , they collect the data , process these and it arises from the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com over four rep@@ ublic@@ s broad@@ ators . &quot;
they did this show .
knows anyone the name of that show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many to remember that show because it was not so good .
it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- since the average of this curve 7.@@ 4 is and Alpha house lan@@ det on 7.5 -- therefore something above average , but not exactly the same , wor@@ on Ro@@ y and his team .
about at the same time when another company has placed a top @-@ show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Ro@@ y he always uses data to find this a super @-@ show and he also uses data to it , but he makes it something different .
instead of a contest to host , he and his team joined the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x spect@@ ators , so the reviews that they give the shows , their course , what shows they like etc .
then use these data to find this small details about the viewer : what shows you like , which producers , which actors .
when they had all the parts together , they went a w@@ agon and decided to do not have a sit@@ com over four Sen@@ ators , but a dr@@ ama series about a Senator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; . Net@@ fli@@ x has a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; house of Cards &quot; gets an 9,@@ 1 @-@ rating on this curve . therefore exactly where they wanted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course is the question : what happened here ?
one has two very com@@ peti@@ tive , data ver@@ sion@@ ed companies .
they connect these many data with each other and it will work great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic were somehow form@@ ally , that that should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data for a decision that you meet , then you should make a good decision .
one has 200 years in statistics as Back @-@ Up .
this is optimized by very powerful computer .
the Mind@@ est what you can expect is good TV , or ?
if data analysis is not working , then this is something sc@@ ary because we live in a time in which we have more and more to statistics to meet serious decisions , far beyond television .
knows someone here the company multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no . OK , this is even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room comes ever in touch with this software . come in touch with this software , you are in prison .
if any one is in prison in the US and to dism@@ iss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether one dism@@ iss@@ al is done or not .
just as with Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad , will be whether a person will be good or bad .
average TV , 22 minutes , which can be genuine , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always creates the best results . this is not in mind that a company like multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data ver@@ se@@ est companies are now wrong .
yes , even Google makes mistakes too .
2009 announced Google that they through data analysis dis@@ rup@@ tions from flu , who can tell us through data analysis of Google research .
it worked wonderful and was a great news @-@ creation . the success gi@@ fted in a release in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked fl@@ aw@@ less , year round by year , until it suddenly does not work more
and no one could say why .
it simply did not work , this was again a sens@@ ation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data vers@@ ed companies such as Amazon and Google impro@@ per sometimes something .
despite all these faul@@ ts data , so in decisions of life , -- at work , at the workplace , in medicine .
so we should rather ensure that data are helpful .
also I know many difficulties with data . I work in the computer @-@ based gene@@ tics -- an area , in which some very kl@@ ing people un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions about how the decision for cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions by using data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be circul@@ ated .
have you ever have to solve a complex problem , you mainly need two things :
as one of all , you place this problem in its parts , so that you can analyze the parts of the parts ; as a second , you will set the individual parts again to get a relief .
sometimes you need to do this times , but there are always two things : apart and again put together again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are just good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how power@@ fully , can only help you lay a problem and understand his parts .
they are not suitable to res@@ end the parts again and then come to a conclusion .
there is another tool and we own all : our brain .
when there is something that the brain is good when the brain is good , it is parts and pieces again , even if the information is un@@ complete , then the information is invisible -- especially when it is the brain of a expert .
therefore , I think I was Net@@ fli@@ x as successful because they have data and mind , where they are also in the process .
they use data to better understand how to better understand what else would not be able . but the decision to take all these parts , once again put together a show like &quot; House of Cards , which was not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they entered a big personal risk with this decision .
Amazon is doing this in the wrong way .
they us@@ eless data to control all their decisions , first as they are for TV ideas , then as they chose &apos; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
it was a safe decision , because they were always saying , &quot; this will tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe that things go wrong when we start to control our decisions .
no matter how do they are , data are just a tool and not to forget that , this device is quite useful .
many of you will be ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ une or no @-@ question you have to get only the ball sh@@ ake in order to get an answer . &quot; most likely ... &quot; exactly here in this moment .
I will start it later with a Techni@@ k@@ demo .
I have made some choices in my life , whereby I should have heard in the ball onto the ball .
but , as you naturally know if you have the data available , you would like to replace these by a bit much un@@ lock , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so maybe the ball is wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it lies in us to make decisions , if we want to achieve something exceptional at the end of the right turn .
and I think this as a very heart@@ y message that it despite the great amount of data still needs to be paid , making decisions to be an expert in which what you do is doing and risks .
for at the end , it is not the data , but the risks which you end up at the right end of the curve .
thank you beautiful .
