<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won as New York Times-Times-Reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before the one had heard of Edward Snowden, wrote Risen a book, in which he was spectacular that the NSA illegal telephones of Americans have heard.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "but it is another chapter that should leave a constant impression." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">In this, he describes a disastrous US-secret operation, in which the CIA is literally given to Iran for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If the crazy sounds, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know, whom the chapter is not covered?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">Nearly 10 years later the government has been determined by the Risen and asked him to call its own sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train he became a symbol for the pattern of the government, whistleblower to condemn and journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to first constitutional, the media have the right to publish more secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it's impossible to apply this law if media cannot get this information and if they cannot protect their identity.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government at Risen anklopens, he did something that are many mutually replicted before him, he refused, and said that he would prefer to go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015 I lived Risen with the risk to go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, only days before the process, it was something exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, even though they were years for years, that it would be vital for their case, the demands of the government dropped to Risen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in time of electronic monitoring the reporter and springs can be found more and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of going to fail and Risen to make the statements, which could also get his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so, the Mediator, without his consent, his own phone-wise,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just as its e-mail-data, financial and bank information, its credit card, and even stimulating with the list of its flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of these information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblowers and practitioner.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is just one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama spoke in his approach to protect whistleblowers. but instead, the judiciary has more condemned than all US governments before him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how one can be one problem, especially because the government is too much from their work as a secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of that a whistleblowers to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we put the press release on the game which is to be protected by the first constitutional system, because the government has more and more possibilities to serve everyone.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as technology of the government allowed to handle the rights of Reporers, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">While you can get it from the moment in which they get in touch, rather than in the post, in the witness.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today, there is communication software that has not yet been written as Risen his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or telephone call.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is Securedrop, an open-source overflow system for whistleblowers, which was originally developed by the internet-famous, which was developed by us and is today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation at which I am working, developed further.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an e-mail to send you on a news website, such as the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send informations as in any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These will then encrypted and saved on a server, to which only the respective postal Agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So, the government cannot concede any more information, and many of the information they would demand, would not be published by default.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately governments all over the world are always new espioneer technologies that are all endangered us all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is to make sure that not only technologies like Edward Snowden have an option to get misconception such as Edward Snowden. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblowers.</seg>
<seg id="39">The information about misery in the supply of soldiers is modest and covered hospitals. or the next Environmental workers, the alarm to forge water from Flint proposes. or a Wallstreet insider who warned us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">At all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crimes, but to protect our constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016, the largest dislery of history has been released.] [the "Panama Papers" [what does this] [enormous money summen in tax havens have been hidden.] [what does it mean?] [what does it mean?] [what does it mean?] [what does this week have been made by news about a leak of 11 million documents in Panama with law firm of Mosbag Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and Lawyers to firms such as Mospack Fonseca and say: "okay, we need a anonymous company. you can set it up?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages how the whole system works, how it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands Prime Minister has come back.</seg>
<seg id="48">Also there is reports that a federation of the brutal syodicator of Bashar al-Assad has concled into tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is asserted that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia president Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend from children's collagen, one famous Cellisten.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be out there a lot of rich people and others who are nervous about the next release, and on the next release documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of a penthrillers or a John-Grisham-.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems to be wept away from you, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we see what?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and mighty being able to hide their assets in tax havens and not all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as healthcare, education, streets.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organisation, global Wages, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Throughout the world discuss media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens are used to hide their assets and wear -- something that we have been discussed for ten years and uncovered.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people appears this whole world very confusing, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always present it like a Matryodraked.</seg>
<seg id="60">So it has a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind those commandment.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really what matters.</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably, because there has not been a prominent Americans that came in these revelations.</seg>
<seg id="64">Well, it is not so that there are no rich Americans to hide their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But by principle, according to these tax havens function, Mospack Fonseca less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">Could we have a data on the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">Indeed, it is so that you need in some US states less information, less information needs to be found to found a company than to get a sign.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intrinence in the US has allowed to zogened from school children to school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has a scammers allowed, especially susceptible to despery.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Wwe wanted to find out how all this in practice looks.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">Thus, we sent a vereign investigator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our agents announced itself as Africans ministers to bring suspicious money into the US to buy a house, an yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "we shocked it really that all the proposals made by an attorney." "" "how he could make his money transfters." ""</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all predispense. none of these attorneys took us as a client, and of course nobody was handed over to the money. however, it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as an individual.</seg>
<seg id="78">"" "" "" "it is not about a single attorney, who has subordinates proposals." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single peak, reigned in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, by corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to deal with this, we must change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">This might sound all very trendable sound when we could do anything about it; as if nothing could have changed, as if it is always the rich and mighty.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a boutener Optimist I see that things began to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the last few years we have seen prstalls to greater transparency, which concerns the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic was found political attention by the British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 Summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU at the central government offices at national level, who really behind companies in Europe are and who are controlled.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is here behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have put a proposal made in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means of care in the U.S. and global for more transparency.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global WTH, this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind shredness.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need executives in the economy, who stand up and say:" Intransparent is not good for the business. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians that recognise the problem and end to it by laws this kind of intrinence.</seg>
<seg id="95">Together we can end the intransparent, which now enables this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering, finally exit.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, as I was almost unkidnapped and in the luggage of a red Mazden would be.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I made a hinterland.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Chevrolet remained and behaved my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my artwork.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a roadtrip through whole country. afterwards he would go to peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I lud him on a beer. he told me excited as he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">As we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him: "" "" where are you now night? "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing even worse:" "" "I don't know it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What are I now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who knows the situation not?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping area now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got him today! he says, he would go to the peace of peace, but I don't know if he is really plans. I do not want to land in the boot room of a corn!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small cone!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard me," "" "I got a bubble. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">A voice in my head said, "Wh, how to please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was in bed, I rigged to the ceiling and thought: "Oh man! what did I get there in it?</seg>
<seg id="114">A Wildstrange sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got a kind of fear that I went out of the bed to tenth to the door, and completed my bedroommates.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork which he bought from me depends today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has changed my view of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">Maybe the people who were sold me in childhood as strangers, actually friends that are just waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">People on my airmatratze to host, was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco I took the avimatratze.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's take a break, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost bankrupt, my roommate moves out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I believe, creativity can create it to be afraid of fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I talked to a designer Bed and Bed and Breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk including, a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and set up so-called "airmatratze and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast "[AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed with us for 20 dollars on the airmatratze on wood flooring.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we also.</seg>
<seg id="132">I am sure to decorate our cheese-ham simelted completely different because we made it for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We traveled with them through the whole city. when we were passed our last guest and the door of the castle fell, starrts Brian and I attended.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends while we could pay our rent at the same time?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Brads, joined us as developers.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented to the investors: "we want to create a website on the people public pictures of their private rooms posting, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the type of rooms, whose doors are closed when visiting us.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, they can then invite people to invite people to sleep at them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the missile would be.</seg>
<seg id="142">But indeed they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">Nobody that is still at Trost, would invest in a store, the strangers allowed to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we as children have met all that foreigners are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If one has a problem, one can rely on the things that you can get good. we could desperish.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we had learned that design is much more than just look and haptics -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We learned how to design objects however, but now we wanted by design immense confidence, between people who had never before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design something like this?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design confidence?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a cost, what degree confidence we are contacted.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-seconds experiment. it will force you out of your Comfortzone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumb high when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to use your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Type your entangled mobile phone of your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quietly connected from panic, which you now feel -- -- is exactly what you feel, when they open the door the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel like to keep the blissed mobile phone of a foreigner in the hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So feel most guests staying in the way.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only time so, who now has Al Gores mobile?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you proclaim to the Twitter that he did for the president of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we would have changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbour would have been introduced only once with his name; if he tells you what he comes, like his dog or his children?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 Beaches that all say: "he can really very well entangled mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you would have to retrieve your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well developed feedback system strengthens the confidence decisive.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we have made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to complete negative reference.</seg>
<seg id="175">Ultimately we decided to wait until both hosts and guest have given their Beaches before we put them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we have discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We have performed with Stanford a study. we talked about how probably it is that people trust each other, depending on how similar to them about age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprising we trust the people most who are most of the most ones.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less trust we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">"" "" "" "this is a natural social benefits." ""</seg>
<seg id="181">Thrilling it will be when you add the call to a person -- in our case by Beaches.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three assessments, does not change anything.</seg>
<seg id="183">But one has more than ten, changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation of the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can thus help us to overcome some of our deep rooted.</seg>
<seg id="186">Also, we learned that trust is dependent on how much one can cost us.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first news of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">If one tells too little, such as "Hi!", you get not an answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "as a lot as for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother" "" "-- -- -- the request is also rather believed." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal level of openness, e.g. "Tolle artwork in your apartment! I do with my family holiday."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can we create it with design to produce this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the texture to recommend the right amount of text. we also give tips on which topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">"" "" "" "our entire company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against aliens." ""</seg>
<seg id="194">What we hadn't expected, the great amount of people who were more than ready to present these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people are entitled to our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need, which was not covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the shop is very good for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times if not everything smoothly running.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have not allowed parties or apartments wounded.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked with customer service. all calls came directly to my cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood on the front, when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing Shlimmeres as these calls. it is already hurting, if I only think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that one stops in the voice of the calls, and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, from the 123 million oversized nights only had a fraction ever a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">Because people trusted to face up to each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">When trust is working, the miracle can arise.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there was a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host continued him to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even ended blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travellers who tend to take full activities for cardiovascular activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with ample hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real plumbing that save one life, even though they do not know at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive an own car into the hospital when you die, and wait, while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they do not want you feel lonely, they bring books over.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer, without charge the extra charge.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">This way of course not runs every stay.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction is exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I asked for the first time about this term, I asked me:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of sharing with money transactions together?</seg>
<seg id="226">This is an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but now it is simply" "" "rental industry" "", "the thing is not justified." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade, human relationships promises.</seg>
<seg id="229">People put a part of themselves, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you live today is to compare with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but also less authentically.</seg>
<seg id="231">What would however if travelling a rich buffet from local impressions would be?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if you visited by any place, which you visited, a group there would be waiting to pass a group there to show a thorough and one at a pub in the district of which one has never heard;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a Five-star-Koch?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, apartments are designed in accordance with the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to make apartments of reason to work together?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What would, if cities would accept the thoughts of a common part?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow us to society and relations, instead of loneliness and deterrent.</seg>
<seg id="239">In the South Korean capital of Seoul, this project was already begun. many parks that belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered to residents. students who were looking for a lead.</seg>
<seg id="241">Were conveyed to people whose children were drawn. there were incubator programs initiated,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the Share economy, through our platform alone, night 785 000 people in 191 countries become a guest at a foreigner or yourself host.</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea seems to be not as crazy as it was attached.</seg>
<seg id="244">We have not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality there were also previously mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were also similar sites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why exactly is our works?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing we understand that you can find the right design with the parts of the trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us to overcome deeply rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find the faded,</seg>
<seg id="251">Straight overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to rethink any time when a rotating message to me is over.</seg>
<seg id="253">Of course, we know that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can soon be able to use.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look forward?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, a brain slaundermine, a truess?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or quite simply a delay in the security of security at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you the fault of your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media people represent, who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of reporting about Islam and Muslims are negatively.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans mean, most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably the people do not speak with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to meet you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I say to you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee pot -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möglers-Fitness-fanatikerin,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am an practicing, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sing, because, baby, I was not so born.</seg>
<seg id="274">I have decided to do this.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old, I met the decision to buy myself.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as homosexuality man, as some of my friends, but as Muslim. I decided to wear the Hijab, my coping.</seg>

<seg id="278">The Lustige was: back then it was a feminist declaration of independence, and in relation to the pressure that I felt as 17-year-olds, to adjust me a perfect and Untouchable beauty.</seg>
<seg id="279">I did not only suppose the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have with the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read him, thought, asked in question, doubted, and believed ultimately.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>

<seg id="287">This is how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and began, like all the good Egyptians, my career as engineering.</seg>
<seg id="289">I later, after my salvation, a child, and lived basically the "Egyptian American Dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then that horrible morning came in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, had served at the end of breakfast, looked on the screen and saw the word "EilApplication."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, airplanes in buildings, people spranged from the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was it?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned quickly to reconspiracy.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should you do something like that?</seg>

<seg id="303">I remember how I went through -- as we were shiny -- so deep it went into my seat, and I fear the first time to be recognized as Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved to this night into our apartment, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">"" "and then heard, I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said," "" "Seid careful," "" "rope in well illuminated areas," "" "Versammming you not" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week in.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather for fraud.</seg>
<seg id="308">And again, the warnings: "does not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandably approximate and I heard of attacks on Muslims or from people who lived for Muslims, into the Free and smote.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire proposals on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something felt not felt right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people that have attacked this country, our country have attacked.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have stimulated the wute of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the innocence which are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Nowadays, we can actually say people: "there is a problem in this country -- it means Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to include Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as of a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">There is only the question: are we malignant or carved?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant Tumor is a whole as a whole and a benign tumor.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the USA, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, Error and Olympionicles.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will make the closing of museen America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">It might be sure to stop a few parking, but not to stop terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to people other faith tolerated, and larger citizen participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as I have a head of the police in the region of Washington, DC recently, told: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed before a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">During the radicalization process, one has noticed that he will cut online. as one of its family, even by her family, so that the person believes that the person believes that the terrorists might be the true Muslims, and anyone who worship their behaviour and its ideology is a traitor or by faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we need to stop people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still maintain, Islam is a nonviolent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS has its brutality with the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As Muslim, as a mother, as a mother, believe I have to do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would like to add them into their imagination, if you acknowledge them as representation of 1,6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam, as the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology Reasons on their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but if you throwing a look at it, it is not driving what she is in her" Holy Scripture "LASEN." ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality which they can read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because it would have put forward to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if they had been in contact with radicals religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was exactly the opposite. each spiritual, with whom she had spoken, she brought them to silence, and told her, that their zanger, their sense of injustice in the world, they would only bring them into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">"" "" "" "by nothing inspired and something that have been given to their own sense, it was a main goal for the instrumentalization by extremists who spoke to a solution." ""</seg>
<seg id="351">"" "" "" "this Imam put the connection to God and their church again." ""</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of trying to describe it for their Wut, he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque, keep it before, to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight, as the Islamophobia me and my family concerns.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect every other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How affects the 24-hour consumption of fear each day on our democracy, to our thoughts of freedom?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually show several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, pass at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We do not accept an authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study reveals: if you notice review messages where negative about Muslims has been reported, they were more military attack on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not only a akadey problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">When you look at when the mood against Muslims took up the above -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the advance of the Iraqi war, and during two electoral periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So is Islamophobia not simply the natural reaction to Moslem-terror as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool for the manipulation of the public to express the foundation of a free society, the rational and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">The handling of Muslims is a spring of warning.</seg>
<seg id="367">We might feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear gives us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collectivism, it is not only about that to explain yourself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple, which lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both of the school went.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsmen.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the dental faculty, talented, lots of promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would say to me that he was the sweetest, wealthy people who knew it.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him and he showed her his CV. she was leashed and said,</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "when is of my fraternity become such a versial young man?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne with her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, she murdered, just as the sister of Yusor, Razanj on the afternoon. he did it in their apartment, as with a execution, after having been postings against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He took eight times to Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can not only be immoral, but also deadly.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we gone to the mosque or we remain safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We shared it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about to leave our children: one that would not exercise us through fear, or one, where we can exert our religion freely.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the children, we drove shiny, with high pressure on the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, I went out my shoes, went into the prayer, and what I saw, left me.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was restless filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the takeover made an announcement, thanked our guests, because the half of the gathered were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, creditors, creditors and non-creditors, who had come to us, not to face us, but to join us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At this moment I am broken.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion for panic and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose in the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Are you going to be at number sure?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or become connecting to those who mean, we are better than that.</seg>
<seg id="393">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you beautiful!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have a nerve hit.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what do you say that you might think that you are going to keep a TEDTalk, a thought-in with draught needed, in a nobful thinking factory, so an exception and not the rule are.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>

<seg id="403">They want to enjoy prosperity for the family, they want to work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am not an exception.</seg>

<seg id="407">What started as a platform for crafting, is standing in just before, a millimeter business is going to be.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental surveillance, photography, film and journalism: these are some of possible applications for commercial threats. possible, this is made in research institutes worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air-package settings in our social awareness, has a autonomous fleet of aircraft in France live at the FRAC Centre in France live a six meters high tower of 1 500 bricks. a few years ago they started to fly with soap.</seg>
<seg id="410">Through interlocking aircraft, high speed and acceleration on small space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-employed structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to bear the burden to deal with turmoil and generally react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of the potential in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">To work with it a system autonomous, it must know collectively, where in the room there are the mobile objects.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on swift development of dynamic Tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For the present demos we use a new localization technology of Verity studios, a unior of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Every aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room to determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">External commands there are at the highest level. e.g. "start" and "land."</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a socalled Heckstarter,</seg>
<seg id="422">One aircraft, which tries to beat two compartments with a cap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters is it in the downward journey efficiently, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most of the barcode, it can floating, and thus has large benefits in start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of heckstarters is that it is sensitive to turbulence like wind bows.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the aircraft no matter in which position can be achieved and improved the performance by exercising.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research we often introduce fundamental abstract questions, which is at the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be for example: what is the smaller number of eventual parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopter are known about as machines with a thousand movable parts, which coaches to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">For decades ago we were able to fly riots remote shocked aircraft, which had only two movable parts: a propeller and a heckruary.</seg>
<seg id="435">Long we discovered that Flies with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the mechanical simple remote cottage. it was invented before short.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only a movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and Queryder, no further actuator or Controllers, only a propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it mechanically simple thing happened in the interiors very much so that it can be stable and move in space.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nonetheless, it does not yet have the elegant algorithm of the hack. to bring it to flying, I have to look right away.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability to throw it precisely if everyone can see is low, therefore I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the monds is a practice in Genesis, this machine is here, the omkopter with its eight propeller, a exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">You see that it is only symmetric.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">Thus he receives the suspected capacity,</seg>
<seg id="447">To move in space in all directions, no matter in which direction it is filmed or even as it rotating.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course he is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propeller.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some things dared in models, the rest will be learned directly at the camp.</seg>
<seg id="450">See you this on.</seg>
<seg id="451">When passengers should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is composed of two separate two-roomed aircraft machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates in clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">If one is assembled, they behave like a high-performance-Quadcopters.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, a bit awake -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- you can fly the machine if also restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate that by making a half flight.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration studied synthetic shots.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomy, coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We participated in the usual micro-cucopter -- each individual weighs less than a slice of bread -- and statute them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. that is why there is no limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully they motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine is there to practice on Broadway a flying lampshade.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course it is difficult to increase the influence of this technology previous.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types as us is the salary in development and creativity.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as memory, as wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that there are creative, clever creatures which allows them to form a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such a massive commercial and economic potential, the bag is on the i.</seg>
<seg id="468">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="469">1,3 million years ago in a very far distant galaxy two black holes each other faster, you walked so the mass trier suns in a ttela tele in a pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment leaves it more bright than all the stars together in all galaxies of the whole of us known universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But their energy does not put them in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was given into space-time zones itself and the universe of exploded in Gravitationwellen.</seg>
<seg id="475">Arrange the events of first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago it was a multi-cellular life on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, the earth has a lot of things, corals, fish, plants, Saurier, humans and -- God stand by us -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group particularly courageous -- Rai White from MIT, KIP Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- to build a huge laser detektor -- to search for Gravitational wellen, which arise about a coloured black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most held them for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people saw them as crazy indulge, so that the US National Science Foundation have financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades, construction, design, conception and extremely much hard work built in the Detector LIGO: the laser-interferometricorn gravitational-observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following time, the precision of LIGO could be considerably reduced, which improved the recognition of potential.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore, it is now called Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015 LIGO for a final test run is started to clarify a few minor problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two coloured black holes across the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional as this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell of my todkranken father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All this, what I had worked, is no longer Science-Fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist from black holes and their through observatories such as LIGO messaging signals. but what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational shaft is a cclusation in the feet of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When the eptubing of the wave will be the space and its full content into one direction and put into the others.</seg>
<seg id="495">For illustration of the professors in courses on the Relativity scene often a correct albery dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dust, stretching and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that Gravitational wellen extremely weak, even ridiculous, are.</seg>
<seg id="498">On 14 September, for example, each of us was warned by us at the meeting of the waves and stripped. the elongation of an average man was 10 high.</seg>
<seg id="499">That is called 20 Nulls after the Comma, followed by a 1st perum to the LIGO-staff for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five kilometers long laser Detector, and this is already absurd, this length would have to be measured inside less than a thousand caps of a nucleat of a nuclear cleus.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about Gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Described KIP Thorne, a co-founder of LIGOs, the hunt for the waves of the following: "the technical difficulties in the construction of such Detectors are curvy.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicists are dark, and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott maintains, LIGO be more a ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visibility light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around us: facial, the size of your mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical. because so you can customize a picture or a map of things by getting the coming from several points of light around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">In tones the different.</seg>
<seg id="510">The sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That's why it is very hard, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that make you particularly much:</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child is about.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we laureed according to certain characteristics such as clay and height, rhythm and volume to close to the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now speaks to Alice." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"" "" "" "and Bob breaks it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="516">"drummer Bob". "</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot provide a simple images of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by taking changes in the amplitude and frequency of waves, we can hear their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least lie for LIGO the common frequencies in the audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">So if we want to convert petrister in Schall, we can hear the all literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The engravitation to laugently, can tell us about a lot about the collision of two black holes, giving it my colleague Scott already very long.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, not rotating holes, cirpen simple: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turn the two bodies very fast, you hear the same zircons with an additional key change. this sounds like: Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of motion, impregnated in the shaft form.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on 14 September 2015 -- one date, which at least I have never forget -- heard LIGO Folgeny: [Surrendes sound] Jemand, who knows how to listen, this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-fold solar dimensions, which is about as fast as the rods of your mixers.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: think of us briefly what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the dense physical body in the All, one with a mass of 29 Sonnen Früchte, the other with a mass of 36 Sonnen Früchte, the other with a mass of 36 Sonnen Früchte, the other with a mass of 36 Sonnen Früchte, the other with a mass of 36 Sonnen Früchte, the other with a mass of 36 Sonnen Früchte, the other with a mass of 36 Sonnen Früchte, the other with a mass of 36 Sonnen Früchte, the other with a mass of 36 Sonnen Früchte, the other with a mass of 36 Sonnen Früchte, the other with a mass of 36 Sonnen Früchte, the other with a mass of 36 Sonnen</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know what we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the consistent meaning of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO ebnet a completely new way of exploration of the universe as it never was possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the All as and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in the space we can see -- virtually or fundamentally -- not visible.</seg>
<seg id="536">A Supernova, for example. I would like to know why mascot stars in Supernovae explode.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot about all of them.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical procedures occur but at the core, which is hidden behind thousands of iron, carbon, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see, since these opaque are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational wgraving iron, as if it would be transparent glass. I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it, since the judging covered by its own neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using Gravitational vouchers it should be possible until the beginning of reset.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the probably crest: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen we never see, which we never will never see and from whom we have no idea. things that we can only discover by listen.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact I found LIGO in the first run of things that we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO-Project, says to this issue: me: the kind of stars, the black holes, as LIGO they are observed, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, urold body from prehistoric times. the black holes are socollagen the sauce for our archeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">LIGO enables us to completely different point of view on the events of all, to the emergence of the stars and ultimately it on how we went out of that chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is now to be as brave as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGO we know how to build great Detectors and the Rautides and Zirpen of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and all.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful, when the sign of himself is to laugish?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dreams with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="554">A while ago I have tried a experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">A year I would say to all "Yes!" say, before I feared.</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter if that made me nervous about me in unpleasant situations, I will tell me "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">I wanted to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Wanted to live live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">I wanted to start with the foam?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, but yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly that to do, wovor I fear, removed my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear, speeches to keep, my social fear -- Puff, weg.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes, has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"" "" "" "yes." ""</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a particular yes that my life changed my life on an unexpected article It started with a question of my small.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and emerson, the small, is called inexplicable reasons all" "" "kittens" "", "" ""</seg>
<seg id="570">As if they were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"behold, I need milk for my cabling."</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked me once I could play with her when I was just on the go. and I said: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new way of living in my family. from there to saint me to play with them once you decide to make money. no matter what I just do, or where I go, I say to Yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I am not perfect, but I painful me very.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my children, on our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a faded tributing: only before short, I actually stood fully that the "Yes" -Sagen for playing with my children my career was saved.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dreamjob.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am author. I think of things you awake to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dreamjob.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dreamjob.</seg>
<seg id="584">I created television. I produciere television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make television, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for supporting 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four television programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each show offers hundred jobs, which previously did not exist.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television network can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode all nine days of four shows, thus all nine days 20 million dollars television, four television programs, three episodes: Scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America I run my TV series on Thursday morning.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world run my series into 256 localities in 67 languages for 30 million spectators.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV lessons, which I created themselves, and not only produces, so still obendpurely. I have to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans and to tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four television series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, camps, around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who that still does?</seg>
<seg id="598">Nobody, therefore I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dreamjob.</seg>
<seg id="600">I would like to impress it with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it, because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I say to you, so all of you who want to work so hard if you want to take a company, a country or a classroom, take seriously if I am talking to work so that I am not only on the computer, and fantasiere, and it is right when I say, I understand that it is not going on a dream job to dream.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, everything to work, everything else, everything sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work hard, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I deepen the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work provides always a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is, when I set troops on, as mold I on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As a dreamed a high sound, slept a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanically, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and rational, cruel and reasonable, is the sums.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me if the work runs well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A sums begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the sums sounds like a busy street, I could always go on her.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people take note, when I think them the sums that I talk about writing that writing me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Do not understand me wrong that does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums began as I started with the television production when I started to work and to work, to work and to work, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy. the sums!</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have so a sums, then you can not be different from the size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling, not different to be able to strive for size, no matter at what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is the genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it is called Ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I do not know it.</seg>
<seg id="630">I just know that I am not afraid of failure, and I know only that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I will only say to you, I am a Titan, and I know that I will not ask it in question.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make a clear: the more successful I will, the more episodes, the more work there, the more things are the more things at the same time, the more observe me, the more scream I say more and more expectations there is.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I am working to succeed, the more you have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, not true?</seg>
<seg id="636">The country, that I scared, the Marathon, which I have the army, the canvas, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then it stops the sums.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, exaggerated, exaggerated.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stops.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mom is a single worker.</seg>
<seg id="644">"" "" "" "Harper tells people:" "" "my mum will not be there, but you can write my Nanny." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerson says: "shame, I want to go to Shonda-land."</seg>
<seg id="646">There are the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are baby-Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1, when the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine petrite.</seg>
<seg id="650">I loved my work more. the engine was out of.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My swamp was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I did the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, passed, no repentance, not delegate, a Titan sleeps, does not exist, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me it was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four television programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four television programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a pre-view titanium,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I simply had no fun more.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">All that I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums was me.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you think of what you do, the work you love, suddenly leased?</seg>
<seg id="665">I know, some may think: "Heul you out, blöder author-Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know it, you do you know what is doing, a banker who knows a mother to be a painter, to know a mother, and knows how the sums feels, and knows how the sums are already known when the sums stops, who is it then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">If the song of my heart stops, I can survive in the silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then gave me my "southern states-waitress" one question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I am on the way to the outside, late in and she says:" mom "" "" you play? "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="673">And I already want to say No, when I are aware of two things:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I have to say yes to everything and secondly, they called me not "kittens."</seg>
<seg id="675">They called no longer "kittens."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is that happens?</seg>
<seg id="677">I desped when I am Titan and my swamp, and here all changes my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">And so she says: "mum, magst you play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">This is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and see her sisters, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatic from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in the loneliness and in the absence of the Summens, I cannot do anything except they fit.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quietly.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country, that I scared, the marathon, which I came, the army, the canvas, the high tone - they exist no longer.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything that exists is a sticky finger and moisturish kisses, delicate voices, vigilencils and song, in which it's guing, or whatever the girl in 'The Eisroyal is.</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so short that I can barely breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathed.</seg>
<seg id="691">Play the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energy controller comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that is not immediately, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums comes slowly back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it is soft, hardly audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel myself, I would know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let us remain with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something that we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the working environment, the Titanmen, which is just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you ask who you are, when I am tell you who I am when I describe myself with the help of broadcasts and television, and how functional my brain is, then I forget what the real sums is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is not a power and it is not working-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent on the pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">The true sums is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums is the current, which comes from the life of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The genuine Summen ignores the pressure of the story, the to-completed tasks, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The true sums is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps the wrong words to me, for which God said to me that I am a Titan am?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">Once my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this to the fixed rule, so I can deliver me as workaholic of any debt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no choice. I have no choice when I want to hear the sums again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wished it would be so simple. I am not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing me not ansing, how to work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth does sore,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I like it not to play.</seg>
<seg id="724">I am always working, for I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">"" "" "" "I rather am at home" "" "home" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="726">This intervention is painful, because what a person is working rather than to be the house?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">"" "every time honestly, I nenne myself" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am to, is none of it.</seg>
<seg id="731">We rasen in the garden, before and back, hin and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play Ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We shredly soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel mainly steif, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always ask for my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">Yet it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children will show me how to live, and the sums of the universe complies with me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and playing games until I ask myself: why have we ever been stopped with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! they always say yes when your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you think me for naïve, for a daydreams.</seg>
<seg id="742">You probably have quite right, but you can also do it!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you are not Rihanna or a muppet show-figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child is less interesting when you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My kids want to play at most 15 minutes with me, to make up with them that they want to make something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">There are wonderful 15 minutes but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes me a Marienkäfer or biscuit.</seg>
<seg id="750">And his teenie-daughter whole 15 minutes long with me, I am mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes, more needs it not.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can bring 15 minutes by a piece, even on a leak Laune 'Day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes per piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No cell, no laundry, no distrust.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children is ready.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my well-being, my world. there must not be the children. it applies to have the sums to feel a place for his soul freeze.</seg>
<seg id="758">It is not about playing with their own children. it is about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">About the "Games" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and keep it up.</seg>
<seg id="763">I am not perfect in this. I fail and I wins. friends meet, books read the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" is short for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training as I wanted to meet myself more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes per piece, why not full 15 minutes covered?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can it be wrong? nothing can be wrong?</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my free time. the sums seems to return if I am not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months opens a door, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear my soul, she met me and my soul. she sent me to new ideas. I nutt it in full breeding and love my job again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums, but I love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I do not need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the sums, the sums is not... no longer.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is now my sums.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sums of the work is part of me, but just a part. and for this I am so grateful.</seg>
<seg id="778">It is snapshot that I am a Titan. I have never seen a Titan, the journey to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and to more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functional. my campfire is still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier, I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the more clearly my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better working.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the sums. the land, which I scared, the marathon, which I have, the canes, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums of the sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this sums, the more makes this unusual, bebetching, naked and new way of living in me wide. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel exactly this sums, the more do I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am author. I think of things I simply awakened you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">This belongs to the job, this means to live his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">This is the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a little bit omeromic.</seg>
<seg id="792">"" "I said" "" "Yes" "" "to less work and to more games." ""</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="797">As most of my colleagues have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a serious stroke.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other bodily organs, a very low capacity to self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious violation of the central nervous system, the patients often have a consistent, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I have functional neurology.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">Surely they have heard of one of the most prominent, the "Freenhirnants". thereby, one electrode deep in the brain, in order to influence the switching circuit of the neurons so that the neurological function improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. she has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson, which suffered under severe lemon and heavy pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation does not mean Neuro-cure.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was leitner-medicine and worked day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often, I reconciled patients with shepherds.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that at Schädel Hirn-Traumata, the brain, and the Shape opsy are contentated.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, one must rejuvenate the skull-pressure resistance.</seg>
<seg id="816">For that one must sometimes remove a part of a stine brain.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of the rastine brain, we decided to analyse ourselves with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Cells from a tissue to grow, comparable to quite small children, which are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right diet, temperature, moisture and the environments to let them flourish.</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts it was Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">It looked under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly as a stem culture. with great green cells, which are surrounded by small, unmature cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Maybe you still know from the Biology, that stem cells unripe cells are that can transform itself into every cell type of organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small nical of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprisingly, this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made a further fascinating observation: regular stem cells are very active -- they are very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">You never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells consume different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They slowly divided up and after a few weeks they died even.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, weird cell population, which looked like stem cells but differently changed.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand what they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells hot shortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">You can make 4% of our large-minded cells from.</seg>
<seg id="842">You play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">At the stage of the fetus they ensure the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stick us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they are involved in healing the brain, since we find it in higher concentrations near to brain lesionations.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so secure.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is however clear -- from these cells we received our regular cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are standing in front of a potential cell source, the brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted a piece of brain from the non-language area, and then the cells is exactly as cultured, as it was Jean-François</seg>
<seg id="853">And they are now colored to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we traveled them at the reception of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we traveled these cells into a normal brain death? and what will happen if we irritate the same cells in depredestined brain?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we could work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we traveled the cells into a healthy brain, and we watched that after a few weeks they were taken away, they go back home. the space is already occupied, they will not be used there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario, we add an injury to and irritate exactly the same cells and now the cells remained preserved -- they washed too mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells, the reimplantiated.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence of which they show, are these small points. these are the cells that we in vitro, in the culture of Carinthia.</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkeys to recover from a brain of deer?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained three monkeys with a manual allocation.</seg>
<seg id="866">You had to take the pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">This was doing very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they had reached a stable surface level, in the last we in the motor Cortex the Handmotorik area.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then the monkeys were paralysed, they could no longer move their hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen with people, she recovered spontaneously up to a certain degree, just as after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralysed and then try to relax with the help of sculptural brain mechanism. she recover at a certain degree, just as the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the monkey has achieved its degree of spontaneous recovery, implanted its own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side they see the monkey that spontaneously recovered.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% up to 50% of its original performance from prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not as fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now you see when we traveled the cells reimplantiated: the same monkey, two months after the irritation antation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you what were also very exciting results.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since this time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can use them freezing and later use.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example at Parkinson.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream still is still to implant them at people.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal yourself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, which is wonderful, I am sure that it is now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who need it."</seg>
<seg id="885">I in any case.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question of what the biggest obstacles are before you can begin clinical studies at the people.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the largest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to fill about two kilograms papers and forms to overrun this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very accurate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed the research and try to get permission to start the clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes, until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: this is difficult to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us to launch the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It needs a long time to select patients to perform treatments and evaluate if it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">After that, one must apply to a multi-centralized study.</seg>
<seg id="897">One must first really notice that it is useful before you can offer this treatment.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it certainly is, of course. JB: natural.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thanks for your visit at TED and that you told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a great mistake to consider them as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the brittle plant that is in reality but as inventaris of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as inexchangeable opacity.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great repahmer in Beijing have proved that it is quite possible to have a blooming capitalism and impressive growth while politics is completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">Indeed, democracy with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- became unambiguous that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- do not affect the austerity programmes that have been realized in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment I thought that there might be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my sincere friends told me that democracy would be abolished, if they would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I want to introduce a economic model for genuine democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a mistake, we could save ourselves the democracy, but that we need a true and defence democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy the societies of Gemini, our future will düster and our great, new technologies.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of waste, I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction that is currently threatened by our tavern.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I nenne it is the" "" "Tegingsgival-Paradox" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the schooldenberg, which throws his long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the schooldenberg,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twilling.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cashflow, which may be too anxious, however, which might be too anxious to invest it there, where it could cause productive and income, with which one could urgently needed the schooldenberg and also all the things that humanity is urgently needed, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I nenne them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">In the past 3 months in the United States, in England and the euro zone, 3.4 Billions US dollars, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, streets, equals, equipment and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3,4 Billions US dollars just sounds a lot of money until you spend the same time in the same time and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did, except the flotations and to advance the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus to form debt and unproductive capital the twins summit, which does not differ by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of 25-54-year deaths in the USA, Japan and Europe, they are not investing. just like Oedipus the investors who might not invest in which they might not invest. just like Oedipus the Orakel could be true that his son would kill him, if he will grow.</seg>
<seg id="925">Unwanted the circumstances lead to it that Oedipus him kills.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hadn with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">His extremely rigerderous Art. All the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to develop human talent, and especially all the technologies to finance, "green" technologies, which are crucial to the rescue of the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">So democracy is the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think already. but before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the company form, in which the Free and the poor as a majority of the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The athomic democracy of course closed too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">"" "" "" "however, it would be a mistake to make the significance of athomic democracy due to these extenders." ""</seg>
<seg id="934">The decision to the Athenian democracy was and is that they have the working poor in expression, and not only the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive that they have the right to political co-determination with equal spweighting in questions of the state.</seg>
<seg id="935">Athenian Democracy has not been kept for long --</seg>
<seg id="936">As a candle that shines very bright, it is also quickly hidden.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our today's liberal democracies are not their roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy focused on the free citizens and the working poor is based our liberal democracy on the values of the Magna Carta, which was ultimately a statute for the ruling class.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy only came to politics as a complete separation of politics and economy, and the democratic process in government was established, while the economy -- is the world of corporations -- for a more democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our present democracies since the time, in which the separation of politics and economy began, an indispensable fight between the two, the economy gradually enters the politics and they are deprived.</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why politicians do not have anything like this than before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not located on a degeneration of her DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It lies that you can be in government today and nevertheless not in power because the power of politics is abdomed into the economy and separated the areas.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hadn with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is in about as a herd of smoke, the so lasting the animals, of which they nourishes, decimitated that they are at the end of that.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is similar to the economy, which is the politics so far-nified by the economic crisis itself. the power of corporations grows, political goods are increasing, the overall economic demand falls and the managing director of corporations are to be angry to invest cash.</seg>
<seg id="948">The successful of capitalism the "demos" [the people] from democracy distributes, the higher the intricingsgiples, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the welfare of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If this is true, it is obvious that we have to bring politics and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" reserves the control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Linke had this idea already 100 years ago and it wasn't very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The teaching of the Debakel of the Soviet Union should be the working poor only through a miracle a position like in ancient Athens, without new species of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism is doing it by doing low cheap labor and replaced by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, such as long economy and politics are separate areas, the automating the twins are higher, the waste, and social conflicts deeper, as it will be very soon as I believe -- in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">"" "" "" "we must reunite the economy and reunite areas of economy and politics, and we consider that we consider the reunified sector, otherwise we will appear in a disease surveillance-hyperautocracy who can appear in the film" "" "Matrix" "" "as a documentary." ""</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is therefore not whether capitalism has brought the technical achievements, which he caused it to survive --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is dissolved by a Dystopy, similar to the men in "Star Trek," in which machines serve man and put their energy into the research of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athener "Agora," in long talks with the sense of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I believe we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">What do it mean, how could it look like this "star Trek" -like utopia instead of "matrix" -similar Dystopy?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation I would like to give you some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the area of the company: please make a capital market before you deserve money, while you work and in which your capital is followed by a working place, from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter what you just works -- is property of those who currently work in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital and from redeem and the concept of wage labor is completely obsolete.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the companies, but do not work in it, and employee who work there, but not ranks more between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and columns, and ultimately no ascending twins summit.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy, please make sure that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which will be spent by IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of 20 biggest emerging countries], in the interests of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">"" "imagine that the entire world trading in this currency will be traded --" "" "in units of" cosmos "" -- and each government pays the sum which corresponds to the trade deficit or the merchant of the respective country into a common fund. "" "</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that these funds are investing in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world, in which investments are rary.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time not the technical means had to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today, we have it, especially in the context of a reunified policy and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world that I describe to you, is at the same time a liberal people, and marxistic because they buried the separation of capital and labour in the dustbin of history, and keynesian, global keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all others it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we move into a "matrix" - similar deystopy?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we can decide in politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You descripts you in your biography itself as liberal Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">"" "" "" "the reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... doing that, the technological development will generate such a massive decline of the overall economic demand, which Larry Summers as" "" "long stagnation" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from a part of the earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing it, it will not only be our democracies, but also the countries whose interests of liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is correct, then Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just like Hayek, that's why I am a liberal Marxist, and how keynes, and that is why I am also completely wiring.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: indeed, and now we are probably too.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you do not know, you do not think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical statement -- YV: actually it was Einstein that said it. BG: in your talk gave Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers, you have very clear what you think about the sight of the West in China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the notion of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my presentation, we have limited democracy on politics, during the area where the most of the economy plays a completely democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a certain way, if I must say so provocative that China today resembles China today in the UK of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">Because -- remember -- we are neonate to connect Liberalism with democracy -- that is an error.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart, --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was especially sceptical, what the democratic development concerns.</seg>
<seg id="998">What you can now watch in China, resembles the development, which we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China is now insufficient to do that which the West has done itself in the 19th century, and genuine after hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experience as a financial Minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I understand that that comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back to the first half months later?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from personal point of view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the euro zone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">Namely to say thank you from the self-sufficiency and the continuous denial that ran a massive change line by the Eurozone and continues to build the development of the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek presidency -- the way, the first proposal was to reveal this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">"" "it's right to make. unfortunately, the powers within the euro zone, within the European group, continue to choose the denial." ""</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you are trying to sustain an economic system, which is not overable, through political will and authoritarianism in life, you might be disapure a while, but when the shift happens, he happens abrupt and destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change can you be ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have any future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: have you made any mistakes in your time as a finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- seriously...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a finance minister, or any minister gives, after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, he did not have any mistake, then this is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest mistake was to sign the request for the extension of the period at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">"" "" "" "I believe that there was an honest interest on the exchange of money, a common solution to find." ""</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>

<seg id="1023">They did not want to pass that for 5 years it has been catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>

<seg id="1027">BG: in spite of all the, and despite the aggressive subons of the talks, you seem to be quite pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "" "" "my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is facing someone who lives and loves." ""</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if they do not survived, the shared fliers will be destroyed, and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not be catastrophic consequences alone for Europe but for the world economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">When we ask ourselves the path of a postmodern 1930 to hit that it appears to me, it will be also unbearable for the future of Europeans, as well as the non-Europeans.</seg>

<seg id="1037">YV: thanks.</seg>
<seg id="1038">By Roy Price, most of them have never heard, although it is probably responsible for 22-moderate minutes of your life on 19th April 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision to hit the Roy above three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is conductors at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production company of Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has a refreshing and describes itself on Twitter as "films, TV, technology, tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for it, the shows and content out to produce the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard battled industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV series that can not select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He must find shows that are very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are all right on this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the rating distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IMDB. the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is rated with nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"" "these are shows like" Breaking Bad "" "" Game of Thrones, "" "" The Wire "-- all the shows, the sweetness, where you have a season," "" "where are there more of these episodes?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of Show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left side, here at this end, shows how "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on to this end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">"" "Roy Price does not necessarily take on the left side of the curve, because I think you have already very special intelligence about" Toddlers and Tiaras "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the middle exploiting, average TV -- the shows, which are neither good nor bad, they simply delight.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must ensure that he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it is also the first time that Amazon is so doing something, therefore Roy Price does not want to risk.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He requires guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and chosen by an evaluation eight candidates for TV shows, then it produces the first episode in each of these shows and makes them online where they can watch them for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon go out anything else, you do not understand it right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers view this episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">Yet they don't know that they will be observed when watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team who will take up all.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You capture when to start the show, when to pauses, which parts you skids or to look at once again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">You collect millions of data to decide with this data then which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, process these and it arises from the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a Sitcom over four republics broadators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They did this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Knows anyone the name of that show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many to remember that show because it was not so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- since the average of this curve 7.4 is and Alpha house landet on 7.5 -- therefore something above average, but not exactly the same, woron Roy and his team.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About at the same time when another company has placed a top-show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy he always uses data to find this a super-show and he also uses data to it, but he makes it something different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of a contest to host, he and his team joined the existing data on the Netflix spectators, so the reviews that they give the shows, their course, what shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then use these data to find this small details about the viewer: what shows you like, which producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together, they went a wagon and decided to do not have a sitcom over four Senators, but a drama series about a Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards". Netflix has a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"" "" "" "house of Cards" gets an 9,1-rating on this curve. therefore exactly where they wanted. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course is the question: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competitive, data versioned companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data with each other and it will work great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic were somehow formally, that that should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data for a decision that you meet, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">One has 200 years in statistics as Back-Up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">This is optimized by very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The Mindest what you can expect is good TV, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis is not working, then this is something scary because we live in a time in which we have more and more to statistics to meet serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Knows someone here the company multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No. OK, this is even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room comes ever in touch with this software. come in touch with this software, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If any one is in prison in the US and to dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether one dismissal is done or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just as with Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad, will be whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Average TV, 22 minutes, which can be genuine, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always creates the best results. this is not in mind that a company like multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data verseest companies are now wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google makes mistakes too.</seg>
<seg id="1100">2009 announced Google that they through data analysis disruptions from flu, who can tell us through data analysis of Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderful and was a great news-creation. the success gifted in a release in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked flawless, year round by year, until it suddenly does not work more</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data versed companies such as Amazon and Google improper sometimes something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these faults data, so in decisions of life, -- at work, at the workplace, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather ensure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">Also I know many difficulties with data. I work in the computer-based genetics -- an area, in which some very kling people unimaginable many data to make serious decisions about how the decision for cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions by using data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be circulated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">Have you ever have to solve a complex problem, you mainly need two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As one of all, you place this problem in its parts, so that you can analyze the parts of the parts; as a second, you will set the individual parts again to get a relief.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you need to do this times, but there are always two things: apart and again put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are just good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerfully, can only help you lay a problem and understand his parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to resend the parts again and then come to a conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we own all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">When there is something that the brain is good when the brain is good, it is parts and pieces again, even if the information is uncomplete, then the information is invisible -- especially when it is the brain of a expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think I was Netflix as successful because they have data and mind, where they are also in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand how to better understand what else would not be able. but the decision to take all these parts, once again put together a show like "House of Cards, which was not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they entered a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon is doing this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They useless data to control all their decisions, first as they are for TV ideas, then as they chose 'Alpha House "as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision, because they were always saying, "this will tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe that things go wrong when we start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how do they are, data are just a tool and not to forget that, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it is amazing. for decisions using a Jaune or no-question you have to get only the ball shake in order to get an answer. "most likely..." exactly here in this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will start it later with a Technikdemo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">I have made some choices in my life, whereby I should have heard in the ball onto the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you naturally know if you have the data available, you would like to replace these by a bit much unlock, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So maybe the ball is wiser and wiser and wiser. ultimately, it lies in us to make decisions, if we want to achieve something exceptional at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I think this as a very hearty message that it despite the great amount of data still needs to be paid, making decisions to be an expert in which what you do is doing and risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">For at the end, it is not the data, but the risks which you end up at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
