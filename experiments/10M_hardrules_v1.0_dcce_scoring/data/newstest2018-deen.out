Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards , which will change your look at the city
a Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt speak to meet young people today .
a sep@@ ul@@ kap@@ elle , where now the S @-@ Bahn will now be established .
small gar@@ dener are generating the basic reason of farmers .
the oldest official map of Mün@@ sing encourages exciting stories to days .
it nervous when land@@ cards are not currently up to date .
that knows everyone who had to stimulate themselves because the Auto @-@ Nav@@ i took place a green meadow .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ l@@ ements , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als from Bavaria of the State government , everything else is currently very elabor@@ ate .
especially if you are compar@@ es with current online maps .
then , how cities and communities were changed in the spread @-@ area of the Münch@@ ner Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a Flick@@ r , which one cannot realize as such .
in the large over@@ picture postcard were surv@@ ey@@ ed for cities and communities in detail , so called Ur@@ posi@@ tional leaf@@ lets .
these emerged according to the data of the Bay@@ erische Ver@@ di@@ ary , between 1810 and 18@@ 64 and ent@@ ures the first Ver@@ messung of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader of Bavaria since spring 1800 during the Second Ko@@ ali@@ tion@@ war with Austria .
Napoleon did an overview of the occupied country and gave an top@@ ographic recording of Bavaria - of course to military use .
even if the French troops came down with peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville , from 9 February to the 9th of February , the current neighbours were created by the idea of a wide @-@ covered Bavaria card .
Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV . Joseph stick the project further , founded the &quot; top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische Ver@@ mess@@ y management .
the jud@@ g@@ ums for Munich comes from the year 18@@ 56 and is like all others on the website of the Bay@@ erische Staats@@ bibliothek .
the comparison of early / H@@ eute is at the example of the provincial capital .
the city has grown in all directions and has grown together .
one example of this is sub@@ we@@ ed that is relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
ship@@ ling was part 21 years after creation of the map , so 1877 , as a Münch@@ ner district .
today Al@@ um@@ ling is in the middle of the city .
the houses of sub@@ missions focus on 18@@ 56 along the current Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße which was named only 1878 to Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the insur@@ rection of the Bav@@ arian peas@@ antry against Austria 17@@ 05 .
where today is the West park , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : when Hin@@ einz@@ o@@ omen appears a smaller number of do@@ zen lines and numbers : hand@@ written num@@ bered plots from the so called &quot; Ur@@ tic@@ ing &quot; from which the basic tax was derived from the basic tax .
&quot; &quot; &quot; small plots from there today no farmers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a small gar@@ dener of the plant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land in sun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of sub@@ send@@ ed@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wiese , since the period of the Okto@@ ber@@ f@@ ests , was in the 19th century still a meadow - and no concrete bre@@ asts .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psy@@ chi@@ atric medicine .
in the Ur@@ posi@@ tional sheet you read in the area of today &apos;s Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen not only the street name &quot; on Gast@@ eig , &quot; or from the height &quot; On the ventilation &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße we once sp@@ elled people with mad@@ ness .
there was 18@@ 58 / 59 the Münch@@ ner circle @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anst@@ alt &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ves . &quot;
after 1872 @-@ appointed Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den the institution - those psy@@ chi@@ atr@@ ists , which is brought in relation to the death of King Ludwig@@ s .
&quot; he was advanced for his time and ended for example the Ank@@ ettes of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren .
in addition , he is forbidden to apply violence against domestic races , &quot; Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen which has dealt with for an exhibition at the age of An@@ st@@ alt .
for 280 patients had been first place , later was extended to 500 places .
some@@ time this capacity is no longer available - the reason for the construction of the b@@ sir@@ is old in hair 1905 .
there is since 2006 the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ east , one of the largest psy@@ chi@@ at@@ rien Germany .
at the A@@ real of former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt meet young people in the Münch@@ ner Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the Or@@ den war@@ b the building was built in 1920 and walked in a youth @-@ home training .
in the west , the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential houses from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children of the house &quot; Casa Don Bosco &quot; - in the architectural design of the Irish ren@@ anst@@ alt was destroyed during World War II during World War II .
the Mari@@ en@@ platz was awarded in 18@@ 56 as the main square , the Kauf@@ ing@@ er@@ straße was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War in the heart of Mün@@ sing .
the bom@@ bs of the Al@@ lies in December 1944 a lot of holes in the city center .
one big stayed up to today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business buildings and a pit @-@ cap@@ itals from the Middle Ages were once at the Mari@@ enhof where these days are working and take place on the second S @-@ Bahn line for the second S @-@ Bahn line .
with the sli@@ der , the old Munich card can be compared with the air @-@ image of today - and the hole at the Mari@@ enhof allowance .
Ci@@ tiz@@ ens@@ hip releases / Mis@@ sour@@ i for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the promotion of col@@ our@@ ful persons issued by a warning for col@@ oured people who travel due to discri@@ min@@ ating policy and the rac@@ ist attacks of the state to Mis@@ sour@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Ad@@ visory Board for the Federal State Mis@@ sour@@ i , which should appear to force on 28 August 2017 , as a number of frag@@ ment , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ aner , as a number of frag@@ ment , rac@@ coon @-@ based inci@@ dents in recent times throughout the country and here , &quot; it is stated in the opinion of the group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recently adopted law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder to win discrimination on minorities , as well as the prosec@@ ution authorities of the state , the dis@@ proportion@@ ate on minorities , to illu@@ strate the group , the travel allowance , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; they have violations of civil rights , people happen .
they are attached because of their skin colour , they are sm@@ iled or killed , &quot; said the president of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Ro@@ d Chapel , the Kan@@ sas City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we listen to complaints in such an incidence that we have not heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning that has issued the organization for a state in the USA .
the group c@@ ited inci@@ dents like rac@@ ist associations against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ enn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died in frag@@ ile circumstances at the beginning of the year , after having had no gas@@ oline more and was taken away by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i in prison , without a crime .
the Council also indicates a recent report by the Office of the General state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , in which it is shown that black drivers in the state 75 percent are more common than past@@ ure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and their families , friends and employees about what can happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to be ready to bring it cas@@ c@@ ation or let the relatives are travelling through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ dried dates back in 2015 100 H@@ ass@@ verb@@ s , according to the latest figures from the H@@ ass@@ ign@@ ing programme of the F@@ BI , which entered the state with regard to the number of such violations on the 16th place of the country .
the travel war@@ n is also a response to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law , which would make it more difficult to compl@@ ain a company because of residential or employment levels .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ LU ) was issued for Texas and Arizona , after the states have been adopted , the local criminal prosec@@ ution authorities to commit people because of immigration to further seg@@ reg@@ ation .
travel war@@ nings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Ministry for other countries , but in recent times , stakeholders have taken up the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
Wei@@ de@@ za@@ un@@ projekt is el@@ ement@@ ar
the fisher@@ man &apos;s Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ um project is a success project and will be continued in the coming year .
the CD@@ U @-@ Bundestag Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have given a picture to a picture .
at the Recht@@ sh@@ enhof of the family Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann met representative of the fisher@@ man CD@@ U town , together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs .
Markus Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann gave first insights into its operation , where he is 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of woods , 40 da@@ vi@@ k@@ he and also houses many young animals .
the &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ mil@@ ch &quot; is for him the alternative @-@ less mark@@ ings for the milk of his cows , so Sh@@ wen@@ de@@ mann .
at the table of the resort is exclusively regi@@ on@@ ales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since he is also a German @-@ president of fisheries bach , he referred to the Wei@@ de@@ za@@ un@@ projekt as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; primary &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can not produce sh@@ aking areas and do not manage each production .
the green area stands for much work , much m@@ ts can be processed with the motor sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been here with the conditions and with the Top@@ ics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 he assumed the el@@ astic operation and cultivated these without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zers , even if he does not lead to bio@@ production .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the commun@@ e has recognised the meaning of the Wei@@ de@@ za@@ un@@ project and is happy about the leaders promotion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported .
you hope so that the for@@ ear@@ ing of the areas could still be moved out for a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest treasure we have the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts on how to continue their operations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the may@@ or &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the farmers stand because of the promotion often in criticism
over the Wei@@ de@@ za@@ un@@ funding were fenced in 2013 a total of 25 plots of eleven participants .
the disclosure area is thus 40 hectares that can not be revealed by at least 2023 .
from the total cost of the total amount of 71 500 euros , half of the Leader is promoted , a quarter carried the municipality of fisher@@ bach .
thus , they love the farmers 12 610 Euro that had to invest in 16,@@ 2 km Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ um .
&quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann .
K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you are doing a really good job without farmers and landscapes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter White stood firm : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here are the best food produced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ s@@ spi@@ ke guidel@@ ine ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state promotion of past@@ ors .
the objective is the disclosure of the Black Forest .
prere@@ quis@@ ites is the presence of one of the L@@ PR .
furthermore , the in@@ dem@@ nific@@ ation area may not be sl@@ ap@@ sible ( hang@@ ing over 35 per cent ) and must be threatened by the for@@ ear@@ ing .
for the fisher@@ man Wei@@ de@@ za@@ un@@ projekt 2018 currently runs on the application of eight participants with 24 plots that would build just 16 km fence .
the disclosure area corresponds to 35 acres , the predic@@ ted cost lie with more than 112 000 Euros .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump will take the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is to begin when they begin the stat@@ ues .
the Americans also appreciate this way as any other - hence the organ of Sadd@@ am Hus@@ uss@@ ed Sadd@@ am H@@ uss@@ eins on the Fir@@ dos Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Mill@@ er , one of the key @-@ ide@@ ologies of the Tr@@ ump @-@ regime , he knew what he did , when he put an symbo@@ lic argument with J@@ im A@@ co@@ sta by C@@ NN on the proposals of the president to the dr@@ astic constra@@ ints of the leg@@ acy of immigration with the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Mill@@ er handle not the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of bo@@ died and Liberty ators had led him s@@ yn@@ ly when he had done it .
but he controls their significance , and in particular the meaning that you have written as the famous po@@ em by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after completion of the monument , his base was added .
as Mill@@ er A@@ co@@ sta p@@ imp@@ ly : &quot; I will not go down on a full thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom , which den@@ ies the world .
the po@@ em that you refer to which later was added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Mill@@ er is correct , but as he form@@ ulated it , it is not really about history .
it is about the contemporary res@@ onate words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state is not just any old obj@@ ectors , but the trou@@ ts of the poor : &quot; thy tr@@ endy , your poor , / your bed@@ side masses , which travels to breathe , free to breathe , / the el@@ ending waste of your rich co@@ asts . &quot;
there was never a time when it was better to see on our scre@@ ens .
Mill@@ er is not engaged in liter@@ ary criticism - he made clear that these people in Tr@@ umps are not welcome .
this conflict because of the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural debate : it is indeed a conflict in the meaning of America .
Lazarus and her friends who put themselves pra@@ ying their words according to their death on the basis - knew very good that they have made a high political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ an@@ ism by presented in a dre@@ am@@ eful classical image depic@@ tion of the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in its po@@ em is the feminine figure no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she himself has a different name : mother of the exclusive .
the connection of the po@@ em with the image is a brilli@@ ant femin@@ ist cou@@ p and a devast@@ ated attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ mus .
and just like Lazarus the meaning of the statue changed , the people wanted to switch from the right wing of this already for a long time .
the big cry of rush Lim@@ bau@@ g@@ h , a kind of John of the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , ar@@ ra@@ ved 2010 , that the Statue of Liberty nobody any@@ body , but rather an early Ne@@ o@@ conserv@@ ative be that the American Fl@@ ame in the um@@ ph@@ ins World br@@ inge : &quot; Lady Liberty goes forward .
she is supposed to carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch shall not den@@ y the way into the United States . &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ g@@ h here on something disturbed .
the meaning of the statue is quite and even a question of stand@@ point of perception .
the great rit@@ ual indeed of Lazarus consi@@ sted in it to see them as they have seen by the exhausted , but hop@@ eless people after long and often hor@@ ri@@ ble journeys on the de@@ cks of ships have been seen .
it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of men who seek refu@@ ge and improve a chance to improve their lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome that they must hear . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and of course , this is not the perspective , the Mill@@ er and Tr@@ ump ever want to recognize .
your F@@ ack@@ el is not supposed to illumin@@ ate the way , but the hat@@ red , which is their only source of power ,
Welt@@ meisterschaft 2017 : N@@ eil Black lo@@ bt &apos;s members of the team of Great Britain
E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle have remin@@ ds of a time when only two r@@ ots belong@@ ed to the team of Great Britain
the Performance Chairman of the Lei@@ cht@@ athle@@ tik of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member states of the World Championships was to make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record of Scot@@ tish Ath@@ l@@ eten was chosen for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe in Scotland a little special &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand and we will continue to continue until we find it , &quot; said Black .
&quot; I talk to people at the Scot@@ tish Institute of Sport and they think that something has done with what they did .
the Scot@@ tish athletes do that it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type at the corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely br@@ ill@@ ant . &quot;
several of the Scot@@ tish Ath@@ l@@ eten are medals of candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5.000 m track , while E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle was elected by the team for team@@ building .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ ie is quite mod@@ est .
your Captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were sch@@ ot@@ tically or where they were living or practic@@ ing out of the room and felt very proud and were very motiv@@ ated .
the passion and the genuine feeling that E@@ ili@@ ie was very natural as of course , were great . &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth @-@ silver med@@ all@@ ists , who will join their fifth world Championships on the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les with the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; is that 16 r@@ ots in the British team are .
Scotland has so far the best total number of athletes at the World Championships was seven , who were in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle @-@ range Mu@@ ir runs on this road and has placed five British rect@@ ory last year .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m rounds .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ tish , which one should be observed after a great season that included the victory for the British team Tri@@ als and the An@@ niversary Games .
Do@@ yle &apos;s remin@@ ds of their first World Championships when the only other Scot@@ sman in the team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell was .
the team cap@@ itals in says that they are &quot; enormous proud of the fact that many of their land@@ mark is not only part of the team , but in some cases also among the medals and with the fin@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is special to be chosen by the team that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was just a great honor to know that my team coll@@ agen for me and chose me , makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the vill@@ i that belong to the team .
it only shows how far we came .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes , who want to rise to Po@@ dien .
what is my speech as a chapter ?
yes , I think she went well .
I have proved that we are very happy that in this situation we are very happy as we have a home world championship .
so it really is important to put at home support and to benefit from it that we are back at the Olympi@@ ast@@ adion .
I &apos;m getting a second chance to go there and compete with compete and there will be just like a great atmosphere there . &quot;
block of critics via Facebook : Be@@ wir@@ b not to give you a public office if you cannot wear the fil@@ ing of .
the Father of our country knew some of the bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it wasn &apos;t long before the newspapers to sm@@ ote him because of the internal policies up to its political principles .
he sh@@ imp@@ ly in criticism , certainly .
but he did not put his critics to silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the year 1783 said Washington : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stup@@ id and stu@@ d we will run as the sheep for the conclusions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that brings me to Maryland to Govern@@ or Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an that has to work on to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gan@@ s staff have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people , and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties declar@@ ing him therefore at the beginning of this week .
the rod of the Govern@@ ors left the law@@ suit as fri@@ vo@@ l , and the online comment was full of a counter@@ reak@@ er with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; it is just Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a guy such as H@@ og@@ an .
this is a rep@@ ubli@@ ic Govern@@ or in a overwhelming democratic state which is amazing .
he has the second approval of the 50 Govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary neck .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with principles .
he was also very sent in this , Facebook as the primary means to connect with his el@@ ectors and play@@ able his ha@@ iry head to chem@@ otherapy on his side .
therefore , the block@@ ation of persons who come to the page of the Govern@@ ors - which is a public forum that is officially stated as officially and by staff who are paid by public taxes - un@@ necessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post def@@ ended Ho@@ gan@@ s Spre@@ cher@@ in Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse , the acts of Govern@@ ors and ar@@ gu@@ ards that the block@@ ation of the comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too simple to use the picture of Tro@@ l@@ len or sp@@ amm@@ ers or sp@@ amm@@ ers to use the online the whi@@ p .
the post office spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , a master and a priest , no troll@@ s .
they all said that their comments were resp@@ ect@@ ful , thoug@@ ht@@ fully and not prof@@ iting .
the priest mentioned the Bible in his post and app@@ eled on Ho@@ gan@@ s Catholic faith .
attorney in Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani by Bo@@ wie , MD . , was not bor@@ row@@ ed , but they asked for rab@@ bit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I comm@@ ited courteous that I was disappointed , that there was no reaction to H@@ ass@@ verb@@ s and other latest news &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote them in the Com@@ ments of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not appreciate this idea if a number of people will stand on the same topic then they become more rather than a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective commitment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the employees of the Govern@@ ors as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; , would probably name the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ language &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocked a critics or deleted a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in early time when you have done the same that employee were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical conduc@@ tors and to burn prot@@ esters and to bring them to silence .
but this is precisely what happens digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public officials that cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed that he calls Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is cl@@ oned from Twitter @-@ users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
the chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County de@@ ed the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Apostle James C. Cach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , as they named a voters of their Facebook page .
and in K@@ ent@@ u@@ cky Govern@@ or Matt Be@@ e ( R ) was also a visit to the AC@@ LU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so hard .
at the time Wash@@ ing@@ &apos;s had the time of affordable por@@ tos a similar effect as the internet .
the number of newspapers multip@@ ly between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous wall@@ et sm@@ itter on his leadership .
and even at that time Washington anonymous Tro@@ lle .
people , the p@@ seud@@ ony@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola &quot; , &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ k &quot; used , wrote all letters to newspapers , the Wash@@ ing@@ ton decisions made .
Peti@@ tions published its position on the contract by Am@@ ity , the trade and the navigation with Great Britain , according to the historical documents that were collected from the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project .
but he did not put them to silence .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses include the basis of our nation .
and true leadership means to accept this .
Ron@@ an G@@ ers@@ ty hopes for an official comfort at the Renaissance Club
the former Europeans No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope in the next three days at home comforts , since the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an was held at the 25th edition of the Scot@@ tish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , which led in the Ar@@ cher@@ field links to the end of the Ar@@ cher@@ field , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new Australia &apos;s name and in the name of the club @-@ founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he reached his glory , &quot; said refin@@ ement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the players will see this course from his best page , he is in a great condition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jerry made a great job than he placed this place .
he is a sti@@ ller of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great show@@ case for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English E@@ ales was looking forward to defend a master@@ y for the first time , although he won in his 32 @-@ year career both at the European Tour as well as at the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels special &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the in South@@ port heated player . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I have not defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open , since it was in year , after I had gained it from the program .
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories come back from the last year and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on , last year here .
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot;
Gary Or@@ r who came back to the European senior tour before his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year .
this event will be his first narrow performance since the A@@ ber@@ de@@ en Asset Management Scot@@ tish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s always a bit more if you play at home &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you can also feel this additional pressure .

in the past two decades , fewer people are died on the lung cancer in the past two decades .
to this result scientists of the university clinics in Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after our estimates are derived per year of 167 lung cancer for passi@@ vity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Studien@@ manager Hei@@ ko B@@ echer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he moved to his own study on this subject from 1994 .
back then , there are still 400 lung cancer for passi@@ vity per year in Germany .

&quot; nobody dar@@ es it , after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; says it .
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the High@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former h@@ oll@@ us@@ dic colony , who were in 1969 after a contro@@ versi@@ al referendum held in Indonesia , than just 1.0@@ 26 el@@ dest through a public envel@@ oping in front of the occup@@ ying stru@@ ct .
an existing movement that tou@@ ching the independence against the Dutch rule , turned up rapidly against the government of Jak@@ arta , who considers control over the region and ex@@ clude foreign journ@@ alist or legal notice .
in 2003 , the province became officially divided in Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , whereby the independent part of Pap@@ ua @-@ Neu@@ gu@@ ine@@ as is the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is such as it ö@@ de . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a mor@@ row 5 @-@ hour drive with the car .
there is no public transportation .
the city with approximately 19,@@ 000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , which are surrounded by Bamboo tor@@ ches , and from cor@@ rug@@ ged roofs , which were converted by R@@ ost in various yellow @-@ brown tones .
only very few laugh@@ s have made their journey here because journalists and practically no foreigners .

&quot; earlier we had only leaves of our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is an enthusiastic province , where 28 % of man live under the border of poverty and some of the worst children &apos;s relationship and alphab@@ et fish rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesian &apos;s Gold@@ land .
the biggest and profitable gol@@ mine of the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a plat@@ former province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 only in 2015 Fre@@ ep@@ ort has built the value of 3.1 billion US dollars Gold and copper .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has increased resources in the value of valued 78 billion US dollars .
however , these hor@@ seb@@ ack are however a source of mis@@ ery for the Pap@@ ua , which ensure the leg@@ acy of Ira@@ qi military ret@@ ained .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort local militar@@ ism and units between 1998 and 2004 nearly 20 million US dollars , including up to 15@@ 0,000 US dollars to a single offic@@ er .
the papers of greater autonomy are threatened by Golden G@@ ans and will be gr@@ acious .
according to the information of activ@@ ists , more than 50@@ 0.000 Pap@@ ua have been killed and thousands have been mur@@ dered since 1969 from the ind@@ on@@ ese military since 1969 .

&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as every week inci@@ dents , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia and researchers for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have intensi@@ fied , since Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an in@@ flow of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .

the Indonesian President of J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , in folk and as Jok@@ ow@@ i said , he said during his election campaign , ine@@ qualities the ine@@ qualities and the legal violations of Pap@@ ua .
the former Zimmermann saf@@ est 27 of 29 areas of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua has changed little and today feel the locals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we have voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i with the expect@@ ation that he will fulfill our hopes that the justice will be restored , &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
indeed , Pan@@ i@@ ai in fact only two months after the Jok@@ ow@@ is inaugur@@ ation in October a deep point .
on 7 December 2014 was a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , as two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle by the darkness .
the sh@@ rock@@ ed children said to them that they should turn their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers participated in her tone and came back later with four soldiers , so the local past@@ or Y@@ av@@ edt T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers , the bap@@ ti@@ tes had h@@ unted and sm@@ ote the group with their winn@@ ings , said victims and witnesses .
then hum@@ id of soldiers in the group of children .
a child , the 16 @-@ year Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard to hit that he fell into a com@@ a .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government Commission was put in fire and the things esk@@ ast@@ ed on the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered themselves at a football field in front of the local police station and the military command@@ ment centre to call justice .
you were cerem@@ onial Jag@@ ni@@ b@@ ows , and led the Wa@@ ita @-@ dance - in the circle and a bird@@ watching - by Pap@@ u@@ as mee P@@ ago @-@ trunk before .
some prot@@ esters began jew@@ els on police and military post .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers had sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses do more than three times , shoot she is dead , they say it in an official document of TI@@ ME , which is not released in the local media .
Y@@ er@@ emi@@ ah Kay@@ ame , 56 , the manager of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ quarter of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the dro@@ h@@ ash danger and called after peace and called for the crowd at home .
no one was in the mood .
&quot; when I turned to myself , I was suddenly shot in my left , he said TI@@ ME on the veranda of his col@@ our@@ ful wooden house .
Kay@@ ame knows still not , who fi@@ red , but says that the ball came up from the ranks of the gathered soldiers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fi@@ red , &quot; add them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was made three times , so his c@@ ous@@ in , the witness of the shooting .
&quot; I burned to him and subj@@ ected his body to be sure that he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who like many , he only carries a name , the TI@@ ME in thy mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I have k@@ iss@@ ed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the che@@ ek of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said Rep@@ or@@ se that his offic@@ ers wanted her stop only &quot; back , because they will be attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves if people &apos; dro@@ s to kill us , &quot; said the speaker of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner of Pud@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were wo@@ und@@ ed .
the news about the k@@ illing came only on the following day &apos; fil@@ tered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
three weeks holding Jok@@ ow@@ i in Jay@@ ap@@ ura a passionate speech , in which he vo@@ iced sympath@@ ies for families of victims and fluctu@@ ate the historical mis@@ ery in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to be resolved that this case is immediately resolved , so it will no longer happen in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
security offic@@ in@@ anto said in October 2016 that he had an external mechanism to define historical violations of human rights violations .
but the inter@@ talk began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most cases have occurred a long time ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 @-@ s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ er years .
the point is that we have committed to address these violations , but there are processes , which must run through , &quot; he said .
then he made a withdrawal when he said on 5 June in Jak@@ arta with TI@@ ME and said , he has no plans , in Pap@@ ua a compl@@ aint mechanism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead it is governed by law &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wir@@ ac@@ anto that called the UNO because of &quot; crime against humanity , &quot; said more than 1,000 deaths in Ost@@ tim@@ ors blo@@ ody crimes of 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Pap@@ ua have already been moved , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai inci@@ dent .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims took such claims with gri@@ m un@@ believers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed during the last three years , but there was no progress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear of later .
&quot; I have fear , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid of being arrested by the military , are afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us re@@ peti@@ te that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the inci@@ dent .
he says that he was be@@ aten from the military after he helped four the victims was buried .
&quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , sought the military to me , &quot; he says .
the shooting have not stopped .
on Tuesday took the Indonesian police at the vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a con@@ frontation between vill@@ ag@@ ers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma that ref@@ used to bring an un@@ conscious man to hospital , died a person and 17 others were wo@@ und@@ ed , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who had dr@@ unk in a nearby river , died on the way to hospital .
several vill@@ agers prot@@ ested before the sit@@ ing office of the company .
the police said that the vill@@ ager stones on offic@@ ers , which were re@@ formed by stim@@ ulated warning .
but locals say that the mobile Brig@@ ade ( Indonesian , param@@ il@@ it@@ ary police ) on the quantity of shoot began and a de@@ adly saved .
&quot; we were so in panic , we have fear that it will give reven@@ ge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the Hospital lives and witness , as the last one has been delivered quickly , so the TI@@ ME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hi@@ ding two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai @-@ parliament is called to draw the involved offic@@ ers to account and withdraw the mobile Brig@@ ade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a in@@ qui@@ eter for the Indonesian government .
the lack of sen@@ su@@ ous development strength@@ ens the dis@@ satisfaction of the stem authority , Mon@@ i , Dani and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many adher@@ ed to the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) to defend the vine , who claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by raising them spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and demonstrations of ind@@ on@@ esian soldiers .
some of the top @-@ O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Tian@@ he K@@ og@@ o@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a reaction to the last few years of thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai , were arrested in prison , under the pre@@ text of &quot; safeguarding of national sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some do never dive again .
among the people in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a trag@@ ic , conf@@ ection@@ er place . &quot;
poverty strength@@ ens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the bit ri@@ ce that is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is for locals .
bread is just out of reach .
the people here are building everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ lets .
agriculture is the task of women who can edit four or five fields of Sweet pot@@ ato .
they kept most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is being sold on the local market .
ten pieces of not@@ a tast@@ ed only 10,000 Indonesian Rup@@ cia ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
in the course of time economic ine@@ qualities between the local Pap@@ ua and the new migrants that have arrived at the airport Nab@@ ire in larger number .
the few jobs they are in the region , usually go to the better explo@@ it and we@@ al@@ thy migrants .
Pap@@ ua have rare the capital or the necessary skills to make their own business competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for here there are no jobs or money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the Chairman of the Board of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot;
insul@@ ating keeps the eyes of the world far off Pap@@ ua .
furthermore , restrictions of reporting international media are ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , the French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Basi@@ lle Long@@ cham@@ p because of the lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although gave them the rare permission to the movies .
according to P@@ hel@@ in K@@ ine , the dep@@ uty Asia @-@ Director of Human Rights Watch , the Provi@@ dence of Jok@@ ow@@ is elect@@ oral , the limitations of reporting to promote transparency and development , not realized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new haz@@ ards to foreign journalists , which try to report on an un@@ quiet at the provinces of Pap@@ ua and West pap@@ ua , and a black list , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press supervision means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March we demanded six p@@ aci@@ ers States - Tong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ ine and the sal@@ om@@ ones Islands - the UN Human Rights Council , the &quot; different and widely spread violations &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ shooting .
the same countries historically already seen the O@@ PM .
the spok@@ es@@ man of the ind@@ on@@ esian Foreign Minister of the Ministry of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha the sp@@ ection of the group back and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia still is a more democratic system , and there is free media so that it is difficult to negotiate the evidence of human rights . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people on site want to take more foreign governments to take note of this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human right @-@ mess@@ enger K@@ ees Van B@@ aar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura on 4 May visited , brown locals , &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also took part in the session , but anonymous .
Indonesia 2019 will tell a further presidential election but Pap@@ ua is that they will probably agree to the Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a human being who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai &apos;s , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the Chief Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , aside from that it is under the constant threat of a r@@ äu@@ er &apos;s military , lives in arm@@ ament and healthcare services .
Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , to look at their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; gu@@ ilt &quot; which he must pay back .
&quot; they do not need money , they just want justice , &quot; says he .
despite the threats and intim@@ id@@ ations led to families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ offering @-@ offering a last symbo@@ lic act of Trot@@ sky : the ly@@ che of a op@@ ter was buried on a ground exactly opposite the police and the military station .
they might know that they might never send justice to them , but at least they do not forget their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; said Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a little head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what else can we do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sk@@ ys@@ cr@@ apers from Dubai for the second time

it is the second brand , which is involved in just two years by the Hoch@@ haus , which is due to the tor@@ ch @-@ Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el tower ) .
the building was ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated , inj@@ uries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept , and we are up when up@@ loading and when writing people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran@@ ate the stairs down , and it took about 10 minutes to get from the 50@@ th floor down , &quot; told a inhabitants of his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Dub@@ ais Civil Avi@@ ation said that the units of fire fighting at 4.00 a.m. local time ( 0@@ 0.00 o GMT ) the fire proceeds and the building fro@@ zen .
the government said , she is working on the provision of accommodations for those concerned .
the inci@@ dent may have questions about the safety of materials , which are used in outside areas of sk@@ ys@@ cr@@ apers all over the world .
an investigation through the management of the go@@ ch @-@ building after its fire in 2015 discovered that the biggest part of the damage from the cl@@ adding , the outer clothes for decor@@ ating or insulation .

no Davis Cup @-@ Reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis verb@@ s ( IT@@ F ) is awarded by his great Davis Cup @-@ Cou@@ p during the General Assembly .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the award was supported for this Sport @-@ revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup single , only on two pay@@ lines , and @-@ thin @-@ thin not supported by the necessary two @-@ third majority .
the most often quite long , but even so very appreciated Five @-@ classics remain the traditional rating .
6@@ 3.6 percent of member states for reform , the objective of the IT@@ F @-@ President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members do not have the whole reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of this ic@@ onic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one will continue to work to improve the applic@@ ant .
not only at the vote was for many initi@@ atory before , the proposal came to a neutral place already before .
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively smaller details : so the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be in the first round the host @-@ law .
to reduce the costs of the organis@@ ers , the requirements in training courses , etc. are facilit@@ ated and the players will have to pass before the Davis Cup less official media occurr@@ ences .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers brings some objects into the plane , finds a survey
a survey led to passengers , that more than 20 percent are aware of or un@@ aware of the U.S. Department of U.S. administration , including at least 6 percent that betra@@ yed the plane , while they failed to get used kni@@ ves or other items with blades .
less than 1 percent said they had del@@ ayed that they have travel@@ ed anything with sh@@ allow weapons , am@@ muni@@ tion or spra@@ yers .
the survey with more than 1,000 persons - who carried out by a Jet @-@ Char@@ ter@@ service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ tered Inc . , was also confirmed that younger travellers rather make the rules ab@@ used .
by the respon@@ dents , the Zug@@ aben , that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was forbidden by the T@@ SA were 19,@@ 7 per cent Mill@@ enni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , members of the generation X were .
the most common items that were raised to T@@ SA @-@ agents , were foods and liquids .
more than 3 percent made , knowing items with blades through the security control , while 2,2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of the male survey was also confirmed , that they had already covered drugs in the plane .
the company said , it asked travelers in the whole country to find out how many failed have brought dirt through the airport and how many things had done .
it is not a surprise that people who like most of sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ware - wis@@ ely or ign@@ or@@ ingly - through the safety , those who were most often flying .
however , the enterprise indicates that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often un@@ certain that liquids they are allowed or how much of it .
thus , there is no surprise that the biggest amount of those of the T@@ SA hi@@ ed objects .
a while ago the people , the T@@ SA could see books as sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ware .
liquids is allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is no matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la @-@ customer order
e @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ as@@ sa El@@ on Mus@@ k are available with the huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
so he has under@@ gone up so that some of the customers already returned their non @-@ binding reservation already .
besides the always tri@@ um@@ ph@@ ant numbers to sales and still gig@@ antic de@@ position , Tes@@ la @-@ chef has betra@@ y a different , less gl@@ itter@@ ing number : the cancell@@ ations made in the new mass market model 3 .
Mus@@ k had often rolled out in recent months with the more than 500@@ ,000 pre@@ orders for the new car whose delivery straight starts .
now sp@@ ati@@ t Mus@@ k one : from the total of 285 pre@@ orders have been returned again for 6@@ 2.000 already .
critics always had pointed out again that it is merely a non @-@ binding reservations .
in a cancellation , Tes@@ la the 1000 Euro ( in the USA 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) is completely back .
currently , 45@@ 5.000 of such non @-@ binding reservations made before , sp@@ ati@@ te Mus@@ k in a phone conference with analy@@ sts .
that the cancellation of so far has been around twelve percent of all orders to the problem , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe .
its argument : the challenge for ambitious European aim is not in demand but on the production page .
last year Tes@@ la 8@@ 4,000 vehicles have been delivered .
for 2018 - all models are put together - 50@@ 0.000 , 2020 a million .
the demand for this is evident .
according to Mus@@ k currently hail a day 1800 reservations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who today is a &quot; model &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; , it should be at the ear@@ liest of the second half of 2018 with the delivery - if Tes@@ la it creates , its brand new , nor ever in the practice of roads without larger inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum utilization .
many experts make it possible that this is possible .
but there is too much del@@ ays , then the gi@@ veness of reservations may become a problem for Tes@@ la .

one day after having been cl@@ oned off from 15 countries , Scott took place , the chief of the environmental authority , his former decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions smo@@ g @-@ causing bub@@ bles .
Pru@@ itt presented the change , when its agency proved to be the needs of state environmental authorities , to re@@ claim@@ ing faster than previous devast@@ ation .
he did not mention the law@@ suit , which was raised against his previous job in a Federal Court of occupation .
it is a time limit that ran on 1 October for states to keep the standards of 2015 for ground @-@ up o@@ zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pru@@ itt announced in June that he will spend a year to study up a year , to study the plan more time to study the plan and avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in local choices or economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pru@@ itt , who was founded prior to his appointment by president Donald Tr@@ ump of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , a long time was a reliable opponent of environmental protection regulations .
since his arrival in Washington is clear to block , regulations to block or negoti@@ ating to educ@@ ate the chemical industry and industry of fos@@ sil fuels .
the su@@ dden conversion from Wednesday is the latest legal return for the Pru@@ d@@ atory wheel@@ set agenda .
last month has decided the Federal Constitu@@ tional Court in Washington decided that the E@@ PA Ver@@ wal@@ ker has passed his authority as he tried to negotiate the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas supplies for monitoring and reduction of meth@@ ane lec@@ turer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an afternoon position published opinion , Pru@@ d@@ ined that his K@@ ehr@@ t@@ wende in O@@ zone standards is quite simply the willingness of the E@@ PA to cooperate with the states by the complex process of timely performance of new standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under former governments the E@@ PA often have observed the deadlines for carrying out and then wa@@ ited for implementing activ@@ ists and others , and in an agreement to establish the appointment for the execution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pru@@ itt , who de@@ pl@@ ated the E@@ PA more than a do@@ zen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by court procedures , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority that gives us to us seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the opinion of the E@@ PA , that we will eventually make his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; powers to the failure and all other legally made full @-@ made &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that rules &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a solid policy and the best available information is based . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the Congress will push for a wider en@@ su@@ itability of the O@@ zone regul@@ ate .
a last month of law approved the implementation of the rules of 2015 by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet made available in the Senate .
the New Yor@@ ker @-@ sta@@ ats@@ n@@ g@@ ator Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who reported the coalition of the states that reported the E@@ PA in this week , said the Group intend to maintain the legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of the E@@ PA - according to our applic@@ ants - is an important profit for health and security of these 6.7 million New Yor@@ kers , and the above 115 million Americans who are directly affected by smo@@ g , which flows in their communities &quot; said C@@ utting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York closed in this case California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Maine , Massach@@ us@@ etts , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ies , Rho@@ de Island , Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
ground @-@ o@@ zone occurs when poll@@ ut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refined , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere on sun@@ light .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause sensitive groups of people serious air@@ problems , and every year to thousands of premature death .
representative of the public health property and the environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered about Pru@@ pr@@ enti@@ ent lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is wor@@ rying about how much pressure it needs to get this reasonable step by the responsible for the protection of air that we breathe out , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to fight against the ide@@ ological crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump @-@ government to fight against environmental pollution and their special interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

there are also people there .
as from the description of the upper @-@ state Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 highlighted , in addition to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which today is still in the picture of Tum@@ ings , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the settlement of the village .
old maps from the time around the year 1600 sub@@ sets this historical condition .
the Pat@@ ron@@ ats@@ Law was born from the early medieval stat@@ ute .
a Lord , who built a church , held with a priest , and continued in the church of the Church and could also inher@@ it these peculi@@ arities .
associated with it was the right to use a priest or the bishop of a new parish .
three alt@@ ars there were in the church and two bells on the tower .
the larger of the two zer@@ bar@@ st at Christmas 1673 .
the newly created bell was then used for the first time and had to be handed over later in the Second World War in 1942 .
in the 30 @-@ year war ( dropped to 1648 ) the shut@@ ters were assembled and the bells are st@@ olen .
the roof was un@@ dense .
1796 stre@@ amed French troops in the vicinity of the church .
you brown the pul@@ pit and p@@ enst@@ ühle and used them as fire@@ wood .

until 1869 served the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery can also be used as the last re @-@ place for the dead from Hör@@ ea .
1823 was enlarged by the gra@@ vey@@ ard and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was broken .
merely the cherry @-@ ur@@ m we left .
in the New Year of 1834 , a storm the Kir@@ cht@@ ur@@ m and half over@@ thre@@ w .
to avoid an un@@ happiness , the tower was broken .
only the existing Tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g remained as a witness of the 750 years old church history .
today maintain Horst K@@ all@@ en@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em of the &quot; Schaff@@ ner Rent@@ ers &quot; as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn the Hil@@ arius system .
as an organis@@ er , the friends and Patr@@ ons invite the tum@@ ult on Sunday , 16 July , at the sixth Ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery to the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
this is designed by the com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gym@@ dial@@ ums Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with contributions from Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Matt@@ eis .

association aims to check the approval of Wind@@ bikes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not a legal condition for the construction and therefore has transformed into the council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been hon@@ ored &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hat Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) are promp@@ ted to increase its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is illegal .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 at Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved since at the time in Vi@@ ers@@ en only on the border to Schwal@@ m@@ tal a Wind@@ force of Con@@ centr@@ ation zone .
within this concentr@@ ations , construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible , at the same time , the Con@@ centr@@ ation zone acts to the exclusion of wind use for the rest of the city .
in many zones should be a &quot; re@@ par@@ ation &quot; of the landscape .
the city of Vi@@ ers@@ en had a few days before a change of the flo@@ od spring in the bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - who had not approved the district government Düsseldorf in Düsseldorf , because of a phrase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the lack of plan@@ ing legal requirement is the dis@@ advant@@ ageous permits , as against illegal , &quot; said Christoph Erk@@ ens , president of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current status of things : the city entered the wind ceas@@ ef@@ ire in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; a permit of the District Government is still made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Erk@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the issu@@ ing of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines according to the law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the challenge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter have been lod@@ ged from the circle of Vi@@ ers@@ en &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explained a speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle is taking it for the occasion to consider the matter again .
but they are expected to do not assume that the procedure is stopped .
with a view of running procedures at the Board of Directors , the circle on Thursday does not intend to refer to the line of the &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW re , an affiliate of NEW , is planning on an area at the bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette the construction of four each 200 metres high wind@@ bikes .
already in the past year , the company had involved in which the city of Vi@@ ers@@ en is involved , past@@ el agreements with the owner of about 65 hectares of great money .
with establishment of the four wind turbines , the power requirement is to be covered by around 11 400 households - this corresponds to some five thousand households of all Vi@@ ers@@ ener households .
the NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros .
last summer saw Vi@@ ers@@ ens city entered green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Wind@@ park Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen , as well as a stake in a wind turbines in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the Circle Hein@@ sberg .

also attractive offers on Saturday and calcium @-@ fees on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer needs to be new or closed again .
this includes courses and tourists .
but many locals could have lost the city center at shopping out of view .
at the end , all of them would have to contribute to the city &apos;s downtown - to the landl@@ ords , the factories of the whole city and associations .
it used to overcome with a network the Le@@ th@@ ar@@ gie who made some broad@@ casting , king had said in spring .
Bir@@ git St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK Center in Mühl@@ hausen , shared with that at the nation@@ wide third &quot; home @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; Day , the first five Th@@ ur@@ in@@ gia Cities .

Tr@@ ump sat down after sear@@ ched trans@@ cription from telephone call Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
call for trans@@ cription by telephone call from US @-@ President Donald Tr@@ ump and leader of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January 2009 Tr@@ ump in a telephone call with the Mexican presidency En@@ rique P@@ ena NI@@ E@@ TO , to be heard , publicly , to say that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
the U.S. president de@@ imp@@ ly him because he had publicly announced the wall in the Berlin . report said he said to him , &quot; this can not say the press . &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to establish a wall in the southern border of the USA and sw@@ elling , Mexico for the project .
trans@@ cription his first call for his first call with the au@@ str@@ al@@ ischen Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m turn@@ tables were also published and enth@@ used a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ a said that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia , &quot; ri@@ dic@@ ulous &quot; and &quot; du@@ mb , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; du@@ ck , &quot; after having proposed him like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after having proposed a ban on the rel@@ ocation of refugees in the United States .
Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after having said Mr. Turn@@ a , &quot; that is the uncomfortable calls for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ores Ford @-@ Mass@@ ac@@ re : activ@@ ists perform r@@ ass@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury went through a group of vie@@ wers in the rural Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and walked in the Ford @-@ bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before making the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had to reach the bridge , a group of white men joined in order to block its path .
the leader of the bul@@ b - a man middle aged in a con@@ i@@ fer@@ ment tank - took a long train at his c@@ ig@@ ar and bli@@ cked by the wind@@ shield .
inside @-@ web@@ ten the In@@ s@@ assen in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; bro@@ w the man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ ening the silence , as a young black @-@ black man of the passenger cr@@ ash .
fortunately this hor@@ ri@@ ble scene is played , which was played on 22 July , only a post@@ al .
but if then a s@@ ails around the neck of &quot; Roger &quot; was cast , almost all in the audience is very true s@@ igh .
since 2005 Ci@@ tiz@@ ers of the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge returned to the night in the two black pairs - Roger and Dor@@ oth@@ y Mal@@ com , as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Kl@@ ux Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one has ever been cl@@ oned because of the mor@@ de .
&quot; it is truly in@@ concei@@ vable that in all these years , no one person was arrested in all these years , even though we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks that helps in the organisation of post .
&quot; it is a dirt drain on a history , but it is a burden to our souls . &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year former Congress of Georgia and a lifetime of civil society .
for him it serves as a neutral call to action and represents an annual memory of the mon@@ ro@@ e community that an Un@@ law has never been corrected .
&quot; we want to be prosec@@ ution , we want to end , we want healing , we want to re@@ conciliation , but first we must get righteousness , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot come to healing and re@@ conciliation , until we can get justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a def@@ ender , a du@@ el on the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ru@@ de on 27 July 1946 .
according to F@@ BI , which have been obtained from the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding engra@@ ving in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process of sus@@ pic@@ ious .
but none has ever been indic@@ ted .
although the susp@@ ects have been on free foot for decades , ci@@ tiz@@ ens@@ hip that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch @-@ actions in the whole town was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , passed a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice of the black citizens in Georgia for the first time , in the summer of fighting their voice .
about at the same time as choosing the F@@ BI of the black Far@@ mp@@ ter Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a battle - supp@@ os@@ edly because of a woman .
Bro@@ oks said that h@@ ester came in the city that h@@ ester came with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ oth@@ y and that the baby who carried it , not by her husband .
on 25 July 1946 paid lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owners , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the F@@ BI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ oth@@ y and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when they are distant from the prison , and the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge leads to a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b the car .
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison , which has prepared the Mor@@ de and arranged , from an F@@ BI @-@ report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there has been a sc@@ rap between state and local criminal prosec@@ ution , which was not only involved in the murder , evidence remo@@ ves and identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bro@@ oks formulated it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an elect@@ oral mass@@ ac@@ re &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register , and if you vote , then you will happen here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost a decade , C@@ ass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual closure of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
your presentation is vi@@ vi@@ dly , erg@@ ently and is established in a kind of deep@@ en rac@@ ism , that many believe it does not exist in America .
it &apos;s hard to look , and even more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ c because we are confronted with his ug@@ ly in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot build relationship with you if you do not want to listen or hear , what I have made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the samples for this year @-@ year production began in June , and on the first day of almost 30 actors - a do@@ zen feminine and the rest Black - in a room and lau@@ re@@ ited as Gre@@ ene a well @-@ coordinated overview of the play started .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ g@@ h here is here Gre@@ an Co @-@ director .
he has played the role of Chief C@@ lan@@ mit@@ gli@@ eds for years , but he said , the role will never become easier .
&quot; I feel dirty because I am not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ g@@ h .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it is very important to keep this history alive because we would not want to return to those times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and N@@ ick Ras@@ cona , the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester play its lines .
the play begins with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester an@@ sch@@ eit and him burning , w@@ aver@@ ing that he has slept with his wife Dor@@ oth@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n --- he , mer@@ ged from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ cona ow@@ dered the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) in laugh@@ ter .
Gre@@ ene te@@ ens at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what ? ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ras@@ cona . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is al@@ armed and conf@@ used .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still ki@@ ch@@ alling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t believe that white people back then &apos; n --- he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but , &quot; funny one of the other black performers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you just have the hard &apos; R. &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is precisely there the energy in space , a feeling of camera re@@ places replaced the un@@ pleas@@ ant@@ ness .
everyone is busy this correctly to get correctly not only because of the game but also because of the memory of the four gri@@ pping people .
the scene will start once again .
this time , when law@@ ns says the N @-@ word he says it is sharp and with a re@@ print .
absolutely no one l@@ acht .
this re@@ petition ends violent and fast .
there is write , shots and then silence .
a woman , with a dream @-@ dress is dres@@ sed above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and guides Bil@@ lie Holidays trau@@ ern@@ al lob@@ ster &quot; St@@ range fruit . &quot;
your voice breaks from every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four do@@ zen spar@@ es swe@@ at and t@@ ears from the eyes .
the audience is almost syn@@ onymous between Black and White .
one pair is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , enriched to see the performance , many come only down the street .
they have experienced every nearly eight hours of the Georgi@@ an humidity when Bro@@ oks it leads on a pilgri@@ mage to the tr@@ aders of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ sec@@ ys .
until this point the mor@@ de have stayed a a@@ ne@@ k@@ d@@ ote but now , if one stands on the same country , where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de place , feels the air driven table .
if the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites you to insp@@ ecting the quantity one , closer and the cor@@ pse is insp@@ ecting .
children ho@@ cken to their minds , sign the f@@ ake blood and the bre@@ ast@@ feeding body and fl@@ ang@@ ing each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mur@@ ders a little boy , when he wants to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes , Gre@@ ene of the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actor throw the Lyn@@ chs@@ eil away and angr@@ y their t@@ ears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ g@@ h , the man in the Andes , which has played the C@@ lan@@ ade .
N@@ ick Ras@@ cona embr@@ aces two of its fellow @-@ players and then break into their arms , the emotional load of the insur@@ er breaks finally through him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whis@@ pers one of the women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done this for a reason . &quot;
later the audience continue with the actors for dinner together .
at a table , a white pair of Atlanta enriched over the after@@ words with a black pair which they have just discussed .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski batt@@ ens to find words to find words , which feeling the ab@@ duction has left .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear this terrible words and deeds ... to come to people who look like yourself and they do that because they look like you , &quot; said it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me , makes me believe that the Lyn@@ chen still continues to go , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , it is called the police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the audience have not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it also has an understanding of its view .
I draw a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
max amount is working as a volunteer
they work in their volunteer year at several locations .
where everywhere ?
quantity : usually at Stein@@ furt in furniture , once a week in Gre@@ ven in the furniture Bridge .
and I also worked in open full day on the school .
what are your experiences with that ?
quantity : it is a nice , wide spectrum which I see here .
I have to do with various people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
you are now 26 years , thus another of career volunteer .
how does it happen ?
quantity : I made Ab@@ it@@ ur .
and then a buil@@ ders studies , we say it , successfully ab@@ broken .
I have recognized for me that it is meant for me and I want to do something else , with people .
and then I asked me what is doing .
M@@ ach a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is spot , in the burning point perhaps also , really is .
and was it so ?
quantity : I have collected great impressions .
I will run my studies in the winter semester .
I will not study , probably in the Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t H@@ erne a social work training and studies in Ham@@ m at Fach@@ hoch@@ schule .
is it not something unusual , during the volunteer services have several different applications to have ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it probably always comes to where you can be FS@@ J .
you can make it from Al@@ ter@@ sheim to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the after@@ no@@ ons .
for me that was exactly the stra@@ ighten@@ ed that I saw .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it truly is going on .
other than in the construction @-@ engineering studies ?
quantity : well clearly , here it is not about to settle St@@ ati@@ ken .
one has always another person in front of the head , which have a completely different story behind you .
whether a refuge@@ e occurs whether a youth , who has been fet@@ ched from the family - you have always must be individually aimed at all of this .
very interesting .
and you had no connection of touch ?
quantity : therefore I am not the guy .
there is an area that gives a lot .
great love , lots of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but that is life itself .

E@@ PA returns decision to del@@ aying the smo@@ g @-@ rule after l@@ acks
the U.S. American Environmental Protection Authority has a decision to delay a regulation of the government of Obama susp@@ ended , won@@ ach the states are obliged to convert the smo@@ g @-@ caused emissions to cast . this took place a day after 15 states pro@@ claimed the agency due to the stri@@ c@@ ited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the E@@ PA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the &quot; O@@ zon@@ ator 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said , they show the obligation of the agency , working with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and in mind that we react on our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ PA @-@ Chef Scott Pru@@ itt in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pru@@ itt announced in June the intention of E@@ PA announced the O@@ zon@@ ement in which to be measured in a part of the country contam@@ inated emissions in which in a part of the country &apos;s contam@@ inated emissions should be taken to hold str@@ ing@@ ent air standards - in order to delay a year up to October 2018 .
a group of 15 largely democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , travel@@ ed on Tuesday k@@ gs and said that the effort is illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried a wide range of environmental defe@@ ats , which has risen the former President Barack Obama , as part of a wider agenda , which should stimulate the economic growth to t@@ oss the economic growth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the efforts have triggered the rel@@ apse of the Democratic and reserves , which are worried about the impact of larger emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the website of E@@ PA is telling that the breathing of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; the lung function , and can reinforce the breathing symptoms , such as as@@ thma .
municipalities wants common space
in the end , the decision was clearly : in two contr@@ asts , the municipal council of Flu@@ orn @-@ winds , the establishment of a common smoking shop in the future senior residence .
in front of the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still missing piece of steep was signed , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although it will still take until the so far the church st@@ em@@ in@@ de belong@@ ed to the common area in the common areas , but there is now no planning phase for that from a private invest@@ or to st@@ em@@ men@@ au project .
there is a discussion concerning a common smoking .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat , offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor it would provide a living area - around 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a maximum of 70 square meters of space for a special price .
the administration and majority of the municipal web site , such a common room cannot be considered as a meeting place for the residents of the sen@@ ior@@ champion , but openly in the community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as example made the word of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stri@@ e@@ café &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision is made by providing funds for running funds for the ongoing budget already in the last autumn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the construction is located in the refurb@@ ishment area .
the establishment of a shared space would be , so reported T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent .
the qu@@ or@@ pre@@ cip@@ itation will see to sign@@ aling him in this respect no bill@@ et between the legs , the finding that both Saddle - - what was reduced in the environment - - as well as P@@ ult@@ on - which would be reduced and the construction of economic power - I would be possible .
un@@ necessary , so do not only mean Wil@@ fried So@@ h@@ mer , be this promise .
if &apos;s helps : un@@ anim@@ ous he happens the body .
not so easy goes to the common room .
Daniela Call refers to the many own buildings , with which you are not going to go right now , for sure you are now at the common room out of the window , says it : &quot; I do so hard to deal with it . &quot;
Y@@ v@@ onne &apos;s state is imper@@ ative for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it provides behind it a ver@@ t sub@@ mitt@@ ent sub@@ contrac@@ tors , or even foreign investors .
that is just not so , because with the acquisition of the area you do not give a subsi@@ dy , but get a real , in the doubt medi@@ ation , is the counter@@ part .
Sta@@ ig@@ ers request , the qu@@ int@@ ment according to the resolution , there are three fears .
so it remains in two contr@@ asts during the original program , Stefan H@@ aller so together : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we set the resolution , we make a Ries@@ ling to close a Ries@@ cher in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

walk in the Har@@ z of Stern to Stern
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Har@@ z the nation is supposed to be the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star@@ n@@ erst@@ ad &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is planning the association observ@@ atory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
a plan@@ etary way there is in Göt@@ t@@ ingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come to the information of many Har@@ z@@ visit , was called it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he connector nature , science , movement and sport@@ y performance .
members want to set up the planned route along the planned route and inform about stars and star pictures .
in a first phase until 2018 planning the association &quot; well achiev@@ able installations to five to six places &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z .
in@@ ask k@@ ä@@ men St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber .
the information on the boards should be added by the Internet .
therefore plays a role in the sit@@ ing and a good mobile network @-@ reception .
also accessibility is a crit@@ erion .
later the star should be enlarged by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the star@@ ring path , the vie@@ wers will learn a lot of knowledge , e.g. about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition they educ@@ ate why stars would have different colors or why a star loved lumin@@ aire than another , although it is much further away .
convey@@ s also , in which con@@ stell@@ ation have a selected star , and when it is best to be seen .
the association has been operating since 2014 in the Berg@@ städ@@ t@@ chen St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest located in Northern Israel .
the location in the middle of the National Park of Har@@ z is one of the Federal Ministry for Nature Conservation at the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
frequently from there from the galaxy and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galaxy with a mere eye can clearly see .
in the Un@@ i @-@ Stadt , there has been an initiative of the plan@@ etary Planet@@ arium Göt@@ t@@ ingen somewhat simil@@ arity like the planned star @-@ wer@@ g - the plan@@ etary path .
starting from Geb@@ h@@ ards hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ all@@ ee which forms the interior of our solar system , leads the planet path with its steel up to Hain@@ berg , and to the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extra @-@ ter@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality ben@@ ches ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the St@@ els with the individual planets - including the Zwer@@ g@@ plan@@ ed de@@ gra@@ ving Pl@@ uto at the end - are exactly the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth sch@@ r@@ ump@@ ed so on a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters , while the exact 75 meters are within 70 cen@@ tim@@ eters .
the entire distance of the planet is a good four kilometers .
while the light takes about eight hours to Pl@@ uto you need a good hour to the St@@ ele with Pl@@ uto .
pedest@@ ri@@ ans are thus faster than the light in the world .
the march to the next fix@@ ing , but would still take a half year .

four con@@ fin@@ ed after tire @-@ space
for an accident on the A7 , on Thursday afternoon four people were in part difficult .
after the first information , the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira , against 16.@@ 30 , shortly before the junction Market , probably after a tire space to take control of his vehicle .
the truck lo@@ wer@@ ed to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he sm@@ ote himself and then remained on the roof of the thir@@ sty .
the four In@@ s@@ ors - two adults and two children - were heavily hurt in the accident .
during the first time the first supply of the last through the lif@@ ebo@@ at service was susp@@ ended the A7 towards north for around an hour , then the traffic on the left margin should be investigated .
advanced Hoffmann : &quot; Tri@@ erk@@ ette works better &quot;
And@@ re Hoffmann hopes for the 2 : 2 to the season over@@ hau@@ l against Braunschweig , that the optimization of def@@ ences in Au@@ e points brings .
with the first season , And@@ re Hoffmann was satisfied , with the result also , would not have been the two op@@ ore at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two op@@ edi@@ ore too much , and we must fit even better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ ences of Fortuna Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains , the tri@@ ck can also be optimized even further .
and a gate after a fre@@ ash , the Fort@@ ress want to be no more common .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be so no more next to Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his crew also comes to better immediately after experiences in the preparation with the tri@@ erk@@ ats , as with the qu@@ erk@@ ats .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how we can act in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says his coach Fried@@ hel@@ m Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is itself in the triangle on the semi @-@ positions on the semi @-@ compositions in KA@@ AN Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko lad@@ el@@ mann players who can build well , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the requirement is , but that we are still better harmon@@ ize , and we do not afford to play as many de@@ roll . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course also take Hoffmann to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if one cannot speak after a mis@@ ery start , I do not know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance could indeed be okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we can concentrate on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the poker tournaments , we will certainly be able to speak of a decent sauna . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of it wanted to know his coach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start in the season began only six to eight rounds , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fried@@ hel@@ m Funk@@ el who didn &apos;t want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e only because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be pre@@ matur@@ ely because of an un@@ w@@ at home . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now you can start the season quasi with a hom@@ e@@ play , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann believes that players from Au@@ e may even be somewhat fres@@ her , since they had no heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an asc@@ ended cal@@ ories in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but they do not know so 100 @-@ percentage where they are currently standing , &quot; says the defence of the Fortuna .
while the guests from the Rhin@@ eland and more easily Favor@@ it on Sunday in the encounter in the last ( almost ) manufacture st@@ adium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we move away , just because we have the claim to come under the first six@@ es , Bl@@ ö@@ d@@ ness &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose record was absolutely positive with only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ l@@ iga , which one must hit by pres@@ tige , &quot; explains Fort@@ unas Ch@@ ef@@ coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a such statement would meet arro@@ gan@@ t and over@@ crowded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so Funk@@ el wants to experience his players on Sunday on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum seek@@ ers released
the latest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which were subj@@ ected to a new method for the medical assessment of their age groups , that more than 80 per cent of the shared persons older than 18 years are . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authority for For@@ ensi@@ c medicine ( R@@ ätt@@ sm@@ edic@@ ine ) has started the implementation of the test last year .
they are supposed to be more accurately during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish migration Auth@@ orities ( mig@@ rat@@ ors em@@ body ) due to errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees was cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed that the min@@ ced year .
until today , migration period has ma@@ iled 6,@@ 880 to test@@ ament and the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency has now released the results from a total of 2,@@ 481 tests from the period from mid March to 31 July 2017 .
forty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency will be proj@@ ected that the person &quot; may be 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 432 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; possibly under 18 years old is &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests will only be conducted in cases where the age of the person is ques@@ tioned .
according to Joh@@ an Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency , the results in recent months are being stable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no big difference in statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the magazine The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases reported in which the person has been assessed as over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has suffered over his age .
in May the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there will be 442 cases to suggest that the oppressed person 18 years or older . &quot;
as the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bl@@ a@@ det , the 581 published results published , she asked that in 243 of these cases the person had told the person that she will be in this year 18 years old .
the method of medical age evaluation , in the r@@ ön@@ land of white @-@ teeth and M@@ RT recording of knee injury are analy@@ sed , which was analy@@ zed by dentists and Radi@@ ologists , was also cri@@ ti@@ zed in some areas .
an Sk@@ ep@@ tics is the end@@ oc@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute , whose work covers the assessment of biological fri@@ es of people to see if it sooner or later went through pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about this , and I don &apos;t believe that the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to assess the biological age in this manner is very uns@@ ure .
if we cannot say it sure we should not do as if we could it , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro .
Gö@@ ran@@ sson from For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency def@@ ended however the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general you can tell you that the risk , a child is un@@ correct to judge , low is minor .
the biggest risk is in fact when the person is just under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are well forward .
on Wednesday , a seven tons of sword was installed at the bridge on the eastern part of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold lad@@ der , leader in the Department of road and traffic in the Res@@ cue of Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April the work started at all three re@@ mod@@ est bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the construction is planned for October and is certain that the schedule is respected .
the first bridge , from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads to the tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ aul@@ ted bridge from concrete , who is dres@@ sed with rot@@ em b@@ unt@@ stein and has a total length of 4,80 meters .
she was built in 1900 .
as the two other bridges , she has now come into the years now .
to ensure the stability and road safety , the three buildings are now re@@ constructed thoroughly .
the two other bridges lead to the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
you are made of red b@@ unt@@ a .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , and are twelve metres long .
the bridge on the outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach now has received a 1,30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called Br@@ ück@@ ters .
this is a random , which is also used as operation .
at the southern part of the bridge is to be used on Friday a 2,20 meters wide bree@@ ders .
it should leave the pedestrian road .
the particular thing is that it is a pre@@ judi@@ ces , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger Company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges is already provided with the pat@@ ented Br@@ ück@@ ters .
special fing@@ erti@@ ps has the embarrass@@ ed of lines through the construction work in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
for there a glass of fi@@ bers are also connected to which many companies are connected .
the inhabitants were informed in advance of the works by hand@@ z@@ ett@@ les on the project .
moreover , first fish and canc@@ ers had to be de@@ plet@@ ed .
for the bridges between the building buildings and the Con@@ fir@@ es in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic lights .
for construction work on the bridge on the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher outskirts , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; T@@ ann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; fully susp@@ ended .
the cost of the three Br@@ ück@@ els are currently around 700 000 Euro .
the whole is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under prot@@ est at German Pot@@ oc@@ al@@ at
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not so often that parties go to a stran@@ ger , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , what else is difficult to bring under a hat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
die im Krei@@ stag Vol@@ cano dep@@ uty parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , F@@ WG , F@@ WG , Lin@@ ke ) belong to a broad coalition which shows on this day of peaceful flag because the Af@@ D is in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle R@@ ond@@ ell to the loud Poster of the huge election campaign .
and known names on the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land the top du@@ o for the Bundestag on 24 September , and the dep@@ uty federal government of Stor@@ k .
but those who are already two hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ gh@@ ers , but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
originally the city was planned with the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; at the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now takes place in the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and therefore directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ gh@@ an event in the Stadthalle .
a colorful picture that offers itself here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , president of the forum A world and one of the relevant organiz@@ ers , really are looking forward : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great how many people came here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are music and plenty of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German pot@@ ato &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which could eat the Af@@ D without problems &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police has conducted many officials from Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence primarily on the train station , which is only a few meters away from the venues .
how is the Af@@ D emerged on Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes told by the Af@@ gh@@ os@@ ei@@ fel , he has made an event dedicated to such an event and the surcharge .
the 45 @-@ year from G@@ ön@@ n@@ ers@@ dorf had first asked first in Dau@@ n there , but there had been an ab@@ sage because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes , not enough parking available .
so , the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; overlooking the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , great matter , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also does it : against 20 o &apos;clock in the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle various speakers , including the rh@@ einf@@ o @-@ pf@@ alz Af@@ D @-@ Chair Uwe Young .
in the hall are about 200 list@@ eners to wait that the top of the top of the Bundestag , Alice Wei@@ del , and the dep@@ uty Bundes@@ vor@@ sitz@@ ende Be@@ at@@ rix from Stor@@ k to keep their speeches .
unchanged is the police representative , but so far they had a quiet evening .
somewhat more than one hour takes the Af@@ D event , the guests on the court have a longer breath , but also there is short to 21 watch .
police can decor@@ ate the police - no special prec@@ au@@ tions .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people love gr@@ illed cheese and will eat him until the end of their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I would like to try all out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thr@@ illing Ste@@ wart very open about their bis@@ ex@@ ual . &quot; &quot; &quot;

I only never liked it to be taken seriously . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a trainer I would say that it is time to play a different game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump appeared before a great announcement in the West Virginia R@@ ally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice endor@@ sed the democratic candidate in Hill@@ ary Clinton .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 Govern@@ ors and the control of the least legislative activities in history is the announcement of Govern@@ or Justice only the last rejection of a party that is from above to below without leadership and is not able to find a positive that &apos;s message &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ chair R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation the CB@@ S News . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the global leader of the athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , pra@@ ised on Thursday , which he used as a off@@ und@@ ing dischar@@ ge from Russia to a doping sc@@ andal , but he re@@ peti@@ te , it is not the moment for the country to be back in sports .
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics leader D@@ mit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ac@@ ht@@ in said during the IAAF World Congress on the eve of the Lei@@ cht@@ athle@@ tik @-@ World Championships that was correct from the sport correctly and that he decided to fight the doping .
he said , it is sorry for &quot; all athletes , to those in competitions Gold@@ - and Silver med@@ a@@ og@@ gles have been car@@ ved . &quot;
in spite of his comments , the IAAF World Congress for the maintenance of the associations , which in November 2015 depends on a report of the World @-@ Anti @-@ doping agency ( WA@@ DA ) notes on state @-@ funded doping in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was today a very open response , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said @-@ President Co@@ e the Rep@@ or@@ tern &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has experienced in itself , that they have already experienced quite my name and everything possible to ensure that the Federation will be re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Co@@ e said , he was also &quot; delighted &quot; that Russia accept the criteria for his re @-@ introduction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been achieved , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to do everything in the next few months to normal@@ ise this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the principle of principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean@@ se athletes from the dep@@ ra@@ ved system , he added
nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes will begin with the Lei@@ cht@@ athle@@ tik World Championships that begin on Friday in London after the strict IAAF criteria as a neutral actors .
the director of the IAAF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia still meet some of the criteria for re@@ peti@@ tions .
Dro@@ gent@@ ests are still in@@ adequate and remaining trainers are still free , he said Rep@@ or@@ tern in London after a talk at the IAAF Council .

how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can the consumer protect themselves .
agricultural machinery Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is given an interview and answer in the interview with the editors network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Mr. Schmidt , How can the consumer protect themselves from po@@ ison@@ ed proteins ?
I can only encourage all consumer consumer and consumers , to look at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp .
in the consumer of the consumer portal www.@@ Lebensmittel@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the provinces has provided the latest information on the affected Eg@@ gs .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if after all we currently know , a health haz@@ ard is practically excluded .
now Al@@ di is now taking over the best possible crisis response - all eggs hat@@ red from the offer - because the central role of the insur@@ rection is not really perceived ?
food monitoring is the task of the provinces .
nevertheless , my house has out@@ dated my house and is in return , the suff@@ erers of Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries .
all the information and risk assessment shall be stored for consumers .
the trade has just as the manufacturer to worry that the selling products traffic and health is un@@ question@@ able .
if at Ei@@ ke of the rear @-@ content of 0,@@ 00@@ 5mg / kg is exc@@ eeded , they are not able .
however , un@@ loaded eggs may be sold and te@@ aches .
this time is not the farms to blame .
are manufacturing companies and consumers in the same boat ?
after time knowledge , the production facility takes no immediate fault .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather , they must count on illegal practices of services and commercial practices . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as always there is in the seri@@ ousness of little check@@ ers .
is missing only on the staff or on the key jurisdiction ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were just the am@@ eful controls that have revealed the process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the truth is also that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded at 100 per cent .
this is therefore a consistent clari@@ fication of such events and the hand@@ over to the Prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases of which pen@@ alties are of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made several times clear that I expect the competent authorities to receive a seam@@ less education . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the regular al@@ ar@@ mis@@ m in food production really necessary ?
consumer consumers and consumers have the right to ensure safe and traffic food .
if a non @-@ approved ins@@ ecti@@ ci@@ de in the food industry is being used to consumer consumer and consumers .
due to the p@@ ans@@ ing means manufacturer , dealers and consumers have come into a situation which is absolutely not necessary .
basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of the ins@@ ecti@@ ci@@ de Fi@@ pr@@ oni@@ l in the attitude of life @-@ center is not h@@ inn@@ ed and must be termin@@ ated immediately .
it has to be consistently working on all levels and worked with high pressure .
I expect from all the competent authorities , that the atomic can be cleaned quickly and quickly clari@@ fied .
how the finance rules of Foot@@ ball on N@@ ey@@ mars moves to Paris
the rules that aim to avoid un@@ resolved issues of European foot@@ ball@@ ers , become N@@ ey@@ mars Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord @-@ Transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain not distur@@ bing .
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the U@@ EF@@ A , for the executive organization that the European game has monitored power , cre@@ ws of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair @-@ Play @-@ rules that was launched by the U@@ EF@@ A to live , mean that PSG some@@ time must be clari@@ fied that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar have been financed without great losses .
Barcelona has charged 222 million euros ( 262 million $ ) to purchase the bra@@ si@@ lien from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar is received a sal@@ ary that will be several 10 million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mars Mov@@ ing to France .
PSG can make money lo@@ cker , so that N@@ ey@@ mar is sub@@ mer@@ ed and bring it into a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team by the energy rich sover@@ eign family of Qatar .
you may have a lot of money for purchasing players a lot of money , but with legiti@@ mate sources , which enable them to give them the break @-@ even point in their own football business .
FF@@ P was conceived by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the U@@ EF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French players believed that associations have taken enormous debt to their quest for success , effectively ent@@ ru@@ sted and ris@@ ky to ruin if banks or owners returned their support .
in 2011 FF@@ P lost FF@@ P from concentration on the debts of the clubs on the monitoring of their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the novel A@@ br@@ amo@@ vi@@ ch was originally used in Chelsea - a club with potential and then powerful invested in order to enhance the crew and build a global brand - to be a t@@ oug@@ her aff@@ air .
during the current three year @-@ year @-@ year period , which runs through 2018 , clubs can accept losses in the amount of 30 million euros .
and although Plat@@ ini is fallen from the presidency into in@@ gn@@ ade , his U@@ EF@@ A successor Al@@ ek@@ s@@ ander C@@ ass@@ ing will continue to be dis@@ proportion@@ ate to them , of excessive expenses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certainly is FF@@ P not dead and we will reinforce the rules for the future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so that at U@@ EF@@ A for FF@@ P is responsible to The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PSG buy @-@ out @-@ cl@@ ause of N@@ ey@@ mar has paid in a package , it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of his contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the distr@@ action for the next five years can be transferred to an annual amount of 44,@@ 4 million euros in the annual closure .
the first wave of FF@@ P @-@ sanctions in 2014 has hit the PSG along with Abu Dhabi which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .
the PSG ProntoSIL CN of 60 million euros ( at that 82 million dollars ) , which was later arranged on 20 million euros , and it was arranged that the teams members for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 on 21 players will take place normal 25 players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the U@@ EF@@ A is in search of Kl@@ ubs , which could try to super@@ vise their financial outlook by providing their income by companies that are connected with the owners of a club .
while a Catalan company could not exceed the value of sponsor@@ ship the standard market rates , the U@@ EF@@ A would not be regarded as leg@@ i@@ times income .
exactly this happened in 2014 , when the U@@ EF@@ A decided that the value of sponsor@@ ship of PS@@ A was introduced by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a part of the PSG payments to N@@ ey@@ mar on payments of the organizer of the World Cup 2022 could come in Qatar .
but PSG and Kat@@ ar 2022 have suffered that N@@ ey@@ mar World Cup will be easy to figure out and a such man@@ eu@@ ver for the U@@ EF@@ A regulatory authorities could simply figure out .
the recent sanctions against PSG ProntoSIL mean that the U@@ EF@@ A will still be attentive to consider the rules to handle the rules .
the U@@ EF@@ A had no pre@@ prepared talks with PSG ProntoSIL N@@ ey@@ mars Transfer , sag@@ ed on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they said among the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , as they were not entitled to discuss the PSG situation .
the latest published reports indicate that PSG 2015 / 16 with a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million euros has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year will have to be published .
PSG awaits that N@@ ey@@ mars arrive a bo@@ on for sponsor@@ ing @-@ De@@ als , merch@@ an@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ bal @-@ sales .
the association is assum@@ ing that the sales after signature at least 30 percent will rise off .
the Spanish League has been clearly ir@@ ri@@ fied , one of the best so@@ cc@@ er players go to see , and tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mars Weg@@ w by taking state that PSG will hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear fall of &quot; financial &quot; &quot; financial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the cl@@ ub and the state &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of La Liga , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily newspaper AS in terms of cat@@ ars and the official owner of PSG . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ar@@ senal manager Ar@@ s@@ ene W@@ enger , whose association is owned by an American sport @-@ ty@@ co@@ ons , the reservations of La Liga against a state which is financed by an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the owner and this has changed the whole landscape of the foot in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as a country has a club , is all possible .
it will respect very difficult to respect the financial Fair@@ play , because you can move different ways or have different interests when a country has such a major player to present a country . &quot;
Swiss is searching for a new Sch@@ og@@ gi@@ ants
in the past few years choc@@ ol@@ at Fre@@ y abo@@ ard chocolate for Swiss Life .
now it is working together in front of a possible conclusion : the airline writes the order new .
Swiss @-@ Spre@@ cher@@ in Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ r@@ ott confirmed on request of the presentation agency s@@ da a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; North@@ western Switzerland &quot; from Friday .
according to current planning , the airline will become a new contract for the first half of 2018 .
the products would have been reviewed every two to three years and moved to a quality control .
&quot; with the current supplier choc@@ ol@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; said the Spre@@ cher@@ in .
approximately 17 million small rot@@ white pack@@ aged boards about 14 grams are distributed per year to the passengers travelling to the passengers .

in industry , the order volume generated &quot; North@@ western Switzerland &quot; on 1.5 to 2 million Swiss fran@@ cs - the mig@@ ros @-@ daughter achieved an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss fran@@ cs .
but more important is all@@ em@@ al of the adver@@ ts , for an ac@@ og@@ ging producer it is a prestigious order .
how many applic@@ ants have on the new tender , does Swiss not want to betra@@ y .
but there are only Swiss manufacturers to question .
according to the report , choc@@ ol@@ at Fre@@ y wants to strive for a renewal of the contract over the spring of 2018 .
for the s@@ da the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturers was not able to reach an opinion .
Schokol@@ aden @-@ boards distributed the Swiss since 2006 on board of their flights .
before the Swiss a contract concluded with the mig@@ ros daughter , Barry Call@@ eb@@ aut had supplied in cooperation with H@@ ug the chocolate tablets .
the opportunity to place the logo introduced Swiss before two years ago with the start of cooperation with choc@@ ol@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works with different Swiss chocolate manufacturers .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; First Day of Camp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worked surprisingly good , not only because of its member state ( it contained an original story for a speaking of vegetables known by H. Jon Benjamin talking ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;

blow against drugs @-@ Maf@@ ia in the country
the police is a blow against the Italian Maf@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
at the middle of the morning , in the Black @-@ B@@ aar district , in R@@ ott@@ because , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart have developed numerous objects as the prosec@@ ution Con@@ stance on Friday .
at the age of between 25 years and 77 years were arrested and imprison@@ ed for those years ago .
in addition , the officials put larger quantities of mari@@ ju@@ ana and Kok@@ ain , pe@@ as , as well as several hundred thousand Euros safely .
the same swe@@ eps in Italy were arrested two people .
against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans there were German ar@@ rest warran@@ t .
the two are therefore probably delivered to Germany .
an action were Italian and Bay@@ erische Er@@ ror .
overall there were over 300 polic@@ emen in operation .
the members of the Maf@@ ia will be organised drugs , severe non@@ violence , bre@@ eder murder , as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail@@ ing .
even since summer 2016 , the prosec@@ ution Con@@ stance against organised drug trade in the South Africa .
between the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo is a real exchange and the investig@@ ator of Kri@@ po R@@ ott@@ because had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily .
therefore the wholes@@ ale revenue was accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
into the spot@@ light of the investigations , above all Italian nation@@ als with the related reference to the Italian Maf@@ ia .
also a pion@@ eer on 27 May in Hü@@ ls , which were shot by several shots in a host , is likely to go to the account of the gang .

the lead to some gra@@ vi@@ ating fail@@ ures in asylum procedure .
the Federal Commissioner for the refuge@@ e management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Way , has been given a media effect according to large g@@ aps in the Aus@@ län@@ der@@ zentr@@ al@@ register .
defects in the recorded data could lead in asylum procedure and deport@@ ations &quot; to some serious mis@@ decisions , in an analysis that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Southern German newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the register the information is estimated to ten million people with foreign nation@@ ality , including 5,@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data will be managed according to about 600 Aus@@ län@@ der@@ ers in Germany .
because the data has not been maintained , be the data quality in parts of so far has not been well maintained .
in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; of people who have long been no longer alive , or of citizens who have become the German citizen ; and in the register are no longer able to emerge . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; faul@@ ty data , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is the report of the report &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the statistics of the U.@@ S@@ ample people , the EU citizens must not travel freely , who would not have to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but led to such a false state , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to a dist@@ or@@ ted debate on how to deal with extin@@ ction &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is called in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the federal government has clearly begun to send refuge@@ e families with children under 16 @-@ old children to return to Italy when they have arrived there .
this is emerging from an internal paper of the Federal Agency for Migration and refugees ( BA@@ MF ) , the &quot; New &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the paper it is called to , the BA@@ MF guides such procedures &quot; concerning families with children , except for inf@@ ants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper in reference to the difficult situation on site .
after the Dublin North agreement , the EU state is responsible for refugees from the EU .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if an immig@@ rant must go into another EU country , this state can withdraw him into the unity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the reason , the office is now : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the record capacity for families with min@@ ced children in Italy significantly increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy have taken for the recording and accommodation of families of guarantees .

the Bank of England will maintain interest rates at 0,25 %
the Bank of England is expected to be later well @-@ known that the interest rates remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the At@@ ten@@ uation of the inflation must have sub@@ du@@ ed over a rise to rise above .
the Bank of England has war@@ ned that the economic growth will be &quot; money &quot; stay , when they kept interest rates on family members in the middle of an increased pressure .
the political decision makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreements with 6 to 2 for keeping the interest rates on 0.25 % , whereby the weak economic growth has increased the support for an increase .
in its fourth annual closure , reduced the Bank of its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1,7 % and for 2018 on 1.6 % and war@@ ned that the pressure on the household income , whereby the inflation in fall is expected to rise at almost 3 % .
but they sign@@ alized that in the next few years they would be necessary to grow by the Bre@@ x@@ it sm@@ elled inflation and she said that the credit card could rise more than expected to rise to the financial markets .
the members also managed to withdraw a part of the M@@ amm@@ ut @-@ economic package , which was issued before a year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will be time for the financing plan to prepare for the financial plan for banks , although said that it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling .
minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank : &quot; in the central progn@@ osis of the M@@ PC remains weak , since the pressure on the re@@ alities of households will continue to be charged to consumption . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interest rates re@@ peti@@ te them that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain pen@@ dic@@ ation of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to reduce inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; greater greater &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than the markets expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
markets : the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the bank emphas@@ ised that the In@@ cre@@ ases &quot; is gradually &quot; limited &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the growth forecasts for this and next year will be proj@@ ected for growth and 1,7 % in May . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she has maintained its growth forecast on 1.8 % in 2018 .
the Po@@ unds fell after these messages on the dollar and the euro .
the po@@ und fell by 0.5 % on 1,@@ 31 US dollars and fell 0.4 % at 1.11 Euro .
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ appoint@@ ing growth pay the increasing expectations of a Zin@@ c regulation , and the GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months has risen to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to be expected in the third quarter at 0,3 % , although it is easy to recover from the bank at the end of the year .
the recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households , who are affected by a rising inflation and low inflation , since the shar@@ pen@@ ing first will become worse off before they will get better .
it added that monetary policy in the next few years can not prevent the income of income , &quot; but they added to the wages of the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy is also reinforced by increasing demand for British goods , which is attri@@ buted to the weak pounds , which is comp@@ lied with a portion of a lower consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision returns a year after lo@@ wering the interest rates on 0.25 % in the last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote which resulted in the sin@@ ks of the counter@@ part .
the Bank is estimated that it will likely take four years until this will be completely att@@ ained by the prices and the economy .
before the final jud@@ gement of the bank to the interest rates , the reputation was increased to a Zin@@ ment , since the inflation was put pressure on hard @-@ dependent households , whereby three policy makers in July have demanded an increase on 0.5 % .
inflation is dropped last month from 2.9 % in June on 2.6 % although the bank said that this was expected and will return in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said , the exc@@ eeding in relation to its aim of 2 % is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weak pounds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; given the short@@ est way of S@@ wap bodies , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive as the bor@@ der@@ ers lau@@ t@@ hard to shops and end the year in a positive way .
the market looks especially good for those who run the existing de@@ als and the new hyp@@ othe@@ ques , and many with toll free options and low bre@@ eds are becoming more popular . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday announced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by N@@ HS England @-@ Chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Br@@ igh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be able to follow the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October , before it will be introduced in whole England in April 2018 .
Pre@@ ex@@ posi@@ tional proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV infection , which are taken before sex to reduce the risk of an HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission in inf@@ ectious substances .
pre@@ p in front of intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such drugs may be taken every day or so two hours before the intercourse .
among those who are coming in question are pregnant or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV @-@ positive partners who have not been treated successfully .
in clinics the appropriate participants identified to agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have checked a partner whose HIV status is not being certified by anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment .
people who live in England and registered with a practi@@ tioner , can also register for possible participation in their local sex hospital .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for delivery of drugs during this week following an international competitive procurement .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by being collected by clinical co@@ ders as it is implemented in large scale , and implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to preventing HIV and over@@ take them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in which more than three decades lasting progress in dealing with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p if it is targeted to the need@@ y and endang@@ ered people , the possibility to change the English HIV @-@ epide@@ mic .
from September to people suffering from high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS financing , in order to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not with a partner is subject to improve many , many lives .
we would like to welcome this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , Pre @-@ CEO of Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ g@@ ins Trust , said : &quot; the priority now must now lie that the study is fast throughout the country and that no one who has left a risk for HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now as the pre@@ p @-@ test@@ medicine has been discovered , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ in@@ erti@@ fied people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Shar@@ on H@@ od@@ g@@ son , shadow @-@ health care in , said : &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcome to monthly promises and over@@ due implementation by government .
the evidence show how transform this drug as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can finish the transfer of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is done as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV infection , and that they contribute to the ter@@ mination of the spread of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the great life live : mezzanine and cle@@ vere designer tri@@ cks , these little Ear@@ ls Court Apartment transformed into a spacious home
jo@@ anne L@@ eig@@ h , a former bank with a passion for real estate , smaller in 2014 from a large house in K@@ nigh@@ ts@@ bridge to an Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne was not packed and sold their bags .
&quot; before , I lived with my ex in K@@ nigh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I sear@@ ched according to something that was comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and it had the same high ceil@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love myself in her and made an offer on this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first tour the 1,000 square was completely rebuilt .
originally a bedroom property with a w@@ acht@@ ing layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted Jo@@ anne storage space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceil@@ ings , large windows , lots of light .
this was my request , &quot; says it .
to this end , she participated the architecture and Design@@ studio Duck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from N@@ otting Hill , the 12.5 feet high ceil@@ ings and to create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the blank@@ et was not big enough to place two rooms on each other , allowing the architectural challenge to create a mezzanine in which one could stand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ fan had to think creative thinking about the presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; explains it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were over@@ stepp@@ ed together without that we had to leave us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not just about to build a simple platform , but the steel so that he had the right height for the function above or down . &quot;
this order allowed to place Er@@ fan , two rooms in full amount to each other - with a lot of additional dr@@ ama .
for the mezzanine over@@ looks a classic coupling window of retro@@ u@@ vi@@ us via the gl@@ am@@ our@@ ous housing .
Ges@@ pi@@ eg@@ elte Gold@@ ebel , Silber@@ ne acc@@ ents and Vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille illumination set the style for the program .
the use of sp@@ elling plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
on both ends a short cor@@ ridor is mir@@ r@@ ored to leave it longer .
in the kitchen feels the mir@@ r@@ ors like a window into another room .
at the entrance we offer space units for all the stock and j@@ ars of jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ am@@ our@@ ö@@ outer space can close the beauty of the living room the kitchen when it is not used .
possible kitchens are nothing new .
the Fe@@ atured of this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a little engineering art went into , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel reinforced M@@ DF .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is crucial , so when you move the door very easily slides . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the cle@@ ver@@ able use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to gain extra 16 m ² , an extra bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the basic space - or how your property is valued , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form shall enter a real estate ad and perform a calculation based on the floor size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they managed to enlarge the surface area simultaneously and at the same time to use high quality materials that will get to the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things that you are tou@@ ching and which therefore help , a emotional connection in a home &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you do not ad@@ orable you into the electric sockets into the walls .
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be distinguished by good design and elev@@ ated square met@@ ers. of something standard in something quite amazing .
in fact , as Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave this not .
brothers strug@@ gling for a 500 million US dollars
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family has founded the Dyn@@ asty in an examination because of one of the greatest real estate imperi@@ al Victori@@ an in the value of more than 500 million dollars .
the former Director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Foot@@ ball Club &apos;s football club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis , lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . this has brought him to the Supreme Court of Justice to clarify how their property and business shall be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp examination of the separation takes place at the Supreme Court of Justice .
along with her mother Anna possess the brothers 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars , accumul@@ ated since the family 1973 a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood , bought .
there the family West@@ co Je@@ ans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
this money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now includes offices in the city center , the development of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and M@@ t Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs .
after an agreement with her late father , Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; captain &quot; and the domin@@ ating personality &quot; in the family De Lu@@ tis - about two thirds of the company &apos;s name and Paul about one third .
a court acknowled@@ ges that this signi@@ fies that Col@@ in property is in the value of 316 million dollars and Paul worth 176 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul as a problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Col@@ in proposed record have left him with the left of what I held for the best objects , &quot; wrote on 2015 in a first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice was held on the last Friday .
the brothers are now fighting for control over the existing business - weigh@@ ed Col@@ in , as Paul maintains it out .
col@@ in ar@@ gues , this is not true , but th@@ rows Paul ahead , some pos@@ sessions of pro@@ fic@@ i@@ ent .
in an early Aff@@ id@@ av@@ it that was filed by Col@@ in , he says , he hope to present the dispute .
&quot; my Italian heritage is written that the family is the most important priority , he wrote .
the costs will rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ vi@@ ts , e @-@ mails and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and charter k@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading attorney , including All@@ an My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides .
Mrs De Lu@@ tis and her husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , the milk bars and Del@@ ik@@ at@@ ess@@ s from the late 1950 @-@ s , and in the early se@@ ven@@ ties a shop will be used in Br@@ uns@@ wick .
they used the security to buy the coll@@ ing@@ wood deck@@ chair , in which Col@@ in the first Je@@ ans@@ ing of the family opened .
Col@@ in says that he began West@@ co there when he was in the high school when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hop@@ ed to pass their ownership to their sons in 2012 .
&quot; Luigi said often to me that he never wanted to land the brothers before judgment , &quot; wrote them .
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of De Lu@@ tis company group , whereby Col@@ in claims that Mark when leaving the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars have been paid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark , says Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in has maintained very back , although he was a former AF@@ L leader member and after an biography of the year 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire of the best friend of the TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media took up with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their attor@@ neys contact .
only Col@@ in rep@@ lied by SMS to say &quot; I can truly say much &quot; because the case before the courts may be .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very sad , my brother Paul decided to compl@@ ain me and to take our sur@@ name through the dishes , &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mid @-@ 2016 wrote Col@@ in in a letter to the judgment , that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Father had not was@@ hed that Paul and I would have in our current dispute , &quot; he said , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our matter will be solved in the near future by the courts , &quot; wrote col@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ umps of new Stab@@ ef plans to restrict the media ab@@ st@@ in@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and are failed .
maybe John F. Kelly may actually do .
if so , he will be the first .
polic@@ tico reported that the new Stab@@ ef of the White House is planning to restrict the information flow to President Tr@@ ump - including the reports of the news media - in the hope to keep the boss on a moderate course .
here is a piece of Rep@@ or@@ ter Jos@@ h Daw@@ sey :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Stab@@ st@@ ef of the White House , introduced to his first working day with executive employee , he presented a main problem in President Donald Tr@@ ack@@ white house that he has rep@@ aired : bad information that entered into the hands of the president . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in letters - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ey &apos;s diagnosis makes sense , but others have attemp@@ ted to rot@@ ate tr@@ ump removal by placing its medi@@ endi@@ ces .
President Tr@@ umps relationship with television is now back - and now , where he is in the White House , his television sets is still strong .
&quot; if the did@@ at Tr@@ ump was toler@@ ated because of an un@@ fair coverage , it was productive to show him that he was a fair coverage of offices that were to convince , said the former election campaign , Sam Nun@@ berg in February towards Poli@@ tico .
Poli@@ tic@@ os Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; the key to keep t@@ rough Twitter @-@ hab@@ it under control , according to six former election campaign offic@@ ers in it to ensure that his personal media has a st@@ ful praise price . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ umps Twitter @-@ hab@@ it ever &quot; under control &quot; was ri@@ dic@@ ulous .
maybe these Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ be@@ am@@ ten something that we don &apos;t know that Tr@@ ack@@ et without their interventions had even more mut@@ ually exclusive .
we will probably never know something about the pro@@ gression , the ump has not been sent .
if he lost his staff for several times , trouble passing from him , then their efforts have been worthwhile .
but no one has to prevent it consistently that Tr@@ ump condu@@ it calls .
a part of the problem is that people in a white house that puts out of competing parties , always try to present their own agenda by creating a ump material that might help their views from the world .
polic@@ tico - entirely with this story - reported in May about the pre@@ ference of the consultants , the president of strategic reasons question@@ able information .
this was an example that was described by Rep@@ or@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tr@@ ump @-@ officials say that Tr@@ ump can react like a volcano on negative press zones , especially such with cor@@ rupt le@@ aks and that it origin@@ ate from that it origin@@ ate .
exactly this happened at the end of February , when a man tri@@ umph a printed copy of an article of Got@@ ok@@ .com , the website of the Internet @-@ Prov@@ ok@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , the dep@@ uty manager of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh ul@@ dig@@ te , &quot; the source behind a bunch of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson have been b@@ anned from Twitter or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced wrong evidence in the past , and that he rec@@ alled wrong in the past .
Tr@@ ump las the article and started to ask for staff about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
gold @-@ maker added that the then St@@ able St@@ ef Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; have tried to manage a system to manage the pap@@ er@@ ram and to document the Tr@@ ump . &quot;
how has the worked ?
Kelly tries to do three months later , to do the same .
perhaps it will prove more effective and more effective manager as a Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ se self , and his advis@@ ors still strive for influence .
these in@@ variable factors make wa@@ it@@ ys mission very difficult .
Master Un@@ ri@@ bb@@ ons get Post by Euro@@ pol
as the address is unknown , the ten@@ se of the population will pray and hop@@ ed .
the police throughout Europe were ma@@ iled this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards to dangerous crime on the escape .
since the addresses of the retri@@ eval we@@ ed nature is not known to be announced , hints of the population hop@@ ed and pray .
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action that follows the &quot; EU Most W@@ anted &quot; -@@ Adv@@ ent@@ s. from winter .
the experiences would have shown that many of the people were still ri@@ pped at the point of Euro@@ pol .
I have compiled 21 post@@ cards for a criminal crus@@ her from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 there has been www@@ .e@@ um@@ ost@@ ter since 2016 , more than 2.5 million times this was considered .
36 of the online g@@ orges could already be arrested , at least eleven of them due to follow @-@ up after the publication on the website .
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; milli@@ on@@ ary series &apos;
some of the most prosp@@ erous hou@@ se@@ owner of the West Mid@@ lands are back again with some de@@ duc@@ tory travelers to war@@ fare , who have negoti@@ ated one of the municipality drawn down , to return a field in front of their man@@ sions .
the travelers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside of an aff@@ lu@@ ent road from Soli@@ hull hull type , which is called &quot; milli@@ on@@ ary series . &quot;
they have horses , babies and an army of tran@@ sports , after they were cancelled only in May , without being shi@@ fted by any of the Council to prevent its Con@@ ferences .
the tac@@ tical group found a gap in the def@@ enses and oppressed their vehicles through one section that remained un@@ disabled to find a way .
angr@@ y people have att@@ ained the advice of Soli@@ hull hull , the said that it is &quot; us@@ eless be to deal with the problem . &quot;
an anonymous inhabitants said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have moved on the assembly after they were sent by Bentley He@@ ath where they cast a stones of the passenger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Council must be forced by Sh@@ ame to implement in fact , as he was us@@ eless when dealing with the problem .
the travelers were there in May there and are now back again .
more came yesterday evening , probably still more . &quot;
they added : &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by having a long ceas@@ es to protect their parks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am not happy without at the Stre@@ ets@@ bro@@ ok road and I am not happy to continue to pay my pri@@ mate if the Council can not even stop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a living who didn &apos;t want to be called : &quot; it is ri@@ dic@@ ulous , we just have seen the last round of these travelers to be pl@@ otted by another round .
the numbers have raised this time and you even saw a horse in the park . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker at the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware of an unauthorized warehouse in the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ bro@@ ok Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to go on as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to support our ass@@ ign@@ ments , it is very important that as many an@@ he present a anti @-@ social or cri@@ min@@ ated behavior in the police by calling on 101 .
this helps to create a picture of the situation where the judgment must check when we submit our case . &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof becomes Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts is currently being renovated and will be opened on 1st March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closing of the hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the then structure operating company mbH to the 13th of April 2014 the period of approximately 30 000 nights per year was lost and also revenues by the tourist tax .
in autumn 2014 has been given dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came into the land@@ mark , offered in the land@@ ing building , as well as an umbrella @-@ accommodation , which can be held for contro@@ vers@@ y discussion .
the city &apos;s oceans to ensure the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers in order to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was at that time in the common@@ place not un@@ contro@@ versi@@ al .
but in particular the Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts Ober@@ may@@ meister Julian Os@@ s@@ wald defending the hotel location and spoke at the time of harv@@ ested prosp@@ ective interested in the house .
he should not keep right .
the Group of Lu@@ isen@@ ja with its headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of three @-@ star @-@ Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter facility four houses .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Perf@@ al@@ b .
you hot Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof since a long time ago , he has been standing in front of the entrance , and if one enters the house , it will clearly work , with@@ standing extensive renovation .
the so@@ ils have been covered , ceil@@ ings to part , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
until March there is still much to do .
&quot; it is actually a lovely place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything is to be renewed in the Black @-@ Art Nou@@ veau style .
the rooms are equipped with large @-@ equipped showers , the entrance area is designed , there will be new windows .
everything sol@@ le later &quot; beautiful brus@@ g@@ ern@@ ah , &quot; how Thomas Sch@@ erer was express .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a p@@ endant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , spa area and a meeting room belong to the equipment .
one wants to not position on the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale center , empha@@ sized .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its about 60 rooms w@@ ool to spread a broad scale .
both individual holiday makers , groups or busin@@ ess@@ men should feel at home at the hotel .
talks with OB Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Tourist dire@@ ktor Michael Kr@@ ause he already run , so Sch@@ erer .
the ideas of the city are covered with those of the hotel group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are on the same line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to specify exactly .
just under one million euros , it expects .
also the outdoor spaces are brought on belly , this is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard there is a large terrace that is open from the restaurant that is public to be accessible .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ äre : us @-@ speci@@ alty sets up the Grand Jury
in Russia @-@ aff@@ air around US @-@ president Donald Tr@@ ump shall be a special medi@@ ator of Robert Mu@@ eller after a report a so called Grand Jury .
the panel recorded at the work last weeks , the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; wrote on appeal to the cause of familiar people .
the paper turned the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller its investigation is extended and intensi@@ fied .
the sender C@@ NN reported it has already been the first pre@@ lad@@ ations of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ ack@@ ant son and a Russian Ombud@@ sp@@ erson .
us intelligence services rendered to the Krem@@ lin since extended , targeted in the presidential system 2016 mixed .
pattern exam@@ ines whether there were there between Tr@@ umps and Moscow and Moscow .
in the focus of investigation , several men should stand in the campaign as a consultant of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
according to that , Mu@@ eller also took more and more tr@@ umps and business environment under the mag@@ ni@@ fier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote some weeks ago that the special medi@@ ator of Tr@@ ump have been moved to the center and the preview , whether the president in the wake of aff@@ air may have been under@@ mines the judiciary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to examine and decide the present evidence in possible bl@@ az@@ ing cases , and to decide whether acc@@ us@@ ation shall be raised .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also known as charges .
mostly they will be swit@@ ched when it comes to greater and contro@@ vers@@ y cases .
the procedure is always done behind for@@ ested doors .
the panel can also be swit@@ ched from the prosec@@ ution , for individuals to move under E@@ id .
according to the sender C@@ NN already appe@@ als , which were issued around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ R. and a Russian Ombud@@ sp@@ erson .
those who were involved in the meeting , be called to a statement that was called in the report .
in addition , they should provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ R. there were also Tr@@ umps advis@@ ors and in @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared Kus@@ hn@@ er , as well as his then election campaign against Paul Man@@ a@@ fort in conversation with it .
right wing threads were told on Thursday evening on the US television that the sub@@ stitution show that patterns in his work cannot be intim@@ i@@ ded and that he should be necessary to act quickly .
but it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be swit@@ ched on the end to decide on the collection of a prosec@@ ution .
nevertheless , the post@@ pon@@ ement of the Gre@@ mi@@ um of the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the President on Thursday morning a speech in West Virginia , to represent Russia &apos;s aff@@ air as a campaign in its political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Russia history is a total in@@ vention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the topic give the Democrats an opportunity to feel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good because they have nothing else to talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special ber@@ ater T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in an opinion , he ign@@ or@@ se nothing of the replacement of a Grand Jury .
but this work also usually in secret , he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House supports all actions that acceler@@ ated the work of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former F@@ BI @-@ Chef James Com@@ ey have said three times that will not be chosen against the President .
one is no reason to believe that something was changed in the statement .
Mu@@ eller was not used only after Tr@@ ump com@@ ey was fi@@ red .
because of this re@@ mark were the sp@@ ake against Tr@@ ump loud , he made the judiciary .
Com@@ ey said in June before a launch committee , Tr@@ ump made him asked for an attitude of investigation against the then national security ber@@ ater Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president stands because of the study under a great print .
according to the representation of U.S. media , the White House is responsible for the special medi@@ ator and its employees .

otherwise than an independent speci@@ ation of Congress Centre such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate Aff@@ äre in the later for@@ ret@@ ate president Richard Ni@@ x@@ on , has prov@@ oked a position , in which it was theore@@ tically determined by the president of the J@@ us@@ al Ministry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several Senator of both parties want to be taken by such a step . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two groups of rep@@ ublic@@ s and democratic Sen@@ ators put on Thursday regul@@ ators before which the special medi@@ ator could no longer be released so easy .
Ant@@ arc@@ tic : gig@@ antic Eis@@ berg is driving in the Ant@@ arc@@ tic
in the West@@ ant@@ ark@@ tis , a gig@@ antic Eis@@ berg has been resolved by the Al@@ si@@ tion size of Berlin .
the piece of Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener @-@ Institut für Polar@@ stern und Marine forschung on Wednesday with .
the over a Bil@@ lion ton heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometer great KO@@ LO@@ SS t@@ una now to the north and will probably be two , three years until he mel@@ ted .
it is located with 175 kilometers length and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the largest ice s , researchers have registered over the past three decades .
a danger for people does not go out of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how the climate change has played a role in the break@@ through of the ic@@ eberg , is still un@@ clear after research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
overall , however , there has been an series of unusual break@@ throug@@ hs in the region , writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a factor area .
according to the opinion of many researchers , that could be mer@@ ging with the creation .
the un@@ broken KO@@ LO@@ SS has so far been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ot .
Sch@@ el@@ celeb@@ rates swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by big gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it continues to grow into the sea and is always breaks off .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s lies south of South America almost at the top of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula .
north of this shot was the balance of wax and break down a few years ago .
a full shot was there , he writes AW@@ I @-@ resear@@ cher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
it also talk a lot to that even the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ot is in danger , because the aforementioned rab@@ te have never moved back as far as pres@@ ently .
it also stand for the ice plate below stress and might be dist@@ orted , if at a key@@ hole a piece ab@@ bre@@ ed .
the mel@@ ting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg increases the sea level , as it climb@@ ed on the water and dist@@ ress as much water as it comes after the mel@@ ting itself .
however , the loss of the celeb@@ rates is that the gl@@ aci@@ ers can come directly into the sea and much more quickly than before .
this could possibly increase sea level , however only in the lower size , writes the British research project for the observation of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic ( Mi@@ das ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ot is according to AW@@ I @-@ information with almost 50 000 square kilometres , the fourth largest Sch@@ el@@ ot of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , on the front to the free ocean around 200 meters .
there it breaks it regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although there is a natural hand , and no direct connection to climate change is , the ice is now into a endang@@ ering position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from British Sw@@ an@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most far withdrawal since the start of records &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; confirmed it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under scientists are contro@@ versi@@ al whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ot now grow again and possibly merge together , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
even if this researchers carry out the ab@@ out@@ break of this gig@@ antic ic@@ eberg , so in recent decades are so many ice r@@ acks of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula .
this long ornam@@ entation of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic extends towards South America .
according to data the research program British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Sur@@ vey is the ic@@ ile of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula since the 1950@@ s around 28 000 square kilometers .
in the decline of the temperature pro@@ increased .
the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula has been around 50 degrees around around three degrees and are en@@ umer@@ ated with the areas where temperature at the fast@@ est .
CD@@ U wants to contact the staff
because it becomes increasingly difficult to occup@@ y free places , ur@@ ges the CD@@ U , from the employer , to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer pause has acquired 41 new places in administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the county management of M@@ ett@@ mann .
now even 17 appr@@ enti@@ ces their first working day behind themselves .
the teacher at the circle are obviously very popular .
around 620 applic@@ ants were able to spend the places in this year .
nevertheless , the circle is missing to be able to deal with the embro@@ ider@@ y requirements and tasks .
currently there are at circle M@@ ett@@ mann , as before 50 not occupied places .
we are looking for among other doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration .
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG Initiative in cooperation with the F@@ PD and the U@@ WG Initiative in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the administration should work according to the wish of the parties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a concept for recruitment and personnel development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to cover not only short @-@ term demand in trade leaders , but forward @-@ oriented the assessment of the applic@@ ant , is called it .
the concept concept should be oriented towards the inside and outside , concrete measures for cross @-@ to @-@ ups and contain a train@@ ees , urge CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this has a good approach for a good approach .
because the circle has to do with a personal problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities represent a good officials and offer and offer attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the talk is about a regular &quot; competition of public employers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it comes to a high number of employees , the nur@@ se or alter@@ ing conditions of the service that fails .
so the highest time to action so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Nations , leader of CD@@ U , goes beyond the common request with his party .
he has long been going back in the circle for a f@@ aust@@ rop@@ ic surprise when he asked the st@@ reak@@ s public into question and the other parties were aston@@ ished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; peoples want to be veri@@ fied all the possibilities that make an Austr@@ als from the municipal worker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we are not at short notice to a satisfac@@ tory solution , the county management should also be with the unions - perhaps also in collaboration with the leg@@ ality , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; peoples &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to pay the CD@@ U , the employees and officials better than there is the cul@@ mination for public service actually .
the sal@@ aries are currently exactly pre @-@ written , enh@@ ancements or more money there is only when you change into a higher stage which is oriented to profession @-@ years .
however , the tasks of the circle have risen more and more in the past few years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms needed to take care of the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitute Law .
last but not least by the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ Council Thomas Hend@@ ele and the dire@@ ktor Martin Richter a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy shar@@ pen the tone to NGO @-@ immigrants @-@ bail@@ out
Italy has NGOs , the lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean b@@ war@@ ned that they are not able to continue , if they are not able to hold new rules for their operations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not leave a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how to continue working , &quot; said the Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Tur@@ iner daily newspaper La STA@@ MP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities det@@ ectors a boat of the German aid organization &apos; youth R@@ ettet &apos; , because their crew had worked together with human p@@ endant in a way which facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the au@@ xiliary organization , which has been operating since a year in operation , it is starting to have a detailed lecture on the Italian state of Amb@@ ro@@ gio Cart@@ osi@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us and remains the salvation of human life our top priority . we are sorry that we cannot work at the moment in the search and bail@@ out zone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in an opinion about social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can collect all requests , which are currently collected only after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had the boat of &apos; youth R@@ ettet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , has been monitored since October .
it is susp@@ ected that his occupation inflatable for migrants on board will be delivered to them directly from human resources , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gler can be used again so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such instruction , supp@@ os@@ edly found only 1,3 miles in front of the Liby@@ an coast , according to the Ak@@ te of the state , whose contents of Italian media has been published .
the occupation is sus@@ pic@@ ious out about the authority of the Italian coastal guard , the Res@@ cue in@@ serts in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not to be monitored from any other moti@@ fs that leads away .
under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats as the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta need to have a Italian police police on board who super@@ vised their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs , who are involved in search and bail@@ out approaches , have so far been willing to keep himself to the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter said on Thursday that the new rules as un@@ necessary , but acceptable would they no &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; of their bail@@ outs .
among those who ref@@ used to sign , is the N@@ ob@@ el@@ ri@@ pe organization doctors without limits ( M@@ SF ) .
Minn@@ iti said , meanwhile , that the number of migrants came to in Italy during the past weeks , that the efforts to strengthen the Liby@@ an coast @-@ guard and co @-@ operation with the local bourgeoisie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he gave plans for further talks with Liby@@ an citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with Tsch@@ ad , N@@ iger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants that these countries can rely on hope to reach Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;

nine be@@ eil@@ ed bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berliner outer post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ enheim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz , in order to enjoy four days long tri@@ als and attractions .
for this were three be@@ fre@@ ed guides available .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ enh@@ ei@@ mer valley proved to be a good starting point for tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome .
the first tour conducted in hot summer spir@@ es along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ sk@@ ap@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
it followed points , partly on towers , from which one could over@@ look far beyond the p@@ äl@@ zer forest and the vic@@ tori@@ ous levels .

after the 173 km and almost 4500 m ² , the group had the p@@ äl@@ zer woods of its best side - sport@@ y and cul@@ tur@@ ally .
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ l@@ iga equipment for e @-@ sport
are the sport @-@ stars in future for a computer @-@ con@@ soles , instead of fighting with wind and weather through the St@@ adi@@ on@@ ras@@ en ?
Fak@@ t is : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious sector , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , million fans and huge tournaments included with high costs .
these also have recognised the first Federal League , which increasingly become involved in this field .
at the beginning of 2015 the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later followed by FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , the mid July an E @-@ Sport @-@ Department founded and two professionals for the Computer@@ spiel FIFA 17 under the contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope that all new young audi@@ ences for the V@@ f@@ B &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Managing Director of Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is certain that on this train will still rise again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the coming weekend of football World Association of FIFA in London the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where the gam@@ ers of different clubs are against each other .
besides Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven qualified .
also Robin D@@ ut@@ t provides great potential in the e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Lever@@ k@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen advis@@ es a agency for virtual foot@@ ball@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real football will need to deal with 14 to 30 years ago , that young people will continue to go into the st@@ adium , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the surv@@ eys , all sorts of markets , especially the Asian , to con@@ quer .
with prominent e @-@ sport@@ s@@ men under contract you could be present online by much more often in these markets than once a year the Bundes@@ lig@@ am@@ ann@@ ess to Asia .
what is it exactly ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the E @-@ Sport , computer games like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; League Of Leg@@ ends &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Dot@@ A 2 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or even the so@@ cc@@ er simulation of FIFA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
long ago , as in normal sport also , being established , in which the pro@@ s play against each other .
and in Asia , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program .
but is it at all around an appropriate sport ?
for many , the idea is safe to get used to be used .
also In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ous has long been deal with the question .
for Professor at the Deutsche Spor@@ tho@@ ch@@ schule in Cologne is E @-@ Sport a sport because he com@@ peti@@ tive and many biological and physical reactions show that you can find also in classical sports - for example to add cardi@@ ovas@@ cular changes , hor@@ m@@ onal changes .
furthermore , it need cog@@ ni@@ tive ability , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast response capability .
professional gam@@ ers should not only work on the console , but also their body are practic@@ ed and attention to the diet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but also problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doping is becoming more and more a topic &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are hard on online gaming , and in the scene faul@@ ts the structures of the classic sport .
positive highlights the scientists highlights high Integr@@ ative effect of the E @-@ Sports .
players are international on the road , this is like a big global family , since there is no intercultural shirts .
a study of management consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) tells the E @-@ Sport a rapid growth ahead .
in 2016 , in Germany over 50 million euros have been implemented , mainly on advertising , sponsor@@ ing and great tournaments .
sales to 130 million in three years is expected to increase the turnover at 130 million in three years .
against the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the football Bundes@@ l@@ iga is not too little .
however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice @-@ ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants .
international are many countries further .
big markets are Asia and the USA where ex @-@ basketball ho@@ ball@@ ers Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodr@@ igu@@ ez on the US Team N@@ RG .
Hollywood actors Ashton k@@ ut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ sport competition Uni@@ kr@@ n .
also in Europe also does a lot .

in the Netherlands and in France the so@@ cc@@ er Bundes@@ l@@ iga @-@ Ver@@ one according to D@@ ut@@ t has now obliged to establish an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; in the European comparison of Germany , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ Management Board of R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann .

it is the reason to preserve the tradition of the association , but also to al@@ ign the company at the same time .
&quot; we live in a dig@@ i@@ tised world , &quot; said D@@ ut@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no time to keep in mind that just the football remains as it was always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Mich@@ elle Carter for the texts , the Con@@ rad Ro@@ y to su@@ icide , condem@@ ned
a woman from Massach@@ us@@ etts was sentenced to two years ago because she has encouraged their friend through text and calls for self @-@ ord .
Mich@@ elle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their condem@@ nation behind gri@@ ds and five years were exposed to nutrition .
Carter was sentenced in June for the car@@ eless@@ ly tones of Con@@ rad Ro@@ y which took place on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Ro@@ y said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is unpleasant .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free .
it was confronted with a maximum punishment of 20 years , but their legal representatives ar@@ gu@@ ed that both they suffered as well as Mr Ro@@ y on an psychological disease .
in red un@@ employed and a cre@@ m@@ ef@@ arb@@ ed Bl@@ use , stood Carter , with t@@ ears in the eyes , with folded hands and down in the eyes , when it was condem@@ ned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your actions have brought Con@@ rad Ro@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the cou@@ ches in the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they ended his life to better make their own better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she has no responsibility assumed , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has no rep@@ ent@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Car@@ ters attorney said , unless it was a &quot; terrible circum@@ stance , which she is completely sorry . &quot;
judges Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , he did not find that her &apos; age or matur@@ ity or even their spiritual side have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
a sover@@ eign read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Ro@@ y , that there is &quot; no day there , where I don &apos;t see the loss of my beloved Son .
I would like that he is proud of me and as I am with all my p@@ ains . I try to bear in spite of all my p@@ ains that we shall bear for etern@@ ity with us to be there for his sisters being there . &quot;
Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ d@@ yn Ro@@ y , said that they will be pursued by the realization &quot; that they will never be part at the wedding of their fr@@ action or would be an a@@ unt for his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer has to have this only person , with whom I was together for my birth , is a pain that I will always keep on my life for the rest of my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massach@@ us@@ etts where it makes it a crime to commit to another self @-@ suffici@@ ency .
Carter was 17 years old when Ro@@ y in 2014 was found dead from a carbon mon@@ opol@@ y in a vehicle .
the case pul@@ led national attention to yourself after car@@ ters tex@@ mitt@@ ent releases , that they have encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; Hän@@ g you on , spring of a building , er@@ ste@@ che you yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she sent them in several news that she had sent them into two weeks before his death while he was with his family on vacation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his self @-@ ord wrote them : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to do , Con@@ rad , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what you have to do is to turn the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judges Mon@@ iz said that Carter is characterized by the death of Ro@@ y sear@@ ched and ass@@ aul@@ ted that they will benefit by any press from the case .
the case has the legal opinion .
among the few , the Carter def@@ ended , belong@@ ed Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , which was sentenced by Mor@@ des on her British co @-@ hostess in Italy before it was released for two years ago .
Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times a comment : &quot; Mich@@ elle Carter deserves compassion and help , not det@@ ention . &quot;

something was different at his place in the cabin , that saw Joshua K@@ im@@ me immediately , even though the extra piece of appar@@ el very small was very small .

Audi should change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face with a bac@@ kl@@ ash
one day before the announcement of Audi said for BMW , that it would be able to update the software in more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
the BMW @-@ Chair said , the company was the opinion that &quot; there is smart options as a constra@@ ints , &quot; and related to European cities - including Munich , where BMW ans@@ ing is - diesel vehicles to ban or limit .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce his diesel emissions .
none of the companies describe the entrepreneurs as a recall .
European automobile manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support the compliance of carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nit@@ rogen ox@@ ides , the diesel motors , are considered as car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ s and can cause as@@ thma .
the cost of automotive manufacturers , systems for neutr@@ alization of diesel vehicles are to install broad@@ cast@@ ed , also take what it makes difficult to keep the cost of cars competitive .
the German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also indic@@ ted for the powerful auto@@ fir@@ es to dig@@ ging and signs of the problem .
the companies are trying to avoid the errors of Volkswagen , which regul@@ ate the use of so @-@ called shut@@ ters which regul@@ ate to comply with regulations , if a car has been tested , but normal driving conditions .
in the United States several employees were indic@@ ted by Volkswagen , others are investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Zac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Itali@@ ans and is therefore not protected before delivery and could be placed in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German cri@@ min@@ als at Volkswagen , after the authorities have installed a system to deal with the emis@@ sion regulations in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States .
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could Volkswagen heavy loads : the luxury automobile manufacturers contributes to the profit of Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ es and the laugh@@ ter against suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo was time @-@ proof of a most @-@ published Cart@@ oon @-@ Gallery , the Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ ases of his figures are his trademark .
also with 85 shows the Argent@@ inian and works on a film .
his message : laugh@@ ter , &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4th August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first few years as an artist , he found himself as a word for luck with - what was fru@@ str@@ ated .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day , when in my job , he said once .
after stations in Lima , New York and Paris , at the end of the six@@ ties of the break@@ through : with the publication of his cart@@ o@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then also in &quot; star &quot; and other leading Mag@@ az@@ ines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
more and again the artist of cities be inspired .
great , r@@ und@@ y Mor@@ di@@ llo @-@ figures cav@@ orting in drawings with the sl@@ ef@@ en tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning he &apos;s own personal information and today is still alive today , working every day almost ten hours .
about calendar , puzzle , puzzles , books for Gros@@ s and Klein , T @-@ Shirts , Pl@@ ush @-@ animals and watches will continue to find their dro@@ pping figures continue to spread worldwide .
for six years he also works on a fair@@ yt@@ ale and a TV series with his figures .
the main person in the film &quot; Crazy Island &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los popular animal in its drawings - that has a thousand @-@ feet as counter@@ part .
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie , which should be sent to the kin@@ king screen .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what they are saying , it is strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo .
the script will not be written by him .
therefore he refers more to the TV series , which is how his original drawings is produced .
lava del threatened from Provence from climate change
he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened from climate change .
the Lav@@ ender is due to the reason of d@@ rought remin@@ ded conditions and because of diseases of transfer@@ ring insects , which try to find solutions to find solutions , great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agr@@ arian institution in Provence , said : &quot; the Lav@@ ender in Provence is effective at risk because the plant was exposed in the past few years , which has brought much less rain in the spring and autumn much more .
this has a effect on the life span of lav@@ ender .
there is also a small c@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium that carries out the Zwer@@ g@@ zi@@ k@@ ades , and with very dry weather there are very many of them . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
lav@@ ender oil is not only worthwhile for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also very useful for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of very long plant tubes with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , AC@@ TW@@ IC@@ K@@ EL@@ TE and either missing or under@@ taking .
so we have less parts with eth@@ eric oil . &quot;
among the solutions that are considered to be considered , a better water distribution and the slow@@ ing of the slow@@ down from the ground , but also the occup@@ ying of plants with a f@@ us@@ hing mixture of sound and water and the development of varieties that are towards dry res@@ ili@@ ent .

the murder of a journ@@ alist emphasises the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce they normally meet up their plans for the reporting of the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , cor@@ rupt officials and un@@ audi@@ ble drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
it was told them that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists are discussing themselves safer : they shall take their children to the office which were in 2009 the goal of an attack with gran@@ ules , or at home .
security experts have three words on a black@@ board at the front of the room , opponent : opponents , neutral , associations .
you ask the re@@ por@@ ter , names for each column - no proof is necessary , perc@@ ep@@ tions and ab@@ dom@@ inal .
there are drug tastes , politicians , busin@@ ess@@ men , journalists , the sus@@ pic@@ ious list of the government or the Kart@@ ell to stand up a catalog of bre@@ wing who hazardous the chaos of Mexico .
there is no glory of violence and throughout the country the cor@@ p@@ ses , are more and more journalists : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena NI@@ E@@ TO ended in December 2012 .
among the latter you will find their editors and your inspir@@ ator of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder of J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and journ@@ alist , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence associated with drugs .
its absence will be deep perceived , although its presence is everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , which indicates its middle @-@ finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; on Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Miri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wearing T @-@ shirts that show his sm@@ iling on face with glasses or its typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the Rep@@ or@@ ter discuss about their shared themes , the trau@@ ma , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although in 2010 a Son@@ der @-@ law firm was built in order to process the cases of journalists , this according to the committee in the protection of journalists have been led to the protection of journalists only two criminal proceedings .
as with most thousands of Mor@@ den that are connected each year with drug @-@ trade and organised crime , the mur@@ derer from journalists will be made rare in court .
at Ri@@ odo@@ ce they still pers@@ ist to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , even though they are uns@@ tr@@ ed and even though the terrain is still ob@@ li@@ que .
without information about the mur@@ derer without justice , the meeting of security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very stup@@ id to write my time in this workshop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we do not know the Why , mis@@ str@@ ust we all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez caused the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the provincial capital of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
he managed to drive it just a few blocks away , before his rot@@ ter To@@ y@@ ota Cor@@ olla was forced by two men . he was forced by his car and 12 times was shot by him , pres@@ um@@ ably because of the name of the newspaper - who is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ v@@ ator river . &quot;
the rest took away by car in his car and cor@@ rupt it in the vicinity .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown children .
sc@@ ents to be free in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
but on the topic of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ mans re@@ ar@@ rest during the past year and deliveries to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the blo@@ ody batt@@ les in the country , since ri@@ val@@ ating groups are strug@@ gling to fill the vacuum .
it does not make it out that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people on the road are shot , or that the cemetery is full of curved , two @-@ stor@@ ey ho@@ een for drug can be larger than many houses for the living .
forget to a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace , &quot; if only one cart@@ el control over the coastal school with its valuable ports and drugs called trade routes in the United States .
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez has been aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ y@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , with the gu@@ ilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understanding have contributed to the murder .
first , in February , there was published in February the release of a interviews with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of the ri@@ val@@ isi@@ ing boxes in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans S@@ ons .
this publication may have the sons , susp@@ ected G@@ ang@@ members bought each spec@@ imen of the issue as soon as they were delivered to tim@@ er@@ os@@ ke .
the second fault lay in it , Val@@ dez does not succeed , after the conf@@ isc@@ ation of another newspaper , the same story had released to leave the country to its own security .
Val@@ dez was a leg@@ end in Mexico and abroad , and its pot@@ tery is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had so long survived , that his friends and colleagues will ann@@ ers that he would always be there .
he was active as a senior re@@ por@@ ter for standardization , when he joined five colleagues on the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and 50 US dollars involved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without going on the d@@ ow@@ ry problem , &quot; said Bo@@ y@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the time the paper served a reputation because of the cour@@ ageous and honest reporting , and the sales and advertising measures .
re@@ por@@ ter loved it , hard tre@@ ff@@ ing studies without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication , in which they could read stories , nobody else to treat .
eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors &quot; Cab@@ ot @-@ Prize &quot; for its coverage in Latin America .
in the same year Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in the persecution of the Mexican drug .
he gave up volunt@@ arily to that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue to live , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J @-@ Award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
drug Trade in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must assume the task that falls off as a journ@@ alist - either that or you play the sil@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you have done so many Dead ... why did you not say what happened before ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce @-@ Team has missed Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird , the like a harbour worker , the friend , who is generous with h@@ ugs and Rat@@ ations , a teacher who knew how you survived .
you trust on his routine .
he would always bear his hat .
he would always be to El Guay@@ abo , the bar towards the office , go there always at the same table .
now ask them : was his love for routine be his desire ?
his death also has forced to question her own assu@@ mp@@ tions in question how they can do their work best and stay alive .
&quot; you do not like it if you are dealing with their wives , their children , their Clean shops , their fur@@ tive run@@ way and cross @-@ rail@@ ways to move drugs .
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ consumption and self @-@ wareh@@ ous@@ ing .
his own inst@@ ability trust .
if it is wrong , un@@ lock it away .
the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real , that &quot; sm@@ ell can be a sense that can be dec@@ ei@@ ved ... and then the thing has happened with J@@ avier . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others shall apply in Sin@@ alo@@ a no longer - just as in Tam@@ au@@ li@@ pas , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states , where a gi@@ fted mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ uten , weak institutions and cor@@ rupt government .
the landscape is changing constantly .
in the room where the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce was met for the safety training , there were suddenly no mobile phones . days before , it was known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments to protect journalists and activ@@ ists in Mexico .
outside the two polic@@ emen protection against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were charged by the provincial government , the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ class district of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
half in Sch@@ er@@ z , some of the Rep@@ or@@ ter , asking if this offic@@ ers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen belonging to the Govern@@ or itself as not tru@@ st@@ worthy .
it is months ago , since the Rep@@ or@@ ter went into the mountain landscape , where the drug bank de fac@@ to are under control .
for the issue of this week Ri@@ odo@@ ce has a three main stories .
there was the murder of the Br@@ ders of the former known Box@@ er Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had a Ex@@ pos@@ é to the state of state that concentrated on the hom@@ etown of the Govern@@ ors .
and there was a group that led in one of the first restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , one block away from the office of the state .
there was no official word about who has been kid@@ n@@ apped or how it came to write , so it was caution when everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite place of drugs and authorities .
a repe@@ ating from public notes , that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy , which belong@@ ed to the govern@@ ors Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( Pr@@ i ) that domin@@ ating almost the whole century all political levels .
recently several Pr@@ i @-@ Govern@@ ors were acc@@ used for high @-@ quality cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real bat to write the Rep@@ or@@ ter , on previous inci@@ dents in this locality , including one where a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man went a military over .
only a few months before the reader had viewed the colum@@ ne of Val@@ dez than the most informal source about the ab@@ duction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we had known what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; because of its slim body . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez has been dedicated to the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers that became against the Mor@@ de of journalists , because the employees have become something they had never expected : activ@@ ists in the name of the press .
re@@ mun@@ er@@ ate Miri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez sn@@ apshot themselves with a few characters and went on the next morning to a demonstration because of another journ@@ alist to the office of the state .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared , three days after Val@@ dez was killed in the Western federal state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is its .
journalists have become more journalists all over the country by participating in organized protests , &quot; SOS Press &quot; on o@@ unds and buil@@ ders .
on this day the director Bo@@ y@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone into Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with the Govern@@ or of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the murder of Val@@ dez @-@ ul@@ dig@@ te Ram@@ i@@ rez the authorities , journalists , and let them leave , because they have said the truth .
she has since asked that it is divided by government again because it is concerned by the government that their W@@ ut has been viol@@ ated their obj@@ ectivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez had repeated that journalists in Mexico from organised crime , are involved in governance and a permanent society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nar@@ co journ@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote that rep@@ lic@@ ter may not only be killed on drug banks , but also on command of politicians and security forces with organised crime under a blank@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the media @-@ group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has shown more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you specify because they would like that you dis@@ proportion@@ ate the mouth , &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez .
obviously , the mor@@ de have a terrible effect .
nobody forget the death of the blog@@ ger@@ in Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ li@@ pas six years ago .
your body was found together with a note that was supp@@ os@@ edly signed by Z@@ etas @-@ Kart@@ ell , &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer sam@@ pling and ear@@ phones next to their separate head .
some stores have chosen to close how the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the correspon@@ dent of the correspon@@ dents Mi@@ ro@@ slava B@@ reach in March .
others will continue as there El Man@@ ana from Nuevo may did according to the murder of their directors in 2004 .
in 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ arez public on the drug screen with an editorial on the title page &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists are out of their home states or even out of the country .
it is a pain@@ ful decision .
it &apos;s hard to find work in ex@@ ile and they still observe the streets and search for dangers .
and sometimes they will be ch@@ ased as it appears to the photograph@@ ers Rub@@ en Esp@@ in@@ osa , which was mur@@ dered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City , three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay back and continue the work , it is a daily dance with risk potential decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be po@@ et , gives us that the drug will scar@@ es him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and that is why I became re@@ por@@ ter , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to mid@@ night last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , sa@@ ver the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on the bourgeoisie and d@@ rank of beer , than once all their tel@@ eph@@ ones began to Sum@@ men .
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with Band@@ o@@ yst@@ als and safety sc@@ ented in the vicinity of the seaside Ma@@ z@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed t@@ all@@ ote .
the war escal@@ ated , as it was promised by a number of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
from the Bord@@ st@@ ony k@@ ante , they published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via mobile phone .
the front page had to change on the next day .
Sir@@ enen he@@ ul@@ ten near - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ y@@ or@@ qu@@ ez cast a look at the polic@@ emen who stopped to see if they were in willingness to see .
if they had not afraid they did not show it .
under the enormous portrait of the fil@@ tered founder of the newspaper , whose middle @-@ finger was visible for quite Sin@@ alo@@ a , followed the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce its tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you also only remember , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ y@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if on the same day , on the J@@ avier &apos;s mor@@ nings , I asked to send it to the road to the road . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dinos@@ aur@@ s used cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to devi@@ ate its enemies
at first glance it looks like a statue , if also a sc@@ ary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now researchers have found researchers that the first findings of the incredible nas@@ og@@ horn of a Canadian mountain work was so well preserved that experts are described as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa the Din@@ os@@ aur@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was so well preserved that they could even notice that his created skin from red@@ dish Braun was - and they said , she could have had something from a &quot; un@@ quiet past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current Bi@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dre@@ amed him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ar@@ mor@@ ed dinos@@ au@@ r that ever was found , and one of the best dinos@@ au@@ r copies of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fos@@ sil is a newly discovered kind of N@@ od@@ os@@ aur@@ s , who lived in the middle of the circle between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
its un@@ believ@@ ably well preserved condition has resear@@ cher that describe it as &quot; really remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Geo@@ graphic is the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant fres@@ ser the best preserved Fos@@ sil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn funk , as he built on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b .
he met something that seemed to be seen from the surrounding rock mistake , and decided to look more accurately .
the Fos@@ sil discovered Fos@@ sil was sent into the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1.@@ 100 kg ) heavy stra@@ wberry .
after all this hard work the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you are only a little with the eyes blin@@ zeln , you might almost believe that it has slept , &quot; said the main aut@@ or Cal@@ eb Brown , scientists in Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the cre@@ ature has to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will go into the history of the history as one of the most beautiful and best @-@ preserved dinos@@ aur@@ s - the mon@@ a Lisa of the dinos@@ aur@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found that this plant fres@@ ser , although he is covered with a arm@@ ament and resem@@ bles a changing pan@@ zer , probably of meat fres@@ hly dinos@@ au@@ r .
the strongly ar@@ mor@@ ed Din@@ os@@ aur@@ s used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to hide themselves before smo@@ kers , and used a shi@@ el@@ ding technology , which is used as counter@@ sh@@ aded , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed it to mix better into his surroundings and expresses his enemies , saying experts , which was threat@@ ening that it was threatened by bigger dinos@@ au@@ r .
the 110 million years old cre@@ ature from the family of N@@ od@@ os@@ aur@@ s took place for the first time in May and is now seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers studied the wild animal studies and it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli named after the Muse@@ um@@ st@@ echni@@ ker Mark Mitch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,@@ 000 hours .
the amazing preservation of spec@@ imen allowed it Dr. Mitch@@ ell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and form of sc@@ ales and arm@@ or over his body to document .
they discovered the counter @-@ p@@ adding , a common defence method in the animal @-@ rich , which means that the tip of the cre@@ ature was dar@@ ker than their under@@ side .
although the counter @-@ p@@ adding is common , the results are surprising because the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is far from that of today living animals survived .
it indicates that the dinos@@ aur@@ s of plenty of pressure through flesh , watch dinos@@ au@@ r that the evolution the wear of the con@@ frontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use the counter @-@ p@@ adding - think of ro@@ e , z@@ eb@@ ras or gir@@ d@@ als - are much smaller and more vulnerable than boot@@ y that sign@@ alized that this N@@ od@@ os@@ aur@@ s a real fight for survival had been exposed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong pre@@ y behavior on a massive , strong @-@ pan@@ ed dinos@@ aur@@ s how dangerous was to have been the dinos@@ aur@@ s @-@ m@@ asts of the cra@@ w@@ age , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis organic compounds in their sk@@ inal shows even that the skin of the dinos@@ aur@@ s rot@@ ating was .
scientists will continue to investigate the animal on notes about his life , including its counter@@ ing intest@@ ine to find out what it had eaten as his final meal .
they believe that the dinos@@ aur@@ s died , when he died , in a river gr@@ ated and into the sea , where he sunk on the back to the bottom gravel .
at that time Alber@@ ta was as warm like South @-@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably have much more flo@@ or@@ ated than they are today .
&quot; this n@@ od@@ os@@ aur@@ s is really remarkable , because it is fully covered with preser@@ v@@ ated skin , but also in three dimensions and ret@@ ains the original form of the beast , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; the result is that the animal is just as it looks like in the early cra@@ yon .
you do not need much imagination to re@@ produce it . if you want just a little bit with the eyes sh@@ iel@@ en , you could find almost believe that he is in sleeping . &quot;
the cra@@ yon time was a time , as a huge spa , busy dinos@@ aur@@ s , which rose up on two legs , the earth went through .
although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ nos@@ au@@ rus Re@@ x , millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed Din@@ os@@ aur@@ s were shot by some of his terri@@ fic ancestors .
this belongs to the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ os@@ au@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .
scientists , whose recent findings appear in the journal current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta has been hal@@ ted after death in the sea and turned into mu@@ d .
the cre@@ ature was found by Sha@@ wn funk , as he built on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b .
according to the museum it is the clear@@ ed pan@@ os@@ aur@@ s of the world , including skin and arm@@ ament , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hips .
the creatures were on average approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have up to 3,000 metres ( 1.@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch @-@ long points that rag@@ ed from his shoul@@ ders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant fres@@ ser was lo@@ wer@@ ed by the Western Canada , until a flo@@ o@@ ded river to flo@@ o@@ ded into an open sea .
but the underwater expl@@ oration of the dinos@@ au@@ r ret@@ ained its arm@@ ament in exquisite detail .
the hidden remains of this special spec@@ imen are so well preserved that the skin remains still super@@ vis@@ aged plates along the dinos@@ au@@ r .
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko is written for National Geo@@ graphic , such a level of preservation is such as rare as a win in the lot@@ .
the more I go , the conf@@ used it will .
pet@@ ri@@ fied of the skin still cover the hol@@ low @-@ plates , which contribute to the skull of the animal .
his re@@ chter on his side is on his side , his five fingers are split up above .
I can count the shoe on his so@@ h@@ le &apos; .
in th@@ under : Mass@@ am@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A8 : many los@@ ers
dis@@ astro@@ us accident on Thursday &apos;s night on the A8 : nearly 30 cars are engaged in a mass Ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are lots of last , kilomet@@ re stra@@ aus - and g@@ aff@@ er .
at the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) are in@@ ju@@ red on the late Thursday morning in a mass Ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age about 20 people .
after the first information of the police were between 17.00 hours between the junction of Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( land@@ mark Ai@@ ch@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during one th@@ under@@ age almost 30 cars , including probably trucks .
more information about the exact number of the publ@@ ishers are not provided .
it was done for light to medium @-@ sized inj@@ uries , told a police speaker .
a great up@@ lift to lif@@ ebo@@ at was at the un@@ exp@@ iry place .
the A8 was fully locked in the direction of Munich .
in the office in Munich , a roughly ten kilometers of a long gap .
as an A@@ Z Rep@@ or@@ ter , it was also reported on the counter@@ drive to massive disabilities - by numerous g@@ aff@@ ers .
the fire@@ brig@@ ade is the marking of the vehicle who now have to count with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 o &apos;clock , another second accident on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
it had come to a coll@@ ision between an aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ spor@@ ter and a car .
a rescue @-@ hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter was on the road to dis@@ waste .
Deutsche Bahn : Group t@@ ested &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has already experienced : nothing is sitting in the train and sleeps .
or you is deep@@ ened in his work and just got a brilli@@ ant thought .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
comes the Schaff@@ ner and ar@@ ouse an uns@@ ett@@ ed or irrit@@ ate the ride in the middle of the work@@ flow .
ch@@ assis control .
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn are currently responsible for the creation of loose ch@@ assis control .
you simply confirm by mobile phone that you are taken to its place and carry them the ch@@ assis .
currently running a test operation on two routes .
&quot; is the offer of what we made it out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available at the beginning of next year on many other remote routes in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a train speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; calls the train the ch@@ assis range without Schaff@@ ner .
to use the use , however , some conditions must be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to have booked an online ticket - what do already have to do most of the passengers .
you also have to have purchased it via the App of the railway , the DB navig@@ ator , what is the most convenient way of ticket .
and finally you need a seat for reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works so : one rises in the train , calling his ch@@ assis under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then an Button will be released into an electronic de@@ valuation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; electronic &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
access to their mobile devices will receive a message that ch@@ ast X is located on the train and taken the seat Y .
comes to access control of the thick@@ er control of space Y white he knows that there is a passenger with already ent@@ worth@@ less online ticket .
one can thus continue to sleep , continue to remain silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who wants to travel together without ticket control by our train staff , checking in the DB Navigator itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this allows the passengers to make their travel time on the train , &quot; says Michael Peters@@ on , marketing @-@ board of DB remote traffic .
second Plus : &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to the individual customer needs . &quot;
who often drives , white , that beside del@@ ays and ver@@ sten gul@@ ps belong to the largest trouble @-@ assurance .
for many times , one has itself , in any case one of the people do not send all the documents you need for the de@@ valuation of online tickets .
either the credit card or the brief@@ ing or otherwise a document you must have .
the result is endless discussion between conc@@ ept@@ . and ch@@ ast , which leads to worse mood in the ab@@ part or large @-@ room and del@@ ays with the control of your own ticket and taking the Schaff@@ ner at the end of time to take care of other concern .
only a small number of test customers use the new service .
and that can only be found on the links of ICE , Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE , Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further accessibility at the same track are not yet un@@ released .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell until her core was fil@@ tered .
just one day after she arrived in New York City , sat the accommodation in St. Louis bor@@ ns on the bed of a Air@@ b@@ nb apartment that rented her and sc@@ roll by Facebook on their phone .
she st@@ um@@ ented via a Post of someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year child and it is still on the road , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
conf@@ used as nobody else on their feed the information sent , she joined Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was continuously obtained on their tim@@ eline ret@@ we@@ et@@ et .
the Rap@@ per from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ ol@@ ds , who was killed by a white polic@@ emen in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed live .
he po@@ sting a picture of brow@@ n@@ standing body that was spread on the street and would stay four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is wild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thought Fer@@ rell with himself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for her and her community .
she put her mobile phone to return later in the evening to call on people at the Can@@ field Drive .
there were photos of the police band and people , the sh@@ out@@ ing and from a man who had called Father , who carried a sign with the wording : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police just got my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
they wat@@ ched a live @-@ feed , in which a pol@@ ishing is in front of a group of prot@@ esters with a bell@@ enden dog .
in another video , she said , ent@@ in@@ sured another pol@@ ishing is his gun and prescribed : &quot; I will kill you ... animals all . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not usual , &quot; remin@@ ded of Fer@@ rell on their statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder in which we have acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to us and we can name typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment I felt shooting .
I was angr@@ y and we@@ pt . &quot;
you booked a trip and went home on the next day .
after the land@@ ing at 23 o &apos;clock she brought her 6 year old daughter of the house of their father and decided that the two next morning we would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; , in the cin@@ emas from the 11 .
it is a history of survival and Protest@@ ant , of love and loss of resistance , the strength and resistance of resistance , which live from the viewpoint of the people who live in community and streets have to ask the streets to challenge answers .
as a Fer@@ rell with her daughter who drove a flower @-@ dress and a suitable crown , pra@@ ises the two a conversation , which they were inn@@ umer@@ able times before this morning , on the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not remember how to fight you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; do they believe in what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police have killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not take them away , &quot; said Fer@@ rell later .
&quot; what happens today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
she needs to know and see it and being raised in it .
she needs to be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization but also the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to get freely to ourselves .
even though I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally had no e@@ kl@@ at@@ ants rac@@ ism , it is not different than the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have the feeling , I would prove her a bad service to keep them away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when she arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , there was on the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place towards the police authority , which was at a Camp@@ site as the activ@@ ist on the possible non @-@ indic@@ t@@ ment of offic@@ ers in Wilson .
they have Fer@@ rell and her daughter connected with a local partner owner , the lunch made .
they prepared po@@ ckets in front of and hal@@ es them on prot@@ esters .
slowly began a new kind of activ@@ ism for fer@@ rell form .
&quot; my activ@@ ism has changed after 9 August , she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President in Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and was concentrated on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had no experience at the Organ@@ ise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it has come all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weeks later he met Fer@@ rell during an evening @-@ demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ director of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Luc@@ as Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ r@@ ar wanted to only be documented , &quot; what happened .
a question came to Fer@@ rell in the sense : &quot; do you have documented , or tries to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
this sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of men , often of femin@@ inity - in a community that prof@@ ited by her pain and resistance .
as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently explained in an interview : &quot; we had heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and grew up their voices , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director of Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area , which is known for his activ@@ ism around T@@ od@@ est@@ ra@@ kt @-@ In@@ s@@ assen .
his commitment brought Fer@@ rell the project closer , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after brow@@ ning shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we talk &quot; said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me how these people are represented , for so I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was to focus on Ferr@@ ells experience - to show that it is in motion , not for a Messi@@ ah @-@ leader , but about a community that is summar@@ ised , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the off@@ s participant in the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a result of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets show documents from &quot; Wh@@ ose &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ &apos;s life , as she loves himself and her wife married . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and lau@@ g@@ hed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be certain viol@@ ability in this work and in the perpet@@ ual of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ ar@@ oll &apos;s history repeated the role of the black flo@@ ats women in the broader Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter motion .
two of the three founder of the movement , who have influenced by the pot@@ ter of the black teen@@ agers Tra@@ y@@ by Martin in 2012 the film &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as Schw@@ ul .
&quot; black , pregnant women in executive positions have borne the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we are still fighting for various fron@@ ts .
black , sul@@ ule women need to carry the main load of everything . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an agre@@ es to notice that &quot; the movement truly is maintained by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is however that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ atism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; action is &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; at the Fer@@ rell due to its identity as a heart of the film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the person who raised this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said she . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no co@@ incidence , although it was at front the front , because in a life on these cros@@ ses as a black , spir@@ ule woman is so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
in the meantime , the messages force in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on has gone on long , but the r@@ acial connections between the community and police are still standing .
Fer@@ rell is for 2 ½ years because of the block@@ ade of a highway at a demonstration .
it describes the social @-@ policy atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; a m@@ ess . &quot;
nonetheless , they have committed himself to a song and she feels that memory since three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on to the road .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love each other and support .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; Si@@ zing &quot; : TV @-@ readers discuss about bit @-@ gallery
the bit Gallery moves the people , even though they are not built long .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the inter@@ mitt@@ ing of the pedestrian prec@@ eding has been un@@ folded since the first presentation of 2009 the population in suppor@@ ters and opponents .
cold leaves the subject of barely one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also on our Facebook @-@ Page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the one to the bit gallery say : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; This would be genuine class &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; needs no man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ erne ) or quite simply : &quot; Si@@ zing k@@ ahn ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) .
while the advoc@@ ates are building that a gallery attrac@@ ts more customers into the city , from also the other stores profit , fear the opponents , that then the pedestrian prec@@ ari@@ ous blo@@ ody .
added : the gallery will be planned in the property on the property where the peas@@ antry market stands , in the 13 direct market products offer their products .
with the beginning of construction work will be the conclusion .
the gallery @-@ M@@ acher want to integrate a Mark@@ thalle in the construction - and for the Bed@@ a square , with the possibility to sitting outside .
Simone Rooms : &quot; we have been almost a week at the peas@@ antry for many years .
mostly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the Land@@ fr@@ auen always very happy .
even the but@@ cher we have discovered for us .
we would like to hope that during and especially after building the gallery a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether the direct market in a Mark@@ thalle in the Galerie arri@@ ves , comes at the height of the rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is likely to be not just low for the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; wo@@ und@@ ane @-@ branches in Bit@@ burg ?
whether Cl@@ othing , shoes , drug or supermarkets : I find that super@@ flu@@ ous .
there is already enough in our city .
one sees how many car@@ go shops here are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even an extraordinary weekend market , it is um@@ so important that at least remains at least the market hall .
for all , the goods offered there is been fresh , mostly directly from the producer offered and is top @-@ priced .
as you see , charges will be logged in a shopping center only by bigger firms , for the d@@ ort@@ igen Mi@@ eten are often not viable for a single ret@@ ail@@ er .
too bad , special busin@@ ess@@ s is almost no longer and what still remains , will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a m@@ all with a Mark@@ thal fits me not together .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
mainly : where is the peas@@ antry market during construction time ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery will actually happen .
or creates the Ges@@ pen@@ st bit Gallery previously , all the stores from Bit@@ burg to distribute ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this simply will not work .
and a shopping center that is empty , there is no one .
in my opinion it would have been better than to promote a real farmers market instead of this gallery .
but for a farmers market hall gi@@ b it is thanks to the wa@@ hn@@ sin@@ ess many - as I find a sen@@ eless construction projects in Bit@@ burg no place more .
when the peas@@ antry market will be broken , again a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
an ideal simil@@ arity : artist creates portra@@ its with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the room of Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York there are many faces - white , black and brown , which are almost im@@ peculi@@ ar same - the hang@@ ing of the ceiling .
the 30 portra@@ its were created by the artist in H@@ eather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ far and Haar@@ schn@@ itten that were sent by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the cuts from prison to Fort Le@@ ading worth , where the former secret service Analy@@ st had a 35 @-@ year imprison@@ ment after it was considered a secret diplomatic news about the website Wi@@ ki@@ Le@@ aks publicly .
the new exhibition that was opened on 2 August , is called A B@@ ecom@@ ing resem@@ bl@@ ance ( one suitable simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspon@@ dent between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline goes its expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ wife and weg@@ wei@@ de , whose condem@@ nation has been converted by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorith@@ m analysis of the DNA , which could be interpreted by Mann@@ ing such as anyone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the in@@ oug@@ ente Det@@ er@@ min@@ ism of these inter@@ pret@@ ations - but also to identity .
Mann@@ ing who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already talked about to the identity as a woman , there was sentenced to 20 acc@@ us@@ ations , including six violations of the spi@@ on@@ ag@@ eg@@ es@@ etz , computer was and theft .
through the prison was her picture supp@@ res@@ sed , so much that there was only one single photo - a gr@@ inder , black @-@ white blessed , in the Mann@@ ing clearly sit in@@ probably on a ch@@ assis and a plat@@ inum blonde permit - with which it has been associated .
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came straight from the great success of their 2012 @-@ project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
therein , the artist @-@ portra@@ its of stran@@ gl@@ ic art@@ ef@@ acts like c@@ ett@@ ings and Kau@@ g@@ um , extrac@@ ted the DNA from the waste in order to restore an image of it as these people could look .
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a temporary agency .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; stated De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg in a press exhibition of the new exhibition .
and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photograph@@ ed , therefore they took contact with Chelsea , and asked them if they wanted a DNA portrait .
the artist and their inj@@ ected M@@ use were found to un@@ equal British bri@@ dal , over the course of two years several letters .
she even illustr@@ ates one of the Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustr@@ ated com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ res@@ sed images , &quot; which would be a future ten@@ ah , in which the president has been given to judgment and it would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing release after seven brut@@ al years would demand in a military cip@@ her in Kan@@ sas was a will@@ ful kind of happ@@ ine@@ ties .
there is also now at the opening of the exhibition a little deeper and Star@@ kes , since Donald Tr@@ ump leads to war against inform@@ ants from the government , and against trans@@ gender troops to find new capable of rig@@ id divisions which he actually should fix .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as De@@ we@@ y Hag@@ borg after the rare timing of all of these things was asked , she said that &quot; things happen for a particular reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in one on the wall of the Gallery of the written artistic statement called Mann@@ ing with their over@@ sized signature , including the &quot; i &quot; in her sur@@ name ( the &quot; i &quot; in her sur@@ name ) an end of &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose foundation sex , bre@@ ed , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ ale DNA @-@ sequence - a thousand feet of C@@ s and G@@ s and As , in a pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ al hop@@ ed to show through the involvement of the 200 letters ( or nu@@ kl@@ e@@ oti@@ de according to the highly developed scientific Lex@@ icon of the artist ) , how amazing similarly , at least in biological ways , we all are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what people will hopefully take care of who we are and how open gene@@ tic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg whose video @-@ works of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , also to see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA @-@ data can tell as many different stories , therefore the 30 of these stories are &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is preserved in an own space , is a page from the above mentioned com@@ ic @-@ Nov@@ elle .
it shows Mann@@ ing how it emerg@@ es with a fre@@ cht@@ el@@ ef@@ on in hand from discipl@@ in@@ ark@@ as@@ cent of the United States such as King @-@ Kong .
&quot; if they ask your speech , then they have won . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; said the artist , which gre@@ et from Philadelphia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get acquain@@ ted when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition - as it was predic@@ ted in the com@@ ic book - but if they should do it , then it will be greeted in the middle of the room of the mas@@ ks , who are compiled by their own gen@@ om@@ ic sim@@ ul@@ ously , which are reflected as hor@@ des of proteins .
this was also pur@@ posed , as everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , written by their gene@@ tic h@@ ap@@ log@@ gers with pencil .
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted it to feel like a human being , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portra@@ its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted that it feels like a mass movement , who formed with Chelsea , like the movement which was also behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

COR@@ NE@@ LL @-@ Dur@@ an@@ leau was still explained at the place of the action for dead , and det@@ ective investig@@ ative the stit@@ ching as a murder , while the police actively seeking to the two susp@@ ects , said officials .
La@@ them has been a professor of Micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University .
Alan K. Cub@@ b@@ age , Vice President for University president , said in an e @-@ mail statement , that La@@ them now has been pra@@ ying now and was excluded from the campus of North@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a key matter which is investigated by the competent authorities and the North@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is a Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
a nar@@ r@@ ator of the University and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US @-@ charge authorities in any way . &quot;

Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call of the building of the Grand @-@ Plaza Building , who had just received a r@@ alled tip that had happened in the apartment .
the police describe the scene as a very cru@@ el .
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said , it is un@@ clear whether the for@@ efr@@ ont have taken place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren in the building were .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation of the inhabitants : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the offering , and expl@@ ored a variety of moti@@ fs , including a possible home inci@@ dent . &quot;
&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA @-@ road@@ map in the near future - the Russian Vi@@ z@@ ep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
the Russian Vi@@ z@@ ep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said , it will not take long before the remaining criteria in the world @-@ anti @-@ doping agency ( WA@@ DA ) for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ doping agency ( R@@ USA@@ DA ) will be implemented .
&quot; in a certain stage of fulfil@@ ment of the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ USA@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ doping ) .
the WA@@ DA @-@ road@@ map was updated in this regard , &quot; explained Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM comm@@ ented the second part of the WA@@ DA to observe the code which describes the criteria for re@@ placing R@@ USA@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organization .
according to Mut@@ ko , it contains nothing but for Russia occasion might be on concern .
&quot; everything was announced , everything will be implemented .
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , he added .
one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , that the Russian anti @-@ doping authorities reported the reported results of the WA@@ DA approved by the Canadian At@@ tor@@ ney Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren has to publicly publicly accept D@@ op@@ ings in Russian sport .
with regard to the matter Mut@@ ko : &quot; we carry out the examination as our anti @-@ doping system to an error .
all measures have been implemented .
but there was no state programmes , and we will not ad@@ mit what does not exist . &quot;
Mut@@ kos words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the director of the independent Russian anti @-@ doping Commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales point R@@ sport at the beginning of the day gave Sm@@ ir@@ nov problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ doping organizations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report is contro@@ versi@@ al positions and regulations .
no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , added Sm@@ ir@@ nov .
R@@ USA@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 in the course of the doping &apos; Sk@@ and@@ als from the WA@@ DA of D@@ op@@ ing@@ controlled in Russia .
but it has been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti @-@ doping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the main lod@@ g@@ ings of the organization in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA @-@ Direct@@ orate @-@ Direct@@ orate , Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli , that R@@ USA@@ DA move &quot; in the right direction &quot; moves to be used again .

the start @-@ U@@ ps that will help your business not to become the next U@@ ber
Amy In@@ die wanted to measure the happiness in your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surv@@ eys did not work .
answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - gri@@ eved .
and even if you negl@@ ected anonym@@ ity , some workers shall not fail the process .
&quot; there was simply never con@@ sist@@ ence and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ding that the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care Society Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed operates .
she called people from outside for help .
a new race of Human Resources start @-@ ups is on the wax to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licens@@ ing of software , which has the specific purpose of the measurement of the employee engagement , they allows companies to offer surv@@ eys , speci@@ ality and compl@@ aint groups , allow employees to handle requests , and in some cases of whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lowers , the C @-@ suite ex@@ ecu@@ tives to handle and turn right to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said J@@ im Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ tics tools used to measure employees work .
it said that she has a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
in addition to S@@ nap @-@ surv@@ eys and surv@@ eys of certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company that indicates which units most complaints have and which ex@@ ecu@@ tives to dis@@ able results - so you can war@@ dly , why .
companies come to see that at the head of the workplace @-@ culture , so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber who has been engaged in sc@@ and@@ als , who has since been a former employee who have spoken a blog post , who have spoken an environment of ins@@ ig@@ ations , where those who have spoken , pun@@ ished .
for start@@ up @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t is this desire for an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative busin@@ ess@@ ness .
the Global Governance , regulation and Compliance sector could have more than $ 118@@ ,@@ 7 billion value 2020 according to the final technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to avoid bad behaviour and see , saw an arbit@@ r@@ ary interest and activity in the beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Conver@@ cent has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ nb , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
U@@ ber has recently registered as a client ago .
as G@@ lin@@ t , leaves Conver@@ cent companies customized &quot; powder &quot; surv@@ eys , confidential answers in real time and view the warmth maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line , in which employees can report real behaviour .
and if the main business guide is included , complaints are directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judgment of public opinion has recorded the shelves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick Quin@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a company is found that its employees are badly treated or un@@ ethical , it can experience cost @-@ play@@ ful consequences due to consumers &apos; boy@@ c@@ ott , worker @-@ Fl@@ uk@@ tu@@ ation and Kl@@ agen , said Quin@@ oa .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant @-@ chain with more than 25,@@ 000 employees and more than 500 locations , has conver@@ cent for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their enterprise .
formerly if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or e @-@ mail for the company central , a formal compl@@ aint and hope that he was seriously taken .
it was often a intim@@ id@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , &quot; James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good opportunity to follow the complaints from staff .
well , since the company conver@@ ts , the company can pres@@ upp@@ oses problems that have previously seen by leaders who have been hidden in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or in@@ loud practi@@ tion@@ - faster and be addressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can get closer to these holistic , 360 degrees view into experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who guides the risk management Group from Ruby Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders in employment and gener@@ aliz@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
company began to take eth@@ ics , values and employees work in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen due to the En@@ ron @-@ sc@@ andal , said Quin@@ oa .
but it lasted until the &quot; Social Media to their right , &quot; that corporations could not prevent that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online .
&quot; prior to the use of technology for monitoring of eth@@ ics , men , hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t as well as Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and charging the companies with recur@@ ring fees for the use of their products .
it is a business model and an opportunity that will find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start@@ ups .
Conver@@ ters won $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sap@@ ph@@ ire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , which was raised the entire capital at $ 47 million .
glu@@ ing safety $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought its entire financing to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprisingly , given the net@@ worked nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research , which shows that today &apos;s employees are more expected from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Sili@@ con Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only in@@ serts .
the employees want the feeling that you accept and appreciated that you will give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are glad to be in a company that their votes is , and that the work that you do is worth it , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emp@@ loyal Experience in Linked@@ In that both conver@@ cent as well as g@@ lin@@ t .
investors reach Ren@@ di@@ ts when their portfolio companies run well . businesses are running good when employees are committed and committed .
if the Analytics @-@ tools of third promise , commitment and commitment to employees , it &apos;s no wonder that you can find support .
the data about the staff commitment based on the experts of the workplace @-@ culture is important .
but the data are us@@ eless if the car@@ et@@ akers of a business cannot take action .
in fact , if a company asks for your feedback , it can have a expect@@ ation that changes on the way .
and if the change does not come quickly enough , or at all , this dis@@ appointments the dis@@ appointments and assu@@ mp@@ tu@@ aries .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you have to have ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International , who have seen themselves very much on the collector of data .
&quot; for if you do not follow the people , &quot; Hab@@ t her really belongs to me ?
do you take care of that ?
and whom you don &apos;t worry about why should I ? &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , which now leads to monthly employee Poll@@ s , was able to interv@@ ene measures on the same day if a problem is told about G@@ lin@@ t .
and after the collecting of feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated staff , she was able to re@@ build several teams within the company and to add a communications training to address the problems .
at Ruby Tuesday , the company receives new insights about the employees , and it hopes that in a long run , this leads to a better binding of workers in a sector which is known for high circum@@ ference .
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose people , you lose also customers .
and if you lose customers , then you will lose businesses .
N@@ CA@@ A remo@@ ves the two @-@ days practices and makes a long day for fr@@ action
it &apos;s on 23 o &apos;clock , when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA Foot@@ ball player on one side of the new exercise fields of the team on campus .
some have moved their toll @-@ level and show the back full of swe@@ at from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , this very few minutes put a lunch break .
players who are written to the summer courses , are returning after the tri@@ umph of exercise , before they return the next morning at 6 : 30 am to the water@@ man Foot@@ ball Center return .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the next three days a genuine T@@ ret@@ m@@ ühle &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer J@@ im Mora shortly before the Monday to Tuesday was . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminated two @-@ days exercises , to facilitate the load of the player , and she has actually extended their days - at least until the finale on Friday .
therefore the first three trainings of the U@@ C@@ LA at 19 : 15 o &apos;clock begin to meet the already packed sched@@ ules of the players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the rup@@ tions was moved almost one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six games times in West@@ wood practical exercises .
you should hold off the course in the course of August 18 exercises . 20 before the start of formal players for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mora said that he under@@ scor@@ ed the control of N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add the multiple @-@ time routes of the player to add another point .
&quot; we put this enormous strain three or four days on them , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mora .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it to her , they plac@@ ements themselves , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it really will be great . &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will termin@@ ate their practices as soon as the camp is finished , which in view of the clear visibility of its fields of an adjacent park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , which was already built with foot@@ ball@@ asts , which is already used with foot@@ ball@@ asts , no slight task will be .
fr@@ action players should occup@@ y the hotel from this weekend , but Mora space that it could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mora . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far from thinking that people rent there a room and then set there on it to record a exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the vide@@ ob@@ and of a exercise , it is a fairly good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security gu@@ ards on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I am not so too much worried that I am not too great .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against coun@@ terf@@ eit news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with Fal@@ sch@@ emati@@ te of third parties and their results under the origin@@ als then view , the world &apos;s largest online social network network am Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so called F@@ ake News .
the company said in a opinion on his website that will start with the use of updated automated processing methods in order to identify possible Fal@@ sch@@ isms and to send it to Fak@@ um@@ bes@@ fer , which may be displayed by the original receipt of the original article .

&quot; besides knowledge , which stories are attracted by Fak@@ r@@ ex@@ agger@@ ation of third parties , people want more context to make @-@ trained decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Produc@@ er for Facebook @-@ News in a blog .
you add that Facebook continues to be a feature to the &quot; related article &quot; and to other changes to his messages feed to reduce wrong news .
creation of a Com@@ ic Language : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past the small Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squ@@ ee@@ ze @-@ Musik@@ video and was for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher into the 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ er years ago .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history of its cozy seat at the P@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now the inspiration for a graphical novel of Jam@@ ie Rhodes , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ ar@@ igen Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ ference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so nice to look at the man@@ us@@ cript of someone who has been dead since 300 years &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he says angr@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; um@@ ch@@ t the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families that illustr@@ ated in Scot@@ ney - Isaac Hand@@ leb@@ wi@@ cz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Is@@ abel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rhodes , which is based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was un@@ expected emotional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only wrote on the th@@ um@@ b print on the side of a letter that has written that of a double bed in the 1700 @-@ s , he worked for the Jac@@ ob@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is his arm@@ ament !
and letters always sm@@ ell after smoke , because then it sp@@ ake a fire because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the sm@@ ell has a effect , as if he himself would be .
ach , I love Archive ! &quot;
for someone who have done so with ancient papers , that he was supported by National Trust and the Arts Council England and almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have heard my welcome gru@@ ß a little bit &apos; ) , this seems to be all too beautiful to be true .
Rhodes spent his days with this , the vi@@ kt@@ ori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle to study the archives and study the many treasures and cur@@ i@@ ties of the castle , such as the mon@@ ted hy@@ gi@@ vers on the walls and bottles , which had spent centuries in dit@@ ch .
he emig@@ rated through the terrain and ruins of the old castle , and spoke of land , gar@@ dener , and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; Whis@@ key and started to write . &quot;
the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust received full access in 2006 as the last Er@@ am , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died .
as Rhodes a decade later , the employees just started to take care of the archive which he said than &quot; hundreds of years , in which ari@@ st@@ akes said &quot; Oh , wir@@ ing it on the loft . &quot;
di@@ ary books , letters from the time of the English sens@@ ing , cards , who said , who would be said , &quot; said Rhodes , &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have fought the two families .
guys , let &apos;s go all its gear ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to read on broad@@ casting on the English story , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , who leaves a guy who leaves the newly built castle to join the peas@@ antry .
&quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il that entered into the castle in this book with the title &apos; K@@ nigh@@ tly sur@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rhodes .
&quot; the peas@@ antry began in this area and I thought , a revol@@ t was a good beginning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the two are linked ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly ro@@ oted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; who tells the story of the Jes@@ uit pat@@ ron , the family of Dar@@ rell &apos;s seven years in the English Re@@ formation .
or &apos; The Sm@@ ug@@ gler &apos; , presented in the sm@@ ug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell from the 18th century , which he filled up a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was done only years later than his coff@@ ees was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rhodes &apos;@@ favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the l@@ ords of cro@@ oks to be , always debt and make money for things that they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ Men del@@ ights their school@@ den@@ y by having rich old women - I imagine it as a bunch well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to adver@@ tise Er@@ bin@@ nen . &quot;
after the end of his use in the castle Rhodes is looking for other unique scre@@ ams .
he has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic @-@ novel on El@@ em@@ än@@ mä@@ ki , the terrain of a san@@ ity from the early 20th century , which has been returned from nature since then .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; says he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now I have to be done with the dam@@ n life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign started : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the filling of the 301 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honnef has started its campaign to launch a new roof ( Rund@@ schau of Thursday ) .
still till Thursday want Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team at Nel@@ son Art@@ z the logo and the slogan .
at the end of August it should be the highlight of the campaign a festival on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too nice for us .
or ? , ask the cre@@ ators of the action since yesterday on the po@@ sters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we think this ( natural ! ) not really &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; write it on their yesterday release website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but we use this measure to gain your attention .
and to make clear that man@@ ches is better than it seems .
basically , we are the firm conviction that we as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ ore citizen to know the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city very well . &quot;
in the action it takes around more than &quot; one logo and a slogan , it means further .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is , a single @-@ standing promise to form@@ ulate one , which gives the city an un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able everyday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , they stand in the competition with other commun@@ es .
a medium @-@ sized amount is the town of Bad Honnef its new roof , and the campaign was cost .
military re@@ forms in Turkey - Earth gan@@ s are afraid of the army
every year at the beginning of August advis@@ es in Ankara is the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) via reti@@ erungen and carriage in the offic@@ er of offic@@ ers .
so also this week .
at first glance a normal procedure .
but nothing is routine in the Turkish dispute a year after the Put@@ ty test .
the meeting did not take place in the building of the general group , as before , but in the establishment of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the discussions took part in the Presidency of the government now also the five Vi@@ z@@ ep@@ re@@ mi@@ ers as well as the Minister for defence , internal , justice and foreign affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , the civilians in Y@@ AS were in the number of over .
the government moves to the army in the military .
general stab@@ le@@ ef Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the com@@ ic acid of the Hit@@ eres , the air forces and the nav@@ y were put .
since the gesch@@ ei@@ ter@@ ten Cou@@ p has led n@@ ut@@ ef Erd@@ og@@ an 169 of the 326 gener@@ als and Admir@@ als .
over 10,000 soldiers have been removed from the ranks of the Army - mostly because of its connections to the movement of the ex@@ ile @-@ Pre@@ dig@@ ers Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erd@@ og@@ an as wire pul@@ led of Putin &apos;s attempt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 486 people , which should be involved directly at the Put@@ ty trial , is active in Ankara since this week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the put@@ sch I had called Erd@@ og@@ an to the over@@ lay test as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worship &quot; &quot; &quot; , since he gives him the opportunity to puri@@ fy the armed forces &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but has Erd@@ og@@ an the army really under control ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of February the newspaper &quot; hur@@ ri@@ yet &quot; has released an article with the head@@ line &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dis@@ continued in the military @-@ headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the General@@ st@@ ab give it concerns because of an increasing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islamic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the army , which manif@@ ests itself among other things in the lifting of the head of sol@@ ete for soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the large @-@ keeping near the army and the security forces is at any rate further .
mid July leaves Erd@@ og@@ an per Dec@@ ree for another 7@@ 395 cou@@ ers , including 23@@ 03 polic@@ emen and 546 soldiers .
it seemed that as Erd@@ og@@ an the military dom@@ ed .
the gener@@ als are earlier than the actual men of the country .
three times put@@ ted them under appeal to their role as a gu@@ ardi@@ ans of the world@@ ly state .

Washington changes the rules for Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , quot@@ ed by the media .
he sees the legal immigrants to the 5@@ 0,000 per year , more str@@ ing@@ ent regulations to ensure vis@@ ation of visa for a fre@@ ez@@ ing working permit and limitations for families @-@ oriented visa .
the new rules are proposed by the rep@@ ublic@@ ans and by the President .
the law@@ less@@ ness should be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax pay@@ ers and will do this by the US the way citizens will be issued by other countries of Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will replace the chains migration and replace the current system .

Ministry of the trail wants to print track for racing
again over the past few months over the future of the racing sh@@ utt@@ les were sl@@ ed - now it should be very fast .
even before the end of the year , at the busy track , on which the economy drives , is built .
in order to secure the future of the racing sh@@ utt@@ les in the long term , according to the information of the traffic game , even this year we will start working on the route .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to order and evaluate the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ ingen , who knows the country to this mainly for tourism important connection , &quot; stated @-@ state secret@@ ary Klaus S@@ ühl on Friday in Erfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of maintaining the stretch is estimated to approximately 2.5 million euros .
from this sum , the country will take 75 percent .
the contract , on its basis the shuttle is to be ordered in the future of the country , I will be definitive , explained in the future .
the Ministry and the Southern th@@ ür@@ cher Bahn as an operator can be found about the technical details already .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the timetable used for vehicles and quality standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ ühl . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the St@@ amp will be closed for a duration of eleven years .
hence , the race shuttle service will be ordered on December 2017 .
the racing shuttle is especially popular among tourists popular station between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ ingen .
in the course of the past few months , in the course of a pilot company has been tested if the route of sufficient many people is used to order them back in the future .
the route is also very strong in parts .
the rise of sex robot is real and we should not worry
just as you thought that it can not yet be crazy , comes a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots .
yes , actually .
sex robots are currently a big deal .
recently published the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Rob@@ otics ( Foundation for responsible Rob@@ otics ) ( F@@ RR ) a report on the development of sex robot in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , em@@ eri@@ ti@@ fied Professor for Rob@@ otics and Arti@@ ficial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of the F@@ RR , we must begin to take their Asc@@ ension seriously .
customers can choose the oc@@ ular colour of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and type of fingers .
&quot; people make yourself funny , but the companies deliver any quantity of it , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key with the release of his new report .
modern s@@ exp@@ s have developed themselves from their inflatable partners with a Sili@@ cone , which warm and feels warm - with aware of human reactions , which are achieved through the artificial intelligence .
the user can also adapt its robot to their beliefs &quot; and select everything , from the eye color of the robot to the type or color of its fingers .
but it will still become more distur@@ bing , as many robots have the &quot; person@@ alities &quot; own , who would look to a Step@@ p @-@ woman .
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ds have developed to Rob@@ ot@@ ters with a si@@ p @-@ scal@@ p .
the real @-@ rot@@ ate robot allows for example to adapt its users to their robots to the properties which they will find appe@@ aling , such as Schü@@ ity .
and then there are still those of T@@ rue Compan@@ ion developed Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot with pre @-@ program@@ med person@@ alities like &quot; Fr@@ ig@@ id Far@@ rah , &quot; which convey@@ s the impression of Schü@@ ity , and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ uro@@ us &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the site of T@@ rue Compan@@ ion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so may they like what you like , and they don &apos;t like what you may not like , etc .
in the course of the day its s@@ enti@@ ments - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; it may be tired , be fixed on contro@@ vers@@ ation or she can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many trou@@ bled aspects in this rise of sex robot - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ ordin@@ ate female properties , the play@@ grounds on rap@@ e , if one is a step on Fr@@ ig@@ id ( means here : contradic@@ tory ) Far@@ rah , see a quiet one most .
on his website , T@@ rue Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with an VI@@ BR@@ AT@@ OR , but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( si@@ c ) can have a VI@@ BR@@ AT@@ OR , why do men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is called it on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or halt just another sex .
their emergence and their increasing refin@@ ement show something dark ones in our culture , to a retreat from the Ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with sub@@ jug@@ ation as an optional addition .
most men will of course keep no sex robots , and while the fo@@ ils hold its rising pop@@ ularity . they still stay pro@@ visional at the edge of consumption .
but what from the edge @-@ to @-@ sick@@ ed , can be in relation to the spirit of time in which we live , very instruc@@ tive .
and many people are not strange or bel@@ lied , until them the free market there are permission .
there is a certain flo@@ ating that these highly developed sex robots in a period that are threatened with a period in which the rights of women are threatened in the White House , who have under@@ mines the woman sex@@ ually attacked .
the ab@@ omin@@ ator aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ ma@@ id &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphical images , the slaugh@@ tered body and the spread eye , but how real this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a di@@ p , but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap .
the goal behind these sex robot is to make an physical simil@@ arity with actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with por@@ no@@ star propor@@ tions ) .
their buil@@ ders want that they feel decent , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , on the point when it comes to their &quot; person@@ alities , &quot; the robots do not represent any real women .
you cannot separate yourself from your companion or simply walk away .
they do not have an arrangement or a background story , nothing , which imp@@ lies on independence or anything , which could distur@@ bing the fant@@ asy tot@@ al sub@@ jug@@ ation .
otherwise expressed : you are f@@ ake sl@@ aves .
or to express it in the Re@@ de@@ wise of 2017 : ma@@ id
Tr@@ umps big performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the in@@ tru@@ ce of a healthy life state
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has become a spell of the Tr@@ ump @-@ era that the political divisions which have pol@@ ari@@ zed the US @-@ elect@@ orate , also families in small format . &quot; &quot; &quot;
around Christmas and Ern@@ t@@ ed@@ ank@@ fest gave it in the US newspapers with advice on how to deal with the hor@@ ror of Tr@@ ump @-@ relatives .
we rig@@ orous ourselves all supp@@ os@@ edly to let our filter bl@@ oss@@ oms .
less noticed is the power of tr@@ umps to co @-@ ordin@@ ate families .
I consider this because my C@@ ous@@ ine , an lin@@ ks@@ gr@@ ated po@@ wers who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , I visited this week in New York .
they remin@@ ded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House is everyone who knows them , including the rep@@ lic@@ ating k@@ ins@@ hip , with which it had fought for decades , suddenly and quite odd on the same side .
to the dining table , this is certainly a good thing , but it falls me in another connection that this also brings significant risks associated with yourself .
the left was reinforced by Tr@@ ump , but the ent@@ ing effect of his presidency has the power to push us all right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ ading way that we will no longer be rep@@ ay@@ ment of a day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there is a sc@@ ary long@@ time scenario in the Tr@@ ump of rep@@ ublic@@ s of the right wing , &quot; normal &quot; that suddenly appear in comparison to its standards as an in@@ term of reason .
I find myself being part of an active N@@ ost@@ al@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ neys who fall - the dog on the Aut@@ od@@ ach , which saw 14 % income tax ( but at least w@@ knew we see how his tax return ) - both compared to tr@@ ump in fact occur .
when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of Republi@@ can only be spirit@@ ually healthy to qualify for themselves as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
as my C@@ ous@@ ine in the city was , we brought our children to the Kar@@ us@@ sell in Central Park , the largest of the Car@@ us@@ sel@@ ls of New York Park@@ department , and the best three dollars that one can spend in the city if you need any caffeine .
the horses are huge large , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cool@@ ed and the animals are turning to look full of fear about their own shoul@@ ders - extremely dark and the cli@@ m@@ per@@ ture music convey@@ s this to peculi@@ ar fashion .
so many cl@@ ues of a city dis@@ ap@@ point : the views of high buildings are old , the Sky@@ lines are become familiar to provide a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice .
five @-@ thirty years later and I am still not all over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - the topic @-@ pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage counts not - but a big roundabout in the north of London .
the Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magical experience , since here two years old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ few years can go on it and all have a great time .
if I could have been able to evaluate the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked afterwards .
on the other hand , I was obliged to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could draw my credit card .
in the Coff@@ ee &apos;s corner on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option , the rating with a 15 % tips on the same - to buy something about the shop .
this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to put your personality into a situation in which no need is required .
the poor woman in the department store stood ap@@ hr@@ ingly , while I made tired the experience made my credit card with five stars .

software update for diesel vehicles : what people need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers in an overview .
at the diesel Summit we have offered BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
you are supposed to improve the g@@ ass@@ ing of cars of the E@@ TS classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ diesel or bad are taken from it .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in from ACE Auto Club Europa are covering :
is the new action of compul@@ sory ?
no , the software updates are optional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the compul@@ sory updates previously apply only to vehicles , the Schum@@ al software &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
its retro@@ fitting has arranged the force @-@ company @-@ Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the makers have announced a better implementation in the next few months , but still no precise appointment .
Daimler has informed us to write everyone concerned .
if already become a inspection , it will be done within their scope .
how long are the re@@ plac@@ ements altogether ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; said S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
the relationship between the commitment of the manufacturers and the political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen , volunt@@ arily negotiate the car manufacturers at the topic of environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long is the update last ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ rise can be to get an appointment .
what are drivers who don &apos;t want to drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE may be waiting for you .
probably the foreign manufacturer would draw up with so s@@ met@@ an@@ in .
threatened , now a massive prize of Euro @-@ 4 @-@ cars ?
the ACE fear@@ ed this .
but just in the regions , where travels .
in the rural areas there has so far been no extra charge for older Diesel .

bike on line thrown : the south @-@ track locked
according to police , the most known perpet@@ rat@@ ors had thrown off the blue bike of the railway station in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ enes road ( B@@ 116 ) .
these were so strongly damaged that the her@@ ap@@ oration of freight for@@ got to be raised .
the Medi@@ ator go from two male offen@@ ders and search for the night@@ time after them .
near the Tat@@ ort we had a ros@@ ary sho@@ ots and a bike riders have been observed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a village &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ Spe@@ ech Christoph Pos@@ ch to APA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the or the perpet@@ rat@@ ors would have brought itself into great danger and also to traffic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
besides the damage at the L@@ ok and the plant , as well as the dispatch of the car and the cost of rail transport may also be sent to the perpet@@ rat@@ ors of the railway customers to the perpet@@ rat@@ ors .
total be out@@ going from a &quot; significant &quot; sum , &quot; said the speaker .
the damages were fixed on Fri@@ day@@ in morning , the railway traffic on the south @-@ track could be run without disabilities .
almost ten stro@@ kes had fallen in the morning , two of them consider the teles@@ cope .
the goods they fell from , but they had a delay .
according to the Ö@@ BB spok@@ es@@ man of Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged about 200 metres above .

rich meat , da@@ iry products and chocolate could help , IB@@ D ( infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory intest@@ inal diseases ) .
cr@@ otes meat and chocolate can sound for your diges@@ tive system as a night@@ mare .
but a new study maintains exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in flesh @-@ based proteins and da@@ iry products , the symptoms of patients with infl@@ amed intest@@ inal diseases .
the incur@@ able condition , in the USA around 1,3 million and in the UK 300@@ ,000 concerns , magne@@ ts and bl@@ eeding , recur@@ ring or blo@@ ody break@@ down , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while those affected usually come , meat and da@@ iry products led to lin@@ ders , found researchers at the Wash@@ ing@@ ton@@ er University , that the essential amino acid Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to the immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant D@@ arm .
the leading researchers , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , said that imm@@ ick cells in the intest@@ ine pat@@ rol , to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes , which hide themselves in the meal , not penet@@ rate into the body .
cells , the ability are , infl@@ amm@@ ation trigger from cells to promote tolerance and protect the body without delicate tissues to harmful .
if the balance is too far in the direction of infl@@ amm@@ ation , it can result a infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory intest@@ inal diseases .
in experim@@ ents was established that a kind of tolerance acqu@@ iring immune cell in mice , which pre@@ domin@@ ating a particular bacter@@ ium in their initi@@ ates .
and the bacter@@ ium required Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a link between a bacter@@ ial - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ tion , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had of this immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an an Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han rich nutrition should be toler@@ ated , less infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory intest@@ ine , when the same system also acquire man .
the Post@@ d@@ ok@@ tor@@ and@@ in Dr. Luisa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an under@@ su@@ ed a kind of immune cell that had the tolerance and found that a group of study re@@ ws had such cells but another group of the same tribe which was not separately , this was not had .
they susp@@ ected that the difference between the intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ od@@ om@@ es of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and mush@@ room that are usually live in the stomach @-@ arm trac@@ tors .
the D@@ är@@ me of the mice were found DNA @-@ sequ@@ ences and were found six bacter@@ ial species which were available in the mice with the immune cells but without them with mice .
mice were raised in a ster@@ ile environment so that they lack@@ ed a intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ om and they did not developed this kind of immune cells and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
to understand how the bacteria rests on the immune system , the researchers did grow into an fluid and then led small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ri@@ pe immune cells that have been isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed to the toler@@ ant @-@ promoting cells .
when the active component of the liquid was puri@@ fied , it proved to be known as a by @-@ product of Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ met@@ abo@@ ism , which is known as In@@ do@@ l @-@ 3 @-@ militar@@ ism .
if the researchers have dou@@ bled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the food of the mice , the number of such cells are hal@@ ved around 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ values were hal@@ ved , sunk the number of cells around half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an said that people are the same toler@@ ant @-@ promoting cells such as mice and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect ourselves in our stomach @-@ intest@@ ine .
it is not known whether Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ tribut@@ aries from L. reu@@ ter@@ i can develop the cells in people as in mice , but defic@@ it in relation to Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory intest@@ inal diseases .
she said : &quot; the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote , since these cells control infl@@ amm@@ ation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; potential can lead high t@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ ane in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i to extend this pop@@ ulation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic is obliged to have a &quot; geni@@ us . &quot;
at Manchester United has signed a &quot; geni@@ us with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , believes Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ field player had his de@@ but against S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia .
the 40 million po@@ und signature of Chelsea started with 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the U@@ EF@@ A @-@ Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressive on the Hol@@ der @-@ role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira to Bel@@ i@@ eben .
M@@ atic was however excluded from the Pre@@ par@@ ation Asia @-@ tour of the bl@@ ues and just 45 minutes , which had to improve Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a geni@@ us in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
besides M@@ atic start@@ led also Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u in the Avi@@ va @-@ St@@ adion , as Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .
the Independent covered in this week that Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho still had three further new li@@ abilities , but he was on that the club has already made a &quot; fantastic job &quot; made three of its four pre@@ defined new li@@ abilities .
&quot; three of four to get , thank you for the club , he added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four of four for me , but they have given great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on the wheel shi@@ fted , the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole was a continuous test for new engines .
Bo@@ eing has already made such an advertising earlier .

new depths for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem
how the wind is turning : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel still the SPD leader was , bli@@ ck@@ ten Social @-@ democratic minister before elections are always with a certain concern to Berlin .
only no stor@@ ing from the party central , just no head@@ wind from the le@@ ague - so much the most important wish of the elect@@ oral batt@@ les .
since Martin Schulz the party has changed tremend@@ ously since Martin Schulz .
since then the employees are watching out from the Willy Brandt @-@ House with growing the events in the SPD @-@ governed state cap@@ itals .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described in the approach .
there were depths of all .
and that one after another .
the federal government sees after the un@@ ending end of the red @-@ green majority in Nieder@@ s@@ achsen , a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; that shows once more : red @-@ green can simply not be ste@@ ady , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editors of Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
the surprisingly strong fac@@ tion of a green @-@ party members gave the government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) pushed into a serious crisis .
five months before the first @-@ day election , his red @-@ green coalition makes up their A @-@ voice majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Gre@@ ens leader Michael Kell@@ ner has promp@@ ted the de@@ ed Nieder@@ s@@ ächs@@ ische Green @-@ representative El@@ ke T@@ ISH promp@@ ted to return to their mandate .
the over@@ turn to the CD@@ U means a clear ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ mination of the constitu@@ ent of the elect@@ orate .
El@@ ke T@@ wald has to give back its mandate immediately , &quot; said the Federal Financial leader and election campaign in the Gre@@ ac@@ tion@@ Network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this should not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not yet true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s@@ igh the SPD s@@ ander &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than on the free morning the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ bot@@ age reached the party of the party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan W@@ eil , SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands after the over@@ comes the green Socialists and Democrats called to the CD@@ U without its own government .
it is the preliminary highlight of all the ranks of large and small crises in the SPD @-@ associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the mis@@ ery began with the un@@ expected defeat in the Saar@@ land choice in March .
a blue eye , more not , cal@@ med the comrades @-@ time .
after the country @-@ elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia will be anything differently .
it was then too - and this was all significantly worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the Tau@@ d@@ les , the Düsseldorf side of the Party .
weak@@ ened the comrades in the weeks after that .
then when she had just got a new courage , the G @-@ 20 @-@ Summit came from Hamburg .
and with him the next depths .
Mayor Olaf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD land@@ ef , lost on that weekend his N@@ im@@ bus because he is in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while his city burned .
and because he did go wrong in crisis communication , so pretty much the wrong thing you can make wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz is fighting for its political survival .
so now Stephan W@@ eil .
because of the VW @-@ g@@ asi@@ fication and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Nieder@@ s@@ ächs@@ ische Prime Minister has already been in criticism .
Mi@@ ese re @-@ values came to .
nevertheless , or perhaps that , he tried to set up more and stronger in the last weeks over the past weeks .
the stri@@ ving of the former bourgeoisie of Hanover , his power in Berlin was not hidden his power in Berlin , and was not hidden in the environment by Martin Schulz .
they left him , since they den@@ otes a stabil@@ isation of the party .
well , the exact opposite could occur .
this meets W@@ eil at the part@@ ei@@ internal tw@@ ist of the Nieder@@ s@@ ächs@@ isches Green , basically no fault .
and Schulz not at all .
one effort do not try to keep the comrades at its own ranks .
your wr@@ ath is aimed at the Gre@@ ens , and here mainly on the light@@ ens parliament@@ arians .
&quot; it is un@@ bear@@ able and Democracy , like Ms. T@@ esting their own car@@ ri@@ ans to eat about the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ ers@@ ch , Chief of the Part@@ t@@ ines in the SPD @-@ Bundestag , the Red@@ Pri@@ mer Network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Mrs. T@@ ades is not elected because of their person as a direct channel in the Parliament , but on the state of the Nieder@@ s@@ ächs@@ isches Gre@@ ens in parliament , so that the Nieder@@ s@@ ächs@@ ische representative will continue .
the logical consequence would be that she returns their mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Chief of the SPD @-@ Bundestag , a &quot; unknown man@@ eu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; the constitu@@ ent of four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan W@@ eil to the Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who runs the Nieder@@ s@@ ächs@@ ische SPD to the Bund@@ est@@ ag@@ s@@ election , the R@@ ND .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now em@@ ul@@ ter@@ ated the personal car@@ ri@@ ed@@ ings of a future CD@@ U @-@ S &amp; D members &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called on the back@@ grounds .
I want to know if there has been more or it is continuing the CD@@ U Nieder@@ s@@ achsen .
funding for Ort@@ ig@@ ers III
who wants to re@@ alizing the home in the years can soon get support from the country .
in an informal Mayor of Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of the revolutionary urban development on Wednesday in received .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler gave even a review to that so far .
since 1991 there has been in received @-@ building areas .
back then , in the refurb@@ ishment of I from 1991 to 2004 , the State of Baden @-@ Württemberg was still taken two thirds of the conveyor .
in the refurb@@ ishment area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still at 60 percent .
for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the recent renov@@ ations are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; success project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - it is finally important , also to foster internal development and not only new building areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on April 4 , you have received the information from the president of the Council in Karlsruhe that there will be a refurb@@ ishment III .
the funding tot@@ r@@ age 833 euros , of which c@@ ubs 500 000 Euro from the land , the rest of the church received .
how does a re@@ organization arises ?
one will continue to examine as Sh@@ ind@@ ler , where the &apos; really old &apos; houses are .
but it also plays a role whether in the planned area in all interest you believe .
if necessary , the District borders might then be post@@ pon@@ ed .
the Mari v@@ ats at the Medi@@ af@@ ch@@ eve Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
the cellar presented the contents of the federal states program &quot; Social City , &quot; in whose framework would be carried out .
core of the program are the rev@@ itali@@ zation of internal , the improvement of the living and work conditions and expansion of infrastructure .
the measures would be objects covered , which means that is per piece .
the refurb@@ ishment would eventually set as stat@@ ute .
the authori@@ zation period for the funding is running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
however until the end of this year , however , the survey will be carried out only once again , as part of the re@@ organization involved in the re@@ organization involved .
in November or December is supposed to take place as possible for the atz@@ en@@ act@@ ment to be started in the coming year with the re@@ al@@ loy@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann said that each commun@@ e was going to carry out studies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about to evaluate the city of mis@@ ery mis@@ ery and decide when re@@ formed and to what extent .
for the respective land there is also a san@@ itation in the ground@@ book .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come back once again and get a picture from the situation , she spoke .
Got@@ zel stressed , a significant success factor for the project be the participation of the parties involved .
that is why there will be questionn@@ aires in the coming weeks post@@ al to the citizens and can be filled until the end of the summer holidays .
the yellow questionn@@ aire is the &quot; building and bon@@ b@@ ows , &quot; in which it is among other things about construc@@ tively condition and re@@ development views .
in gray questionn@@ aire , the &quot; household and housing , &quot; can contain information on size , distribution and residents of a living room .
the blue &quot; Operating bow &quot; is only to fill if in the building business rooms are operated .
however , it is to be observed , it pointed out to be a fulfilling frag@@ ments at the same time a request for funding .
moreover , new construction measures are not promoting promoting .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler empha@@ sized that the distribution of conveyor belts after &quot; Wind@@ de@@ duction &quot; function - who first comes , m@@ ah@@ lt first .
you could not book the funding for later . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the end still pictures of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ort@@ sk@@ ern II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to make the present a reconstruction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

a bri@@ tish invent@@ ors is the first in the country working with a micro chip , so that he can open his front door , and can even start his own office and even start with a hand @-@ movement .
St@@ even North@@ am , 33 , had impl@@ anted the tiny chip between th@@ um@@ b and th@@ ef@@ inger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .

the technology resem@@ bles a cats and dogs of anti@@ oni@@ zed micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
the company from Mr. North@@ am wants to change the locks of houses and cars , so that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra charge of £ 300 per lock .

the adver@@ tiz@@ ing of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ ers of thousands
the decision of the White House , a marine hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter for an event that highlights the American production in the last month , cost tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the indications of the military , which have been left to 24,@@ 000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board was the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and conduc@@ tive officials of the White House took a tour of all the 50 states .
the hel@@ ic@@ tic@@ ut hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter was issued next to a yacht made from Maine , a fire@@ auto car from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a for@@ kli@@ ft of the Mississippi River .
the military office of the White House requested the presence of hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter in a frag@@ mentary order or FRA@@ GO , barely 36 hours before the hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter on the South Lav@@ ic@@ op@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit , which is responsible for the operation of the hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter .
&quot; I just wanted to know that you are aware because it is an unusual event with high visibility is , &quot; wrote the Com@@ man@@ de@@ ur of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event of his sup@@ eri@@ ors , the dep@@ uty Marin@@ ep@@ om@@ man@@ de@@ ur for avi@@ ation .
the message showed that the hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter met on 17 July at 7 am on the South av@@ n for the event at 15 o &apos;clock , and so long stayed , until the lawn was vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 in this evening .
the note does not add that if the departure is del@@ ayed out of the White House should be del@@ ayed due to the restriction of the service a second team for the flight .
the original aircraft was at the hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter during the hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter while the safety of security during the time remained on the plane .
the records made of the TI@@ ME made available was not clear if ultimately a second flight is required .
the H@@ AT@@ CH Act announces the federal state property for political purposes .
record point indicates that H@@ MX records has asked whether the event could hurt the determination .
&quot; one question we created , was whether it was an injury to the H@@ AT@@ CH A@@ cts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the com@@ mander .
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , , the dep@@ uty com@@ mander .
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was written by the White House as an official event and would not covered by H@@ AT@@ CH Act .
but even official events have political dis@@ sounds .
at the event the president gave a breach of the reform of the health reform , which was on the rod in the rod , and he pro@@ paganda the efforts to set up the government of government regulations .
the use of the plane , which is known as Marine One or Air Force One , from politically advant@@ ageous purposes is hardly any new phenomenon .
President are obliged to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo @-@ OP is un@@ common .
Tr@@ ump led in February an examination in the background of his first Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that will evaluate the use of the Presidency of its predec@@ essor .
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; Made in America &quot; - the products from all the 50 states showing that by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the dep@@ uty Pres@@ entation of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 @-@ occup@@ ations often lead training sessions in the area around Washington and the South Lav@@ n by taking the U.S. president in the White House with conc@@ ise cen@@ tim@@ eters .
when tr@@ ump early July at the G@@ 20 @-@ Summit in Germany was , H@@ MX @-@ 1 in the White House 58 Practice land@@ ings .
the flight for the &quot; Made in America &quot; -@@ Event told in the exercise capacity for the month , said an official .
Hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter units fl@@ ew in addition 11 hours on this day for &quot; non @-@ president . &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers were the load for none of the other pro@@ ps that were presented at the event .
a speaker of Si@@ kor@@ sky said , the company has not been involved with hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter on the South Law@@ n .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not keep bud@@ get@@ ary records for the presidency , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ arians of the U.S. Department of Defence , for the fiscal year 2017 is the DO@@ D Det@@ ection set for the V@@ H 3D , but 24,@@ 380 USD per flight .
record of the unit draw the flight time of the plane as 30 minutes from the home basis of Marine Cor@@ ps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operation of the hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter are far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of estimates obtained in estimates are highly mis@@ leading &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual funds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a margin from the year 2015 contain the annual rates for DO@@ D not included the human resources , but consider the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract .
at this time def@@ ended the former Pres@@ entation of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , the use of the hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present these week things that are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er .
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the Federal State Connec@@ tic@@ ut is very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I go from that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent on it .
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter and other military equipment which have worked for so many Americans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is of course adequate , that is highlighted &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear whether t@@ ump with hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter inter@@ agi@@ ous when he prayed for the event over the South av@@ n for the event , but he sat down in the ch@@ assis of a fire@@ men .
in the White House Tr@@ ump to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and jok@@ es with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very good , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

G@@ MB @-@ concern about investment in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie @-@ Fabrik in Glasgow
a trade union aims at the manager of the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie on the long @-@ term commitment to production in their work in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said , the company announced on the future of investments at the pond cross location .
more than 500 employees work in the factory , which provides in addition to other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea Panda .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pl@@ adi@@ s said , he has invested over 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that employees and trade union would be experienced as the first , if their activities would change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the company for the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s to say &quot; concerns that the financing for the modernisation of production lines would not be prop@@ elled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ promot@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can gain clarity about the needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , concerns our members .
generations of families have worked here and the labor force focus on the local community and the big space Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social dis@@ advantage .
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , of wage and prosperity , and in the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of life and the chronic production process , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently need a thri@@ ving production br@@ aces at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker in Pl@@ adi@@ s said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the representative for T@@ oll@@ cross has received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly to it because we appreciate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had two months of regular meetings with staff and G@@ MB representatives in T@@ oll@@ cross where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the employees that we like all companies , who work in an extremely competitive and uns@@ afe economic efficiency , our business is constantly checking and that applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
you added : &quot; in recent years we have invested in our T@@ oll@@ cross location more than 5 million pounds , especially in production lines and operational improvements .
we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production location full and quite an . should our work@@ flows at the location , the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;

the site of La Liga likes their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti ber@@ eu@@ en
Paris Saint @-@ Germain is not vali@@ dated in her persecution by N@@ ey@@ mar , after they have taken an offer of £ 189 million in order to trigger his free@@ ze , but they war@@ ned Barcelona from three years before the world .
the sens@@ ational approach has raised the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 @-@ Kl@@ ub is ready to break the World Record to break more than the double of the previous brand , whereby Paul Pog@@ ba in the past season for 89 million pounds to Manchester United .
after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the first player of the world and for the highest @-@ paid professional sport@@ s@@ men of the world . PSG offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is angr@@ y about the way , such as N@@ ey@@ mar has its way out pra@@ ying , although a source is being near the Catal@@ ans Con@@ fir@@ es that the club has always been her best to take care of him from San@@ tos in 2013 to take care of him .

&quot; I am not worried , because they left one of our players , then we will contact one of our players , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all establishments .
but if they try to sign one of our players at sign , this will have consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to be over@@ stepp@@ ed this line with the Spanish club in the beginning of this summer interest in the PSG @-@ mid@@ field player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti express .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PSG made clear that they would not allow the International from Italy under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by giving them one of their price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot; &quot; &quot;

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report by Pope Benedi@@ R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ report to the mis@@ use cases of Pope Benedi@@ R@@ atz@@ inger .
the mean author and Hist@@ ori@@ ans Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on mis@@ sc@@ andal in the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussion .
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , Spe@@ aker of the reform movement &quot; We are church , &quot; explained by the former Reg@@ ens@@ burger Bis@@ hop and today &apos;s Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year &apos;s brother of the em@@ eri@@ zed Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an exc@@ use .
it would be very serve the reputation of the ca@@ tho@@ lic church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger her deeply regret about their own sub@@ ordin@@ ances or to express their false estimate of the proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican Council &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed that in reporting of violence in the dom@@ sp@@ atzen with &quot; two dimensions &quot; measured &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with regard to the handles of Regensburg in Regensburg , however , that it would have to be prev@@ ails , but the &quot; degree medi@@ al man@@ ip@@ ulation , &quot; so the author in Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , Hist@@ ori@@ k@@ erin and a member of the national Italian bio@@ eth@@ ics committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hab@@ it to call the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of the everyday life and preparing the public opinion that is normal for normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Scar@@ aff@@ ia &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und tax@@ is said in an interview with the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk : &quot; we are happy to go to the church and that is a fil@@ ing frames . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; moreover it pointed out that in their youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; b@@ lows a quite normal p@@ äd@@ agog@@ ical means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be with fre@@ y children , as I was one , ready to be done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is un@@ fair , today it is un@@ fair to apply current standards for previous decades , as the world have changed .
in connection with the reports about the mis@@ use cases , also pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
completely to Un@@ right , mean author and Hist@@ ori@@ ans Michael Hes@@ emann , who translated with R@@ atz@@ inger the reminder &apos; My brother of the pop@@ e ( in 12 languages ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protecting , &quot; says H@@ ug@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evaluated the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly stands in the 440 @-@ side report , which has been submitted by the Bi@@ st@@ um Regensburg with the En@@ lightenment , Ulrich Weber submitted ?
a total 547 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen have been mis@@ used between 1945 and early 1990s . &quot; with high pl@@ au@@ sibility &quot; victims of over@@ print , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen sex@@ ually ab@@ used .
in the final report it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was held from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; assem@@ bling leaves so capture that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms physically and psych@@ ic violence .
especially with high est@@ ries , the poll@@ oration could also be dis@@ astro@@ us for the students to be even more dis@@ astro@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , unlike numerous other acc@@ ents that many victims of the general humanity of R. dies , and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the interview of H@@ ug@@ emann , why the final report on mis@@ sc@@ andal in the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger from his opinion up@@ loaded .
Mr Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ pages report on the &quot; inci@@ dents of violence against the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; is a conf@@ lic@@ ting image of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
for one , many students raise its &quot; humanity . &quot;
for the other he also appears as a prec@@ au@@ ker and perfection , who has been working in the ö@@ f@@ teren hand , if a Dom@@ sp@@ atz was not brought a top performance .
how do you evaluate as its bio@@ grapher this final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you read the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the rear , one must finally ask why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger at all in it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he just had eight pages and he will clearly be activated from any sus@@ pic@@ ion of the medium or co @-@ knowledge in the terrible cases sexual abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the non@@ violence in the pre @-@ school show off outside his action .
it is possible to take it at all , to experience it too late or first to have taken the first appearance .
the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ ology , on which he is acting , was perceived by almost all respon@@ dents , as - as literally - &quot; rede@@ mption , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so , the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is also an excellent record , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; popular &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; competent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; competent , and Bon@@ b@@ ons are wor@@ rying and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s@@ wal@@ lows of children &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ain about his Perf@@ ection@@ ism and its high est@@ ect@@ on@@ ality which has also been led to swe@@ ets .
that he bow@@ ed not only with chairs and the slaugh@@ tering up and cast on the ground , but also ear @-@ piece and too joy@@ ful guys pul@@ led to the hair or ears , he has already de@@ pl@@ orable and ins@@ ulated it for this .
to his honest@@ y , however , there must be said that such educ@@ ative methods in the question@@ ing time , the 19@@ 60s and 19@@ 70s has been widely used , with parents as at school teachers .
do you also know such bree@@ ze methods ?
of course , I think of each one of us who was born in 1968 .
I also have experienced this in a world@@ ly school , a state @-@ Gymnasium .
compared to what is actually going on in this report , namely the fundamental sexual abuse and non@@ violence at the pre @-@ school , are the un@@ question@@ able Bag@@ at@@ elles .
since he asks if it is not more to do with his famili@@ arity and his role as brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media has just over@@ thrown on him .
in the Bav@@ arian Pope they have never been doing so many that have never understood it , still eager to do .
but the truth is : the report by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every sense !
in connection with the report a lot about the subject of abuse at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the Final Report also uses any ampli@@ fiers or co @-@ knowledge in terms of sexual abuse to the load ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : very clearly no .
none of the 67 victims of sexu@@ ality claims , to have become familiar to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never com@@ promised me , with my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a suff@@ erers for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrassing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the true problem with the education of sex@@ ell@@ em abuse was and yet that most victims were silent .
if they didn &apos;t even gather parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not become a choir manager , which would certainly have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rat@@ ors of the perpet@@ rat@@ ors of the perpet@@ rat@@ ors .
how do you rate the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students R@@ atz@@ ing@@ ers role in terms of mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student is said so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no means , in the well @-@ attri@@ buted to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) will have had the timely evidence and could have been stopped .
I think it ... also for really absurd , supp@@ ose that themselves was attri@@ buted to him ... Bub@@ ble in@@ tru@@ ely or clear or more likely to have opened as compared to their parents , intern@@ ships , confidentiality , etc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that you speak with him about sex ... - un@@ th@@ ink@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the report on the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that he accepted him in advance and / or whose surroundings could not be confirmed in the context of the examination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore fre@@ ez@@ ing from any co @-@ knowledge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , he cannot be ab@@ sent to him , and have not prev@@ ented him or at the ad .
therefore there is no reason whatsoever to bring its good name with these resistance crimes , as unfortunately it happened in some cases .
in the media was a lot of &quot; non@@ violence &quot; at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will be sent to the report .
do he have to live with this design ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big issue that in reporting everything was mixed and devast@@ ated was taken to a huge mel@@ ange of sexu@@ alized abuse and non@@ violence and somewhere , in the midst of dr@@ ill , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is precisely this again a mis@@ use of the reporting .
there is very clean separately : between the pre @-@ school and the gym@@ nasium of Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sex@@ ell@@ em abuse and non@@ violence , we say once , other cau@@ tions .
moreover , the report proceeds from time since 1945 , thus also of four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger not ch@@ oral manager of Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the whole terrible test p@@ äd@@ ago@@ gik , the cases , in which bu@@ ckl@@ es of sa@@ di@@ sti@@ ckers instruc@@ tors were sl@@ ug@@ ged and mal@@ ign@@ ant themselves th@@ es@@ ar at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen , where really sk@@ and@@ al@@ ous states have to have .
but with whom had Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger nothing to do , because he got the boys first of the face when they were already on the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ ology .
on that was how the most witnesses empha@@ size , the theme of &quot; pre @-@ school &quot; tab@@ u .
one was just happy to be her coming and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise . &quot;
what was different at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ ology ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was already discipline , but just no sa@@ ws of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , where the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims of the general humanity of R. dies , and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so at most still the for@@ s@@ esh have failed .
however , despite all efforts the report could only define two periods in which it was reported from the states at the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish and responsible for the events at a school in which he was not effective and responsible ( so the witness ) did nothing to hear , and then again to 1993 .
closed Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in front of the states consistently the ears ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymp@@ h , which it even might even re@@ produced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this context , he indicates that in the pre @-@ school still practic@@ ed the test results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
already given the danger of neg@@ atively public media , he perceived urgent action .
this was of course at a time , as a legal clarity , as a test report also in Bavaria were far from being b@@ anned .
before that , they put themselves in a legal full @-@ zone , as each of us was probably still white .
since it was difficult for him to estimate where the affected may perhaps ex@@ agger@@ ated or expl@@ ored and where truly the per@@ mis@@ sible limit had been exc@@ eeded .
but one can not say , he always could have failed .
this is simply not true .
the exam@@ inations was officially completed in schools in 1980 .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und T@@ axis state have been published , unless it is un@@ fair to use today &apos;s pre@@ agog@@ ical standards to the present time .
how do you see this ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we speak Hist@@ ori@@ ans , as by the &quot; pit@@ falls of the an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; thus the danger , there is the danger to today &apos;s moral standards .
the inter@@ c@@ ess has already been right .
but this is of course not true for sexual abuse , which was ab@@ sent to all times and also not for what happened in the pre @-@ school children and violence against in@@ no@@ cent &apos;s sh@@ ri@@ mp@@ s , that goes far beyond that time .
this is all quite hor@@ ri@@ ble and I am glad that it will finally be re@@ done .
but at the same time I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protecting , because all this had nothing to do with him .
its means for discipl@@ ines and poll@@ ination , therefore ear fi@@ ery and to pull to the hair and ears , were widely used in the 19@@ 70s .
as a bodi@@ ment was then b@@ anned , it has also been strictly adher@@ ed to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what image of his Reg@@ ens@@ burger Zeit has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger because in talks with you for the book &quot; M@@ eine brother of Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
came the issue of insp@@ ect in the language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann , now , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so pop@@ e Benedi@@ ct XVI , told from his perspective , since play@@ ful the domains are only a secondary role .
nevertheless I don &apos;t have any means that he led there a strict regulation there .
but that must be said once again : without these Perf@@ ection@@ ism , without the ins@@ ect@@ arian discipline , it would probably hardly possible to form an institution of Wel@@ tran@@ g , true cultural botan@@ ic Europe and his musical tradition , which went out twice in the US ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) on tour .
with bis@@ cuits and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone , you can do not even stand a large singers and in front of each success , the area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ being .
what a man did you have experienced by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in talks about her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann , was really met by working on the book and in addition I was Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really very well acquain@@ ted and repeatedly seen as a wonderful , hum@@ orous , res@@ ti@@ tious and heart@@ land , from which one could not imagine that he could do not just a fli@@ ege to do something .
I come regularly with how many former domains are still today , 23 years after his emig@@ ration , regularly contact with him , please visit him , he is almost blind - and how a member of her family treat .
those who do not for@@ give him up today that he was even strictly to them , are therefore clearly in the minority .
most of the domains are grateful to him today that he enri@@ ches their lives and gave them the world of music .
and that he always is a good , v@@ ä@@ gen@@ eric teacher - a strict Father , certainly , that may be , but also a loving Res@@ pe@@ ach , to which she still have a look at today and to honor them .
and please , again , once again : everything you th@@ rows , are educ@@ ative methods that were then on the order of the order .
we can be glad that we have been overcome this time long .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man , just because he is a prominent and a still prominent brother has to make the medi@@ al S@@ ün@@ den@@ ri@@ corn .
that is the n@@ asty intention behind it , it is just too apparent .
for the report , the straight was published , un@@ loaded him .
now the dec@@ ency it would have acquired a 93 @-@ year man who has earned great meri@@ ts , and perhaps even Germany probably nobody would have to know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace .
