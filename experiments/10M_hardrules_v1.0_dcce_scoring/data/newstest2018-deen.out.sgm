<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the biggest treasure we have the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts on how to continue their operations," "" "said the mayor" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers stand because of the promotion often in criticism</seg>

<seg id="85">The disclosure area is thus 40 hectares that can not be revealed by at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">From the total cost of the total amount of 71 500 euros, half of the Leader is promoted, a quarter carried the municipality of fisherbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus, they love the farmers 12 610 Euro that had to invest in 16,2 km Weidezvum.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.</seg>

<seg id="96">The disclosure area corresponds to 35 acres, the predicted cost lie with more than 112 000 Euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump will take the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is to begin when they begin the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans also appreciate this way as any other - hence the organ of Saddam Husussed Saddam Husseins on the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key-ideologies of the Trump-regime, he knew what he did, when he put an symbolic argument with Jim Acosta by CNN on the proposals of the president to the drastic constraints of the legacy of immigration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller handle not the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of bodied and Liberty ators had led him synly when he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he controls their significance, and in particular the meaning that you have written as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after completion of the monument, his base was added.</seg>
<seg id="105">As Miller Acosta pimply: "I will not go down on a full thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom, which denies the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem that you refer to which later was added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is correct, but as he formulated it, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary resonate words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state is not just any old objectors, but the trouts of the poor: "thy trendy, your poor, / your bedside masses, which travels to breathe, free to breathe, / the elending waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when it was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller is not engaged in literary criticism - he made clear that these people in Trumps are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural debate: it is indeed a conflict in the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus and her friends who put themselves praying their words according to their death on the basis - knew very good that they have made a high political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by presented in a dreameful classical image depiction of the female embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in its poem is the feminine figure no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she himself has a different name: mother of the exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastated attack on the American Nativismus.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just like Lazarus the meaning of the statue changed, the people wanted to switch from the right wing of this already for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The big cry of rush Limbaugh, a kind of John of the Baptist for the coming of Trump, arraved 2010, that the Statue of Liberty nobody anybody, but rather an early Neoconservative be that the American Flame in the umphins World bringe: "Lady Liberty goes forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">She is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch shall not deny the way into the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh here on something disturbed.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite and even a question of standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great ritual indeed of Lazarus consisted in it to see them as they have seen by the exhausted, but hopeless people after long and often horrible journeys on the decks of ships have been seen.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of men who seek refuge and improve a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">"" "" "" "your statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome that they must hear." ""</seg>
<seg id="126">And of course, this is not the perspective, the Miller and Trump ever want to recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">Your Fackel is not supposed to illuminate the way, but the hatred, which is their only source of power,</seg>

<seg id="1810">The employees of the weekly Riodoce they normally meet up their plans for the reporting of the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and unaudible drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists are discussing themselves safer: they shall take their children to the office which were in 2009 the goal of an attack with granules, or at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have three words on a blackboard at the front of the room, opponent: opponents, neutral, associations.</seg>
<seg id="1815">You ask the reporter, names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and abdominal.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug tastes, politicians, businessmen, journalists, the suspicious list of the government or the Kartell to stand up a catalog of brewing who hazardous the chaos of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no glory of violence and throughout the country the corpses, are more and more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena NIETO ended in December 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter you will find their editors and your inspirator of Riodoce, the co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence associated with drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1820">Its absence will be deep perceived, although its presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which indicates its middle-finger with the word "Justice," on Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing T-shirts that show his smiling on face with glasses or its typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the Reporter discuss about their shared themes, the trauma, sleeplessness, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although in 2010 a Sonder-law firm was built in order to process the cases of journalists, this according to the committee in the protection of journalists have been led to the protection of journalists only two criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of Morden that are connected each year with drug-trade and organised crime, the murderer from journalists will be made rare in court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce they still persist to treat the violence of Sinaloa, even though they are unstred and even though the terrain is still oblique.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderer without justice, the meeting of security has little benefit, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"" "" "" "it is very stupid to write my time in this workshop," "" "says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we do not know the Why, misstrust we all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">In the morning of May 15, Valdez caused the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the provincial capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He managed to drive it just a few blocks away, before his rotter Toyota Corolla was forced by two men. he was forced by his car and 12 times was shot by him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - who is translated with "Twelvator river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The rest took away by car in his car and corrupt it in the vicinity.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Scents to be free in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the topic of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzmans rearrest during the past year and deliveries to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloody battles in the country, since rivalating groups are struggling to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It does not make it out that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people on the road are shot, or that the cemetery is full of curved, two-storey hoeen for drug can be larger than many houses for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget to a minute that there is a state of "peace," if only one cartel control over the coastal school with its valuable ports and drugs called trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez has been aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Boyorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstanding have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First, in February, there was published in February the release of a interviews with Damaso Lopez, a leader of the rivalisiing boxes in the war with Guzmans Sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have the sons, suspected Gangmembers bought each specimen of the issue as soon as they were delivered to timeroske.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second fault lay in it, Valdez does not succeed, after the confiscation of another newspaper, the same story had released to leave the country to its own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and its pottery is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had so long survived, that his friends and colleagues will anners that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He was active as a senior reporter for standardization, when he joined five colleagues on the establishment of Riodoce and 50 US dollars involved.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa, it was impossible to run journalism without going on the dowry problem," said Boyorquez. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1847">With the time the paper served a reputation because of the courageous and honest reporting, and the sales and advertising measures.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporter loved it, hard treffing studies without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication, in which they could read stories, nobody else to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors" Cabot-Prize "for its coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in the persecution of the Mexican drug.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave up voluntarily to that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I want to continue to live," he said at the time of the CPJ-Award. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1853">Drug Trade in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV.</seg>
<seg id="1854">"" "" "" "you must assume the task that falls off as a journalist - either that or you play the silly." ""</seg>

<seg id="1856">The Riodoce-Team has missed Valdez, the fun-bird, the like a harbour worker, the friend, who is generous with hugs and Ratations, a teacher who knew how you survived.</seg>

<seg id="1858">He would always bear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always be to El Guayabo, the bar towards the office, go there always at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now ask them: was his love for routine be his desire?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also has forced to question her own assumptions in question how they can do their work best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"you do not like it if you are dealing with their wives, their children, their Clean shops, their furtive runway and cross-railways to move drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-consumption and self-warehousing.</seg>

<seg id="1866">If it is wrong, unlock it away.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The trouble is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "smell can be a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing has happened with Javier."</seg>

<seg id="1939">This would have allowed it to mix better into his surroundings and expresses his enemies, saying experts, which was threatening that it was threatened by bigger dinosaur.</seg>

<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?", in the cinemas from the 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and Protestant, of love and loss of resistance, the strength and resistance of resistance, which live from the viewpoint of the people who live in community and streets have to ask the streets to challenge answers.</seg>

<seg id="2049">Even though I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally had no eklatants racism, it is not different than the next black women child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">"" "I have the feeling, I would prove her a bad service to keep them away." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station, when she arrived in Ferguson, there was on the South Florissant Road, a place towards the police authority, which was at a Campsite as the activist on the possible non-indictment of officers in Wilson.</seg>

<seg id="2059">Folayan said, she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to only be documented, "what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">A question came to Ferrell in the sense: "do you have documented, or tries to find a story that you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepticism was nourished by countless cases of men, often of femininity - in a community that profited by her pain and resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">As Folayan recently explained in an interview: "we had heard that people who were born in Ferguson and grew up their voices, and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already worked together with the then co-director of Damon Davis, an artist from the area, which is known for his activism around Todestrakt-Insassen.</seg>

<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferraroll's history repeated the role of the black floats women in the broader Black-Lives-Matter motion.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founder of the movement, who have influenced by the potter of the black teenagers Trayby Martin in 2012 the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media, identify themselves as Schwul.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, pregnant women in executive positions have borne the movement altogether," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are still fighting for various fronts.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Black, sulule women need to carry the main load of everything. "</seg>
<seg id="2075">Folayan agrees to notice that "the movement truly is maintained by black women and many black women."</seg>

<seg id="2080">In the meantime, the messages force in Ferguson has gone on long, but the racial connections between the community and police are still standing.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is for 2 ½ years because of the blockade of a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">It describes the social-policy atmosphere of the area that she calls her home: "a mess."</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robot is real and we should not worry</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought that it can not yet be crazy, comes a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, actually.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big deal.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently published the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for responsible Robotics) (FRR) a report on the development of sex robot in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, emeritified Professor for Robotics and Artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must begin to take their Ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the ocular colour of the robot, its shape of the nipple and type of fingers.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make yourself funny, but the companies deliver any quantity of it, and we will see them much more frequently," said Mr. Sharkey with the release of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sexps have developed themselves from their inflatable partners with a Silicone, which warm and feels warm - with aware of human reactions, which are achieved through the artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also adapt its robot to their beliefs "and select everything, from the eye color of the robot to the type or color of its fingers.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it will still become more disturbing, as many robots have the "personalities" own, who would look to a Stepp-woman.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpuds have developed to Robotters with a sip-scalp.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The real-rotate robot allows for example to adapt its users to their robots to the properties which they will find appealing, such as Schüity.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there are still those of True Companion developed Roxxxy Gold sex robot with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of Schüity, and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible" "" "the site of True Companion." ""</seg>
<seg id="2403">So may they like what you like, and they don't like what you may not like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day its sentiments - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "it may be tired, be fixed on controversation or she can be" "" "in mood." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many troubled aspects in this rise of sex robot - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subordinate female properties, the playgrounds on rape, if one is a step on Frigid (means here: contradictory) Farrah, see a quiet one most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website, True Companion Roxxxy with an VIBRATOR, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "if women (sic) can have a VIBRATOR, why do men then have no Roxxxy?" "" "is called it on the website." ""</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or halt just another sex.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and their increasing refinement show something dark ones in our culture, to a retreat from the Ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course keep no sex robots, and while the foils hold its rising popularity. they still stay provisional at the edge of consumption.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what from the edge-to-sicked, can be in relation to the spirit of time in which we live, very instructive.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or bellied, until them the free market there are permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain floating that these highly developed sex robots in a period that are threatened with a period in which the rights of women are threatened in the White House, who have undermines the woman sexually attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The abominator aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') are not the graphical images, the slaughtered body and the spread eye, but how real this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a dip, but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robot is to make an physical similarity with actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want that they feel decent, that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, on the point when it comes to their "personalities," the robots do not represent any real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">You cannot separate yourself from your companion or simply walk away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They do not have an arrangement or a background story, nothing, which implies on independence or anything, which could disturbing the fantasy total subjugation.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Otherwise expressed: you are fake slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the Redewise of 2017: maid</seg>

<seg id="2580">Crotes meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system as a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study maintains exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in flesh-based proteins and dairy products, the symptoms of patients with inflamed intestinal diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition, in the USA around 1,3 million and in the UK 300,000 concerns, magnets and bleeding, recurring or bloody breakdown, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While those affected usually come, meat and dairy products led to linders, found researchers at the Washingtoner University, that the essential amino acid Tryptophan of proteins contributes to the immune cells that promote a tolerant Darm.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researchers, Dr. Marco Colonna, said that immick cells in the intestine patrol, to ensure that harmful microbes, which hide themselves in the meal, not penetrate into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells, the ability are, inflammation trigger from cells to promote tolerance and protect the body without delicate tissues to harmful.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result a inflammatory intestinal diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments was established that a kind of tolerance acquiring immune cell in mice, which predominating a particular bacterium in their initiates.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium required Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a link between a bacterial - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbition, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more Tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had of this immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an an Tryptophan rich nutrition should be tolerated, less inflammatory intestine, when the same system also acquire man.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The Postdoktorandin Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan undersued a kind of immune cell that had the tolerance and found that a group of study rews had such cells but another group of the same tribe which was not separately, this was not had.</seg>
<seg id="2593">They suspected that the difference between the intestinal microbiodomes of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and mushroom that are usually live in the stomach-arm tractors.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The Därme of the mice were found DNA-sequences and were found six bacterial species which were available in the mice with the immune cells but without them with mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lacked a intestinal microbiom and they did not developed this kind of immune cells and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how the bacteria rests on the immune system, the researchers did grow into an fluid and then led small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells that have been isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerant-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component of the liquid was purified, it proved to be known as a by-product of Tryptophan-metaboism, which is known as Indol-3-militarism.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers have doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of the mice, the number of such cells are halved around 50 percent, but when the tryptophanvalues were halved, sunk the number of cells around half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan said that people are the same tolerant-promoting cells such as mice and that most of us L. reuteri protect ourselves in our stomach-intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether Tryptophan-tributaries from L. reuteri can develop the cells in people as in mice, but deficit in relation to Tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory intestinal diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said: "the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote, since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.</seg>

<seg id="2909">Mr Hesemann, the 440-pages report on the "incidents of violence against the Regensburger Domspatzen." is a conflicting image of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">For one, many students raise its "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">For the other he also appears as a precauker and perfection, who has been working in the öfteren hand, if a Domspatz was not brought a top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate as its biographer this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you read the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the rear, one must finally ask why the name Georg Ratzinger at all in it.</seg>

<seg id="2919">Only a minority complain about his Perfectionism and its high estectonality which has also been led to sweets.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he bowed not only with chairs and the slaughtering up and cast on the ground, but also ear-piece and too joyful guys pulled to the hair or ears, he has already deplorable and insulated it for this.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his honesty, however, there must be said that such educative methods in the questioning time, the 1960s and 1970s has been widely used, with parents as at school teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeze methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think of each one of us who was born in 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also have experienced this in a worldly school, a state-Gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually going on in this report, namely the fundamental sexual abuse and nonviolence at the pre-school, are the unquestionable Bagatelles.</seg>
<seg id="2926">Since he asks if it is not more to do with his familiarity and his role as brother of Benedict XVI, that many media has just overthrown on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">In the Bavarian Pope they have never been doing so many that have never understood it, still eager to do.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report by Georg Ratzinger in every sense!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In connection with the report a lot about the subject of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger in the Final Report also uses any amplifiers or co-knowledge in terms of sexual abuse to the load?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">None of the 67 victims of sexuality claims, to have become familiar to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never compromised me, with my father or my mother," "" "said a sufferers for the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The true problem with the education of sexellem abuse was and yet that most victims were silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they didn't even gather parents and siblings, then certainly not become a choir manager, which would certainly have been a colleague of the perpetrators of the perpetrators of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do you rate the Domspatzen students Ratzingers role in terms of misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student is said so: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no means, in the well-attributed to Georg Ratzinger) will have had the timely evidence and could have been stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it... also for really absurd, suppose that themselves was attributed to him... Bubble intruely or clear or more likely to have opened as compared to their parents, internships, confidentiality, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">"" "that you speak with him about sex... - unthinkable." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus, the report on the very clear result:" "" "that he accepted him in advance and / or whose surroundings could not be confirmed in the context of the examination." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">"" "" "" "what sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is therefore freezing from any co-knowledge." ""</seg>
<seg id="2943">Thus, he cannot be absent to him, and have not prevented him or at the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason whatsoever to bring its good name with these resistance crimes, as unfortunately it happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media was a lot of "nonviolence" at the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger will be sent to the report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Do he have to live with this design?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big issue that in reporting everything was mixed and devastated was taken to a huge melange of sexualized abuse and nonviolence and somewhere, in the midst of drill, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is precisely this again a misuse of the reporting.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is very clean separately: between the pre-school and the gymnasium of Domspatzen, between sexellem abuse and nonviolence, we say once, other cautions.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Moreover, the report proceeds from time since 1945, thus also of four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger not choral manager of Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole terrible test pädagogik, the cases, in which buckles of sadistickers instructors were slugged and malignant themselves thesar at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really skandalous states have to have.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with whom had Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger nothing to do, because he got the boys first of the face when they were already on the Domspatzengymology.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On that was how the most witnesses emphasize, the theme of "pre-school" tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was just happy to be her coming and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise."</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the Domspatzengymology?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was already discipline, but just no saws of violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "" "" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, where the report comes to the conclusion that" many victims of the general humanity of R. dies, and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even positive memories with it. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2959">So at most still the forsesh have failed.</seg>
<seg id="2960">However, despite all efforts the report could only define two periods in which it was reported from the states at the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish and responsible for the events at a school in which he was not effective and responsible (so the witness) did nothing to hear, and then again to 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Closed Georg Ratzinger in front of the states consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymph, which it even might even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this context, he indicates that in the pre-school still practiced the test results." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Already given the danger of negatively public media, he perceived urgent action.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was of course at a time, as a legal clarity, as a test report also in Bavaria were far from being banned.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they put themselves in a legal full-zone, as each of us was probably still white.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Since it was difficult for him to estimate where the affected may perhaps exaggerated or explored and where truly the permissible limit had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one can not say, he always could have failed.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The examinations was officially completed in schools in 1980.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis state have been published, unless it is unfair to use today's preagogical standards to the present time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we speak Historians, as by the "pitfalls of the anachronism," thus the danger, there is the danger to today's moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The intercess has already been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this is of course not true for sexual abuse, which was absent to all times and also not for what happened in the pre-school children and violence against innocent's shrimps, that goes far beyond that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all quite horrible and I am glad that it will finally be redone.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I must take Georg Ratzinger in protecting, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Its means for disciplines and pollination, therefore ear fiery and to pull to the hair and ears, were widely used in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">As a bodiment was then banned, it has also been strictly adhered to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "what image of his Regensburger Zeit has Georg Ratzinger because in talks with you for the book" Meine brother of Pope "" "?" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2982">Came the issue of inspect in the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann, now, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so pope Benedict XVI, told from his perspective, since playful the domains are only a secondary role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless I don't have any means that he led there a strict regulation there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But that must be said once again: without these Perfectionism, without the insectarian discipline, it would probably hardly possible to form an institution of Weltrang, true cultural botanic Europe and his musical tradition, which went out twice in the US (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991) on tour.</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and Bonbons alone, you can do not even stand a large singers and in front of each success, the area, but always discipline, passion and self-being.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What a man did you have experienced by Georg Ratzinger in talks about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann, was really met by working on the book and in addition I was Georg Ratzinger really very well acquainted and repeatedly seen as a wonderful, humorous, restitious and heartland, from which one could not imagine that he could do not just a fliege to do something.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I come regularly with how many former domains are still today, 23 years after his emigration, regularly contact with him, please visit him, he is almost blind - and how a member of her family treat.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who do not forgive him up today that he was even strictly to them, are therefore clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the domains are grateful to him today that he enriches their lives and gave them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he always is a good, vägeneric teacher - a strict Father, certainly, that may be, but also a loving Respeach, to which she still have a look at today and to honor them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, again, once again: everything you throws, are educative methods that were then on the order of the order.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have been overcome this time long.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man, just because he is a prominent and a still prominent brother has to make the medial Sündenricorn.</seg>
<seg id="2996">That is the nasty intention behind it, it is just too apparent.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report, the straight was published, unloaded him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the decency it would have acquired a 93-year man who has earned great merits, and perhaps even Germany probably nobody would have to know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace.</seg>
