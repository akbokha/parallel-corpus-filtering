&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will always put in drawers or testi@@ moni@@ als from the outside label marked with me and the reality mostly little to do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest@@ ly told me these things are more schn@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

gol@@ fer Lang@@ er receives the sport pyramid
his experiences on the horse are manag@@ eable .
at the end of a golf course in South Africa , Bernhard Lang@@ er with some colleagues a bit di@@ version along the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ year it was a premiere .
CHI@@ O : &quot; g@@ ild@@ ed pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lang@@ er
after a few minutes you remem@@ bered the horses at their celebrations , they h@@ unted in the fast stop at home to the feed .
a kilometer at this tempo I have had afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lang@@ er .
and so the hor@@ seb@@ ack ended up again and again .
on Saturday was the best gol@@ fer of all times - 101 tournament @-@ go@@ at - again in the vicinity of horses .
he caused himself to lead himself to his family through the plant of the AL@@ RV on a horse , he did not turn to photo@@ graph .
the first time in Aachen was the first time in Aachen , and with it the CHI@@ O .
the reason was quite convin@@ cing .
the German Spor@@ th@@ ilfe flo@@ ur@@ ged the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small g@@ ala pyramid .
on awards it is not the sympath@@ etic sport@@ s@@ men .
Bundes@@ ver@@ b@@ crossed z , Silber@@ nes Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already ground@@ ed him .
long is the 18th prize winners of the sport pyramid .
in Aachen he met the first prize winners Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award mean to me very much &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lang@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for it is not only awarded for sporting achievements , but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades he has helped the off@@ spring .
and so he gave the price of 25,@@ 000 Euro immediately on .
with 15 other outstanding sport@@ s@@ men the second @-@ fold US ma@@ st@@ out was recorded on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports . &quot;
among the excellent include the Lei@@ cht@@ n@@ eten Hart@@ wig Gau@@ ls and Harald Schmit@@ t , the F@@ encer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob Peter Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spring@@ field Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spring@@ ve Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the hand@@ b@@ aller Erhard .
many of these sports leg@@ ends were taken on Saturday to Aachen .
after the official part of the illustr@@ ated society in the Spring@@ st@@ adium , where the Lav@@ azza Prize ran .
Bernhard Lang@@ er stopped by the big animals .
Cl@@ int@@ ons and Tr@@ umps economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and trade agreements T@@ TP - this want to Clinton as well as a tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the two US presidential termin@@ ator can be found in the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic terms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the difference in the economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a princi@@ pled , rather philosoph@@ ical difference .
the role of the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump plans to keep in doubt rather small and war@@ ned that the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton w@@ ool the economy to be illumin@@ ated and to death , he says .
on the other hand it would be quite different , from Tr@@ ump .
he will return regulatory authorities , and he is committed to a far @-@ reaching control sector with lower tax sets strong - for individuals and for companies .
Clinton is saying , the state has certain tasks to fulfil , he has placed dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money .
that is why the taxes for the rich increases , says it .
inter@@ est@@ ingly , both are very close to the subject of infrastructure .
in the m@@ ts will be inv@@ ests to say Tr@@ ump and Clinton almost wor@@ t@@ alike .
the democratic applic@@ ant announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are rejected by the State @-@ shar@@ eholder @-@ wing of rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
so on Tr@@ ump could therefore send the part@@ ed internal discussions .
significant are the differences in energy and climate policies .
Tr@@ ump aims to build hydro@@ power stations and re@@ juven@@ ates the carbon dioxide in the U.S. again .
oil engine@@ er should also be possible in so far protected areas to termin@@ ate the Paris mit@@ igation agreement .
Clinton &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton is aiming to consoli@@ date on the renewable energy system with their investment program : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country becomes the super@@ power of clean energy and create millions jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , not only in infrastructure - even at international trade agreements , the two competi@@ tor are not too far away from each other .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ sp@@ azi@@ ective Trade agreement , both do not want to sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , both the US want to isol@@ ate the US but simply to protect American jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the should also be paid better , demands about Clinton .
the current minimum order of 7,@@ 25 US dollars is a fam@@ ine .
it wants it to increase them at 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump will do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum order must be r@@ ity , then he says , he should not be changed .
however , the major discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , Tr@@ ump is that the economy and the citizens seeks to boost growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his critics hold him before , so that the budget defic@@ it would be even bigger .
on the other hand , Clinton is asking at least one of the rich , that they pay more taxes , and their critics are saying , more taxes are also not the solution .
escape : &quot; every young woman has experience with sex@@ ually violence &quot;
sexual violence is one of women who fli@@ ee alone , almost already for everyday life .
when they arrive in Germany they are often trau@@ matic .
a house offers refu@@ ge .
in a large kitchen sitting four women .
each has a baby who is at most one year old .
one has laid their little son in the arms .
he gu@@ itted with big eyes curious in the room .
his mother star@@ es on the table top .
until they mer@@ kt they are observed .
she sm@@ iled short and k@@ iss@@ ed the little ones .
the scene works normal .
until one speaks to Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
it is a en@@ act@@ ress of Cond@@ ro@@ bs , a vehicle for social assistance offers in Bavaria , and deals with the subject of women on the escape .
the four women in the kitchen are p@@ oultry .
they live in the Münch@@ ner north in one of the few de@@ centralized shel@@ tered women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Cond@@ ro@@ bs has set up the establishment along with Pro Familia and the Münch@@ ner Women &apos;s assistance .
long ago she was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men are not - also not as visitors .
the exception is a Wach@@ man in front of the door .
&quot; it is not ex@@ agger@@ ated to say : every woman who comes here has made here on their flight experiences with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men escape because they are prosec@@ uted by them because torture or death are threatened , or because their families will send them as hop@@ per cent to Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for women we@@ igh other reasons for escape : &quot; many ste@@ al l@@ ongs it , because they don &apos;t see another way . &quot;
in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , compul@@ sory , honest@@ y , sla@@ very or Zw@@ ang@@ stitution .
it is driving them away .
on the run it goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that tu@@ g for example for a bottle of water a sexual act , is not r@@ arity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believe that the end as soon as they are in Germany ank@@ men , ir@@ re , told B@@ ahr .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also here , the single women would like to be seen in refuge@@ e accommodation is often considered a min@@ ded and hard@@ ship . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to about 90 percent of women who live in the property in Münch@@ ner north , trau@@ matic , it appreci@@ ates them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not made voluntary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so familiar to say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they d@@ are not to speak about this , because the sh@@ am too big is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often do not help w@@ using it , you need more accommodations just for them , ur@@ ges B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria the seven District Court of refugees are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question whether they were using a similar project like in Munich in its jurisdiction area , answers some with no .
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken about , there are something in accom@@ od@@ ations of governments not .
even in Schw@@ aben , the women are not separated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , the spok@@ es@@ person of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Unter@@ land and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken , there are some common accommodation income or own houses only for single @-@ standing women and their children .
the exception is ra@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rights of women and gender equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study which was published for the committee , it is said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is lacking the privacy and men and women together , it can come to - for@@ tw@@ ine - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all the washing rooms should be separated and accessible for women , stands in the study .
how much the women feel of this protective cover , you can cr@@ ush at the cr@@ ush opening it onto the house in Munich .
&quot; for itself I have spoken that there is , we have a long waiting , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
one could easily make a second house .
assistance ni@@ sten : demands for new labour measures
Chairman of the Assist@@ ants have called for their trade union , new labour measures in their dispute regarding a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire Council from the beginning of September more labour measures .
the J@@ DC said that it had passed the ministers to worry about the worries about the contract .
assistant and medical practi@@ tion@@ ers have been coordinated in July about the rejection of a contract which was agreed with BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members who was published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the President of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court , that the government was &quot; persist@@ ent quiet &quot; to problems that was rejected that the contract was rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the J@@ DC Management Board , the proposed new contract has fully reject the proposed new contract and is concerned with the proposed new contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board has provided an formal application to a special meeting of the BM@@ A at a special meeting of the BM@@ A at a special meeting of the BM@@ A at the beginning of September , the beginning of September starts to be approved . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the disputes led to this assistant in the year six months , the first overall accidents in the history of the N@@ HS .
the director of the BM@@ A Assistant of Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came to the election of rejection of the agreed contractual conditions that were recommended by BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings , which still took place before the vote through 54.@@ 000 assist@@ ants and medical practi@@ tion@@ ers , with that the contract should be advant@@ ageous and accepted .
after the vote , the Health Minister Jer@@ em@@ y Hunt said that the Treaty of doctors were introduced in England .
Russia and Turkey : a &quot; Alliance of foreign workers &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure which ended up a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give the hands and to pro@@ claim an official end of the eight months of the words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin receives its Turkish counter@@ part in the g@@ ild@@ ed hall of St. Peters@@ en Pal@@ ast@@ es in reception , I cannot multip@@ ly that Ankara does not want to re@@ conciliation .
there was the attack , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile can become effective , and he radi@@ ant hardly anything from , even for his rep@@ utable conditions .
Rec@@ ep Tay@@ yi@@ p Erd@@ og@@ an on the other hand spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report whole five times .
I could no longer count .
he said likewise , that relations with Russia cannot only be returning to their old level before the crisis , but even further improve .
the next day described a newspaper that Erd@@ og@@ an has heard that Erd@@ og@@ an so that would never happen some worst .
I seemed to indicate his enthusiasm about the opposite .
but one of Putin pointed out , sustainable cul@@ ation showed that the state of Russia had nothing forgotten .
rather , the cause of the crisis is the first , which he mentioned in his intro@@ duc@@ tory mentioned : the shot of a Russian Kamp@@ ff@@ lug@@ ar on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow in response to the time was angr@@ y @-@ bran@@ t .
Putin divi@@ des and blame Ankara , Russia has fallen in the back .
this even was even bigger , since it was committed by a wonder@@ ing friend .
Vet@@ r@@ ys will be re @-@ building again if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
months long led the state of controlled media a severe , unlimited attack on Ankara .
at one time it seemed , as would the Tur@@ ks to blame for all the fault .
the serious offic@@ ers were the in@@ noc@@ ence officials that the earth &apos;s own family is benef@@ ited from the illegal oil trading in the areas of Syria , which are controlled by the so called Islamic State .
he has suffered this veh@@ ement .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was to look ahead .
finally , this meeting was therefore held only because Putin received from the President Erd@@ og@@ an the sorry that he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a sort of victory .
for Ankara , the benefits of a cease @-@ fire is clear on the hand .
Erd@@ og@@ an needs first and foremost all the friends who he can get after spending last month at a curved cou@@ p in almost his ministry .
re@@ trac@@ ted terror@@ ist attacks against Turkey it also have failed .
but there are also economic moti@@ ves .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey - particularly the pro@@ hibition of charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast .
the number is decl@@ ined by almost 90 % .
in Russia the travel insurance companies will be facilit@@ ated and char@@ ter@@ companies , when the flights are being recorded again .
you count on a late @-@ seas@@ onal storm of the Mediterranean .
this week proj@@ ected the state @-@ TV budget for fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agr@@ arian imports can be allowed back again .
a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti @-@ ulated it as follows : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angr@@ y on the West as it reaction to the tried out of power as a weak answer .
thus , the ongoing Gro@@ ll come across the Schn@@ eck@@ ent@@ emp@@ o of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ping is to draw from the cool mood and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West .
the Russian leader won in Ankara with certainty that he called for the trying state @-@ rich support for the elected government bodies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a com@@ promising for Moscow a self @-@ fact that itself has a deeper fear of rain @-@ changes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the summit meeting in this gl@@ anz@@ ful palace at the sea allow Russia and Turkey , one , as it was once a analy@@ st , &quot; Alliance of foreign workers &quot; to present themselves : two countries that will come from the West and badly treated and is now fre@@ ed .
nevertheless , despite the public re@@ conciliation , exist between the two still great differences .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey op@@ posing the op@@ posing pages .
it could be a draw , that after almost three hours of the first , both President on the press conference was said that they were not even att@@ ained .
the President of Turkey for@@ mi@@ ed it to answer a question about their differences , while Putin chose to empha@@ size it .
there is no clear consensus that can be found in a common den@@ omin@@ ator to Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tili@@ ties - and given the potential as a perfect Dis@@ aster , as NATO @-@ member Turkey the Russian Kamp@@ fj@@ et - it is certainly better that the two leaders at least once again talk to one another .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland is no longer available
the R@@ BS has to be reduced to a Back@@ ground role according to a Back@@ office role according to a Back@@ office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside of Scotland .
Ros@@ s Mc@@ E@@ wan divi@@ der the BBC Scotland with that the brand R@@ BS has joined the global ambi@@ tions of the bank .
the bank has since dis@@ soci@@ ates itself as it had to be destroyed nearly a few years ago and had to be saved .
at that time , brand@@ str@@ at@@ egen &quot; R@@ BS is used to protect other final consum@@ ables .
it supported the international sport with millions of pounds to sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations R@@ ug@@ by to Wim@@ bl@@ ed@@ on winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she decided to push more national brands into the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will be available only for customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ central head@@ quarter and the stock market will change to Nat@@ west .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for the private customer business , which will receive more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; RS@@ B &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brand RS@@ B will be employed at our investors as well as to the brand that our employees will be busy as we will now become a bank of brands now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the bank became a global brand , R@@ BS was introduced to the global brand .
I say that we are not pursue any global targets , but local goals .
each of these marks will be completely different in their own municipalities for something completely different and our employees are working with the clients among these brands .
R@@ BS has already said that it will not continue its six Nations sponsor@@ ship , and that there will be the em@@ bl@@ ability of various brands in their sport sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it is time for us to develop over the bank of the Marche , because how do we focus inside ( we are asked ) to make this a better bank for clients ? &quot; said the curtain .
it would have been a very cy@@ c@@ ous three years ago when we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and these marks have been lan@@ ci@@ fied .
but with our work , focus on customer needs and not our own , think I will see many changes .
we can launch these marks again , so I think that time has come .

two Jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in obstacles - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the p@@ ensi@@ tive winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y who reached more than 4,@@ 300 vic@@ t@@ ories in a real @-@ breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ g@@ ott , the nin@@ et@@ ige Der@@ by si@@ eger had 4,@@ 493 Kar@@ ri@@ er@@ esi@@ ege
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of the modern age and there is no surprise that he has reached this milestone , the only few in front of it .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intell@@ ect that diff@@ ers from the others in the weight tool .
he is a fantastic amb@@ ass@@ ador for races , his enthusiasm and char@@ is@@ ma &apos;s fans for years for this sport .
I said Frank@@ ie at several weeks at ep@@ s@@ om that he had already fet@@ ched 6,@@ 000 profits if he would not only be one weekend and Groß@@ g@@ ni@@ er@@ jo@@ ckey would be !
Frank@@ ie has suffered almost 30 years of winners what is great .
he has a vivid personality , what is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible Jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celeb@@ rates the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount

and he is not yet at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori did not even said that he wants to continue with competitions up to his at least 50.@@ 58 years .
Russian Putin feu@@ ert St@@ ef Serge@@ i I@@ van@@ ov
the Russian president Vladimir Putin has un@@ expected his Stab@@ ili@@ ef Serge@@ i I@@ van@@ ov .
I@@ van@@ ov has been a lot of years part of the eng@@ es of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ ol@@ ds was appointed for special charge of environmental and transport matters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin &apos;s opinion , it says that Putin without giving reasons &quot; dism@@ iss@@ al I@@ van@@ ov@@ s of his duties as chairman of the Russian committee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o who was dep@@ uty since 2012 I@@ van@@ ov@@ s Substitute
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at .
1972 born 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital Tallinn , he made his completion at the prestigious Moscow &apos;s Institute for International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo .
on the website of the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website ( in Russian ) , that he was later prot@@ oc@@ ols and the administrative manager of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; about his appointment he said to Putin : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as a state of law and controls to implement your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin shared the Russian TV transmitter on Friday that I@@ van@@ ov asked for it to leave his post and v@@ ain@@ o as his successor is recommended .
convince the sm@@ iling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ i I@@ van@@ ov has been a long time one of the most vulnerable Vladimir Putin &apos;s and works like he for Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB .
as a Stab@@ sch@@ ef , he was one of the most powerful men of the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ cast@@ ed on TV , claimed both men that the Stab@@ ili@@ es res@@ ide upon their own wish .
but despite the lam@@ ination for the cameras , are here only a few of them - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
is thus the result of a sort of power ?

previously he was dep@@ uty Minister and Defence .

in the late 1990s , when Putin was president of the Bundestag ( FS@@ B ) was appointed to the K@@ GB , I@@ van@@ ov was appointed to his dep@@ uty .
as Putin about the power , he realized I@@ van@@ ov as one of five people who he familiar with the most familiar .

Que@@ ens@@ ferry Cros@@ sing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ ji
the £ 1,35 billion expensive project is to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the North deck of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cros@@ s@@ ings connected with the vi@@ adu@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected with Fi@@ ji .
it is the first of four pres@@ ences of the &quot; Deck@@ geb@@ auer se &quot; that leads to each of the three towers of the bridge .
it is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 sh@@ ob@@ atics .
the £ 1,35 billion expensive project is to be completed by May 2017 .
prof@@ iling K@@ ei@@ th Brown takes place a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first that went from the country to the bridge .
he said , &quot; this is an historical and symbo@@ lic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cros@@ s@@ ings .
we are all witnesses of an engine@@ er at this project with over 30,@@ 000 tons of concrete and steel that have been used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the slaugh@@ ter between the vi@@ adu@@ ct and to the end deck a hei@@ le activity which require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit .
overall , almost 79 % of the total tri@@ cks at their place and the last section of the de@@ cks is getting a Bet@@ ong@@ ation for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge at its place .
Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Contr@@ ast said : &quot; the first closure is a substantial milestone in every fund .
with this fantastic project the closure is forward @-@ forward @-@ forward and low @-@ construction .
after the installation of the last road cover and its connection with the expanding Nord@@ tur@@ m@@ deck , we had to close the still existing gap on the north or land side .
this was achieved by opening the northern refu@@ ge bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very hot activity .
massive , as the vi@@ adu@@ ct 222 meters long , about 6,@@ 000 tons weighs and when a gra@@ dient of approximately 3 % had to be moved up .
tou@@ ches , as the toler@@ ances , on which the team works , tiny , were tiny - on each side they prayed only a few milli@@ meters .
fortunately everything went very well .

the police could take the perpet@@ rat@@ ors .
during the 50 @-@ year @-@ ol@@ ds the clothes of his ex friend destroyed , he called his mother .
these al@@ arm@@ oured conversion of his sister .
together with their lives , the 45 @-@ year wanted to calm their brother .
but she could not move it to leave the apartment .
therefore she went out with their lives from the house .
on the road they met the ex @-@ life @-@ risk of man .

who is building ste@@ ering cheap apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Green Power : investors will continue to be much stronger in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you respond to the bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick over the coming years almost 1300 priced apartments are losing ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is propos@@ ing to the next install@@ ment for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pur@@ ity concept &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but dispute is program@@ med .
first and foremost , it is about the question : who is to build affordable housing actually ?
a regulation is missing so far .
SPD @-@ leader Christoph Burg@@ mann means : &quot; we are able to build with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas in future , 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot;
the beneficial apartments can also be produced in stock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the big dispute settlement in the city hall is however , such as Brat@@ man : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to build up with investors who want to build on private areas ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build investors to such areas at least 10 percent , but as possible as 20 per cent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new municipal housing program , which will cost millions of cost and is still financed to incenti@@ vi@@ zed for incentives .
the problem , such as Brat@@ man : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the political groups . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as short as possible .
the left is still hard@@ drive for investors .
regardless of his , so Brat@@ man , ba@@ hne is a shar@@ pen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market .
the manual concept is implemented , that will ensure additional tasks in the construction management .
more staff is required .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the specialists .
but the program is not entirely entirely : for the around 1260 new apartments , which should be built in .
but how do you move the loss of further around 1300 affordable housing , whose support will be running in the coming years ?
only up to 2020 there will be 500 apartments .
to prevent this , so the plan@@ ne@@ tic Spre@@ cher@@ in Nicole Palm , should now be rede@@ emed from the city now .
moreover , it would have to be veri@@ fied , apartments again back to the price .
this is possible in the West City .
one fell sw@@ oop to solve the problem .
for in the West city run until the end of the year .
some 1800 apartments you could get back to price for cheap apartments .
only : we do not want the owners , the residential buildings not .
for the number of social housing in the West city increases dramatically , one is removed from the target of so @-@ called di@@ interference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a concentration of social dis@@ weak in just a few parts should not share it anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will be the discussion in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; pres@@ idents Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a vast majority , the CD@@ U must move into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the focus is focused on more architectural sites for family homes .
but what does not say that not yet a compromise can be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt to health and happiness that &apos;s worth it
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
that teenage children and child for playing no longer go outside , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time , on scre@@ ens , has been too rig@@ id in the last decade of many .
at Pok@@ emon Go , it is about getting people from the sofa and to let us be active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and last limited to smart@@ phones .
therefore , it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mut@@ ually exclusive .
I then refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters which were initially created for the video games in the 1990s ( later origin@@ ated , a cartoon , game cards and other spin @-@ Off@@ s ) .
as many phenomena of Pop@@ ulation , the interest in the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand start of July something .
the market introduction in other countries was moved by the massive demand that over@@ load the server .
inside a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go more users as Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players go out with their smart@@ phones for out and looking for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons , which will be trac@@ ed with a GPS once they have found once again , &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( via a scre@@ enshot on the phone ) or to be captured . &quot;
one generation who played the game when she was younger , joined the W@@ ahn , and j@@ ump@@ ed for the search of the sofa .
in the U.S. the game led to a considerable rise in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person rep@@ aired every day .
Car@@ di@@ ogra@@ m , an app for Apple Watch , the 35.@@ 000 users have recently prosec@@ uted that within two days of launch of the game , the number of persec@@ uted people who are practic@@ ed every day 30 minutes by 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who of it Pok@@ é@@ mon Go plays - it just looks the raw data to the performance .
many public wording of campaigns to health , people want to take &quot; to take &quot; 30 minutes &apos; time , &quot; from the sofa , &quot; and &quot; every day to be active &quot; sti@@ cker , because many public messages to health are boring and come by people who look .
however , the significance of sport can not be reviewed .
who regularly drives , reduces its opportunities to erk@@ ist cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here .
but the wonderful thing to Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that people bringing people to do something in the open , that they are fun .
thus , three pillars of health covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine and fun .
some people close the hunt even new friends .
as always there are too ri@@ ric play@@ der@@ ers that have always to compl@@ ain about something .
and yes , someone might walk against a door .
what should &apos;s ?
it has a break@@ through .
even if smartphone apps as Fit@@ bit already used to follow our activity before , they gave us no reason to practice sports , as this game is doing .
the New will lose its charm and the use will be for@@ ged with the time .
however , because of poker success , however , there will be more games to uni@@ te apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ites in the real world and to help many people on the hunt , active , f@@ itter and health@@ ier .

Simone Bil@@ it is on all this imm@@ un .
dynam@@ ically on the jumping @-@ horse .
ef@@ fort@@ less on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
on whole line brilli@@ ant .
now finally at the Olympi@@ ad .
the 19 @-@ year American Tur@@ ner in kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday to the multi @-@ campus title and enlarged the gap between itself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the head@@ light @-@ light of the Olympic Games .
her overall portrait of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly before the Silver med@@ al med@@ all@@ ists and &quot; Final Five &quot; -@@ Mann@@ ab@@ sc@@ op@@ ad@@ in A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ a@@ ists ali@@ ya Mu@@ st@@ af@@ ina .
the American Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt at the Sch@@ web@@ eb@@ al@@ ken during the single @-@ phase of women at the Kunst@@ verein in Rio de Jan@@ eiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual American , who wins a multi @-@ campaign titles and overall the fifth , while taking its reputation the best of their generation or even at all .
she broke out in t@@ ears when their end was shown and her long journey in this moment was an end .
this success puts them in the same League such as unique athletes , such as Michael P@@ helps who have brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es domin@@ ates the last three years their sport art , 15 World Championships - including 10 gold med@@ g@@ og@@ gles - with such aston@@ ishing exercises , that the Olympi@@ asi@@ ve of 1984 Mary Lou bail@@ on from her said that she has ever seen the best Tur@@ ner@@ in that I ever have seen . &quot;
they expected them a final test in Brazil , a competition which wasn &apos;t so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of dimension@@ ed expectations .
not with a hand@@ ful gold back to the family in Spring , Texas return , would be seen as disappointment .
the American Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace , after each of the gold and Silver in the single @-@ multi @-@ campus of women in the art summer 2016 , in Rio de Jan@@ eiro , Brazil , Thursday , won
Bil@@ es hol@@ te the first coin on Tuesday , while she served on the far@@ ewell party of retirement in Ruh@@ le Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a ru@@ ru@@ ding marks .
although Bil@@ es existed , during their long hike on the top , never the future planned , this is not really true .
a part of their Flo@@ ows - the its typical Tum@@ bling Pass is included in Latin American music which would be at home on the road outside the Olymp@@ ia@@ arena in Rio .
this is not an accident .
this girl who adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child , and by train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother was discovered during a school@@ ing in the gym@@ nasium , was trained to power .
she has not lost a multi @-@ campus competition for summer 2013 , which will last as long as it wishes .
even if Mu@@ st@@ af@@ ina led by two la@@ th@@ rows , the picture shows .
Sch@@ web@@ eb@@ al@@ ken and Bo@@ dent@@ ally - in which Bil@@ es holds the World Championships - lou@@ der .
she brought up again with 15,@@ 433 on the flo@@ od flow off - and sat down with a 15,@@ 933 on the ground nor one on it .
Ra@@ is@@ man um@@ arm@@ oured them g@@ ently than they were expecting her end - a pure form@@ ality - and t@@ ears flow on Bil@@ es sh@@ iny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision that she was once used in her cl@@ amping book for reality .
the achievement of Ra@@ is@@ mans was an reven@@ ge for the last time four years ago , when she went to the third place but the Bronze med@@ al in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke on Mu@@ st@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time the 22 @-@ year teams already had called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

police : 3 victims in serial waste from music in the car .
according to the police reporting which were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girls were shot , who have entered into one of the de@@ adly attacks from Phoenix , while they stopped in the car during a decade and heard music .
Angela Rochelle Lin@@ er , Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter of Lot were shot on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked in an entrance to the authorities .
the perpet@@ rat@@ ors eight shots from a hand @-@ car@@ afe , while he stood on the passenger side of the car and then fl@@ ew with another vehicle , is in the report .
the police shared with that the thre@@ e@@ fold murder does not have been the result of a smo@@ k@@ over@@ f@@ all seems , since the att@@ acker may not be the hand@@ po@@ ckets or the $ 2,@@ 900 took the possession of an adult victims .
the police spok@@ es@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the Medi@@ ter@@ ies inv@@ ade the investig@@ ator to a direct view to whether they are connected with four previous attacks .
in total , mainly in his@@ panic residential houses have killed seven people in nine attack and two others have been wo@@ und@@ ed .
&quot; it is happening in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; shared Howard of K@@ H@@ PO , an affiliate of CB@@ S , beginning of the month .
it is believed that the sus@@ pic@@ ious number has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
the Medi@@ ator ref@@ used to have the evidence of the conclusion that they are linked to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and by the same mur@@ derer .
Ellis , 33 , was realised due to their inj@@ uries and died later .
liner , 31 , and Ellis daughter of Mal@@ ea still died on site .
a witness of the police with that it was not un@@ common for them to sit in a par@@ om@@ able car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which was pushed for an empty pick @-@ up truck was half an hour before the thre@@ e@@ fold murder and from that it worked out that it was the work of the serial ports .
Medi@@ ator found Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and safe ball from the seat as well as p@@ ow@@ ments from the motor area .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ ol@@ ds with micro@@ phones : &quot; it becomes better &quot;
as most of the six @-@ year loves Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ uto the S@@ ingen , to@@ ys and of course his mother .
but as the least of his al@@ ter@@ ies , Ed@@ mund micro@@ z@@ ephal@@ y , the result of a gene@@ tic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ uto has nothing to knew during their pregnancy .
when he came home for the first time , my first thought , I managed not .
I do not know that .
I didn &apos;t let me know .
what is not true -- of course , one has left itself on it , &quot; said she .
your husband Vincent and you have told that Ed@@ mund had never seen them under circumstances and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they sm@@ ote him to promote him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first response to this was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people still make , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ uto . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of a notification .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor cur@@ se up to his third year , and he can still not speak .
but it slowly makes progress .
he can run with support and cycling .
he also loves to play with his two brothers and sing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the drawing address , which is Ed@@ mund for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please sing me something &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bring to him &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ uto CB@@ S News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is not a typical character language -- says it . Ed@@ mund has inv@@ ented some characters alone .
micro@@ z@@ ephal@@ y has a variety of causes : gene@@ tic as with Ed@@ mund and infections with viruses such as mas@@ ks or the Zi@@ ka@@ virus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how to influence the life of this with the Zi@@ ka@@ virus .
Pic@@ ci@@ uto is remin@@ ds of the emotional price of a certain future .
I asked constantly , what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they still know it really .
I &apos;ve been asking for a long time for a long time , because I didn &apos;t expect me to tell me anyone .
but Pic@@ ci@@ uto has a hop@@ eful rating for mothers of inf@@ ants who were caused by the Zi@@ ka@@ virus .
it is better .
you know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .

the grand@@ parents gave us that Brown has been p@@ per@@ im@@ s several cas@@ ing inj@@ uries , including in the L@@ ende , arm and belly , but that he was with his transport to hospital in consciousness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has made a lot , his small body was passed by balls , &quot; shared his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the sender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot believe that .
the state of the boys became in a hospital as a critical and he had to under@@ go several operations .
the family of the boys shared with the sender that he is expected to be back .
he should have been the first class in a local school school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were shot , three men : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year men is in critical state ; the other two victims are according to CB@@ S Philadelphia in stable state .
the boy was placed on the front of a car along with the 29 @-@ year @-@ year , which is shot in a critical state , reported the transmitter .
the other two victims were not found in the car and the police are exactly whether under one of the last men of the perpet@@ rat@@ ors could be found .
the Medi@@ ator shared CB@@ S Philadelphia with that it seems to become a crus@@ hing between several guns .
pat@@ ron s@@ ül@@ sen for over@@ lap , which have been trac@@ ed to various assault ri@@ dic@@ ally , ski@@ pped the Tat@@ ort .
it seems clear that this is clearly to a continual battle being negoti@@ ated .
on the street , on both sides of the walking , they found H@@ ül@@ sen .
so it seems to have been here several armed fighters that were very active involved , &quot; shared pol@@ ishing Anthony of the Con@@ feder@@ ation of the police in Philadelphia to the sender .
there are several houses and vehicles have been made in the area .
there came to no strong@@ hold and the police currently examine these reports , i.e. the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 year @-@ year girls hit by a cross @-@ sleeps , when she played in front of her house in the residential area of the West Oak Lan@@ e .
she reco@@ vers and the police are still looking for a sus@@ pic@@ ious .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that &apos;s what I stand under the women &apos;s Olympics in the turn , and that is more than one reason .
first , I have been in the winter since 1984 at every summer Olympics , and the USA were never so dominant .
and secondly , this team has three tur@@ ally , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Dou@@ glas and Lau@@ ren , &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; H@@ ern@@ an@@ dez , who inspir@@ ing for many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the J@@ ü@@ din is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the Ka@@ tho@@ lic is , ab@@ round , makes every proud .
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has the black and his@@ panic feminine presence at the top of this sport art .
in the last four years the number one was one under the female tower inside an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this is strength .
at the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Dou@@ glas was a striking at the Olympi@@ ast@@ ew@@ inner and the Americas .
now the world was able to witness the un@@ believ@@ able performance of the triple world master@@ in Simone Bil@@ es , Dou@@ glas and Lau@@ rie H@@ ern@@ an@@ dez , as they had in@@ wa@@ ited , but may@@ or Gym@@ as@@ tically sub@@ routines .
on Thursday was Simone the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual American , who won in an individual multi @-@ campaign event for women gold .
teams member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won Silver .
we are experiencing the tip of this sport , but so many classes in the whole country does not see .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie sm@@ ote all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison a to create it into the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; L@@ earn Five , &quot; because the next Olympics will have only four d@@ ner@@ ves in the team . besides , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as trainers .
but the reality looks so that Tur@@ ns is a more expensive sport and turbine is primarily associated with their parents , which will cost of parents , travel - Be@@ verages - , competition and hotel costs ( for the coach and their tower and families ) . the list can be opened .
the majority of these turn@@ around are in prosp@@ erous suburbs which can support the business .
in these clubs , the tur@@ ers will receive its overall training and that is for families a te@@ ures and long @-@ term commitment .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainers of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainers of Lau@@ rie H@@ ern@@ an@@ dez , have both their athletes , since they started with the turn .
we have to be inspired by the municipalities of countless , young girls , which are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a high @-@ performance and easy accessible .
I was founded my turn@@ around of 20 years ago .
at my events we have free and affordable turn in Harlem for more than 15,@@ 000 urban young people ( especially black and his@@ panic ) performed both national and international winner .
in September we will expand to Det@@ ro@@ it ( my hom@@ etown ) expands to the youth of high @-@ quality turbines that make the opportunity to learn from this great ol@@ ymp@@ ic sport art .
Tur@@ ns develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determin@@ at@@ eness for the mind .
this combination offers lifetime benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that bring thousands of young girls to care for the turn and that is great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thank Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en des ol@@ ymp@@ ic Mann@@ ing gol@@ ds and thank you , F@@ ass her as many young girls with different background to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women .
Assist@@ ants would like to organise more stri@@ kes after they have rejected Jer@@ em@@ y H@@ unts proposal
the ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the changes made by adop@@ ting a Protest@@ ant contract with the functioning of the British Medical Association , but 58 per cent of the 37.@@ 000 assist@@ ants that agree on a choice for them .
in July Hunt plans un@@ v@@ eil@@ ed the contract to perform the contract , and said that the N@@ HS would be harmful in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and any further delay in the employees and patients were harmful .
the first assist@@ ants should get a new contract , the changes to bed@@ - and weekend work contains to improve care of the clock @-@ times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A Com@@ mitt@@ ees for assistant Particip@@ ants have reached the proposed contract to the proposed contract to the proposed contract , especially that it is to treat the current social crisis and ad@@ mitted to treat all doctors &apos; . &quot;
for only eight weeks , which still remain unaffected by the first group of doctors under the new contract , must be made progress and running time .
efforts on the part of the BM@@ A for resol@@ ving disputes arising due to discussions on the Government and sometimes on o@@ be@@ ating silence .
this happened during an accident , the Jer@@ em@@ y Hunt was made last month over the last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; Jer@@ em@@ y Hunt has to act now to raise the imp@@ etus and the worries of the assist@@ ants . &quot;
should he do not do this , so we have made the assistant &apos;s assistant that they are ready to perform further labour measures .
the last strike of the end of April saw a boost of nearly 13.@@ 000 Rout@@ ine@@ oper@@ ations and 100.000 Termin@@ als , since nur@@ ses and specialist doctors were included to grant doctors on the strike @-@ mail .
the ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the adoption of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants a better week@@ days for the 54.@@ 000 assist@@ ants that are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Direct@@ orate @-@ actor of the N@@ HS employees , called the assistant of assistance to end the strike .
Mor@@ timer said : &quot; labour measures don &apos;t reach the only little , but already loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patients , nur@@ ses and their families only concerns , trouble and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
in the last two months we talked to the Com@@ at of assist@@ ants and the Health Minister as well as other mini@@ stri@@ es to respond positively to the concerns regarding the pres@@ et and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings .
the employers hop@@ ed that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as po@@ sting , flexibility in medicine - a sign for those who were by a vocational training , training courses and the basic @-@ specific pay@@ coun@@ ties in medicine - a sign for such as seriously it is the employer , the Health Education England and the Health @-@ Ministry of compliance with BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ pro day - medication that can reduce the heart attack
thousands of cardi@@ ovas@@ cular patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day , after the authorities recommended that more people are recommended for a longer period of time .
the ger@@ eh@@ em@@ men@@ o drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk re@@ peti@@ tive cardi@@ ovas@@ cular for people with a her@@ edit@@ ary disease .
the drug is already given 12 months after a heart attack , making the risk of a stroke if or another heart attack .
the regulatory authority NI@@ CE of the N@@ HS has recommended a four years for long intake to reduce the risk of cardi@@ ovas@@ cular problems .
the regulatory authority NI@@ CE of the N@@ HS has recommended a four years for long intake to reduce the risk of cardi@@ ovas@@ cular problems .
some 14@@ 0,000 people suffer each year a heart attack and a quarter of that suffer from another heart attack or stroke .
cardi@@ ovas@@ cular and perc@@ ussions are caused by accumulation of fet@@ al material in the ar@@ ter@@ ial cells .
if the re@@ mark diver@@ ts , it may cause a bl@@ otting , that caused the blood flow to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack .
if the blo@@ od@@ stream occurs , it can flow through the blood flow and the blood flow to the brain , which causes a stroke .
individuals who had already had a heart attack , are subject to a higher risk to have another risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or that is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ w eca , and under the commercial name Bri@@ li@@ que is reduced , reduces this risk by making the formation of blo@@ od@@ ds un@@ even more likely .
the executive design of NI@@ CE , which today published today is recommended a 12 @-@ monthly intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , directors reported : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons who have suffered a heart attack or a stroke - often with dis@@ su@@ ous consequences . &quot;
the fear of renewed cardi@@ ac disease can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in effectively near the reduction of other cardi@@ ovas@@ cular and perc@@ ussions in people who had already had a heart attack .
through a preliminary recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are pleased that we are able to extend the options of thousands of people who benefit from it .
the information on the effectiveness and security of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the blood @-@ risk - is limited to a period of up to three years . the executive design is not advised of treatment resulting over this period .
culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness makes sc@@ ales in Muslim areas
the former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ for Rah@@ man was removed last year at Ver@@ c@@ ission of a government report due to corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to that far @-@ spread elect@@ oral election in Muslim communities ign@@ ores as an ver@@ itable government report today .
the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es acc@@ esses the police , elect@@ orate and Rath@@ isms to have ignored the evidence of elect@@ oral abuse due to &quot; over@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ics and religion . &quot;
the former minister of integration and commun@@ c@@ government , which now is a Ant@@ cor@@ rupt @-@ w@@ ren , said that the intim@@ id@@ ation of el@@ ers from religious moti@@ fs that it should be the police that it should be the police just outside of choices to protect voters .
he recommends that voters should lead a reference to us in order to prove their identity .
at the time a voters will only need to name his name and address .
the report pro@@ poses to in@@ dem@@ ni@@ ble ink on the finger of a person when they turn their choices to avoid that anyone will el@@ ect twice .
whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lowers should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
he calls for the press to have more access to the coun@@ ters and decisions of not official Com@@ mitt@@ ees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this serves not only against election campaign , but also the municipal government in front of the wider cor@@ rup@@ ture and financial contributions , which brings with it , &quot; said , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by the Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower of Ham@@ lets choice and@@ als in the East of Lon@@ d@@ ons .
last year , a special op@@ ori@@ ent@@ ree that the acting Mayor Lut@@ on for an Lit@@ an@@ ei on cor@@ rupt and illegal practices of his ministry should be revealed .
the judgment was that Rah@@ man could have had the religious feelings of his mus@@ lim@@ an Community &quot; in cy@@ tic manner &quot; and that he would have brought his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bic cul@@ no@@ ons to silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man is said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign was based on the basis that it may be the relative obligation of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 voices were either ext@@ ingu@@ ished or the consequence of a im@@ itation , when a person will el@@ ect a person than someone of others .
Sir Eric said that it would be there in all the land proof of che@@ ating .
it is expressed in particular al@@ arm@@ ing for fr@@ au@@ dul@@ ent letters - in the older members of the Muslim people would have made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , ab@@ formed , made several recommendations to extract the elect@@ oral system , including the leadership to prove the identity
in his report it is said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as proof was attached that pressure on vulnerable members were exerc@@ ised , especially women and young people to choose according to the Will@@ ens of older , especially communities with Pak@@ istan@@ ic or ban@@ qu@@ ered back@@ ward background . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions such a behaviour because of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over@@ sensitivity regarding the eth@@ ics and religion would have ignored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric spoke of 50 recommendations for ob@@ serving the system , including the pro@@ hibition that political activ@@ ists deal with , to stop &quot; elect@@ oral elect@@ oral . &quot;
the report , which is pul@@ led by Ther@@ esa May , also requires harder registration investigations in order to prevent that the elect@@ oral directory is used to im@@ mig@@ rat@@ ors and social prot@@ ru@@ gs .
options to be considered , voters before the election after your reference .

request that only English is used in the selection stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the employees usually push that voters go alone into the elect@@ orate .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropol@@ itan Police and finds it &quot; amazing , &quot; after the Tower of Ham@@ lets fall no criminal indic@@ ator .
&quot; the elect@@ oral court has declared Rum@@ ania and his dep@@ uty for due to a Lit@@ an@@ ei on cor@@ rupt and illegal practices , &quot; he said .
he became known because of a number of reasons for sub@@ mitt@@ ing - according to the high demands in the stra@@ ined method - guil@@ ty .
he also cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed the effective &quot; ab@@ h@@ ak@@ controlled &quot; of the elect@@ oral departments of the Rath@@ mb@@ als .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the Court part in Tower Ham@@ lets of last year was a warning signal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country contributes to the mother of parli@@ aments , but the wor@@ rying and conc@@ e@@ ons of elect@@ oral sc@@ ams and den@@ ial of some authorities are threat@@ ening this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the team member of the US team in Archery Br@@ ady Ell@@ ison has caused an attack on Twitter after pictures , on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street Star in@@ secret@@ ly similar .
in fact , Archery given the mad@@ ness in the social media with and gave that he has been hearing since his childhood , that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself see no big simil@@ arity with the exception of the fac@@ ial hair , &quot; shared Br@@ ady the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a tri@@ cky guy , so let me feel the probably as ac@@ compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 this year will definitely appear more to the centre : the asc@@ ending simil@@ arity between the British Weit@@ br@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Harris .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter @-@ U@@ ser@@ in stated their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that H@@ ope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the sale area , they took a pair of under@@ p@@ ants from the cli@@ p@@ board , its own Str@@ ights and tro@@ users from and tried them .

how to protect yourself with tie Mag@@ a in front of arms
the world outside is a dangerous place but this video from D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you .
we talked to Rh@@ on Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand@@ master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Ver@@ ban@@ des in New York to find out how to move with armed inc@@ ense .
regardless of whether you can approach from the front or from the rear , this video will show you how to turn for your inc@@ ense .
if one go back to you from the rear , then you should look at as one , so that you can see your att@@ acker , and &quot; from the bus line , &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
gra@@ b the weapon then between your front and your shoul@@ der before you hit him with your free el@@ bow .
let him so@@ w him up with the knee in the body , and turn off while the att@@ acker will merge with him , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move down , while they turn the weapon to him .
in Ang@@ els , which approach from the front , the technique is similar - moving your body from the flow line , take the weapon and turn it , so that the att@@ acker cannot shoot .
change the weight of the weapon and beat your att@@ acker on the chest , then turn the weapon from his handle , before they move back@@ wards and set the weapon to it .

Rei@@ er Ian W@@ right push for a guide his tongue to the most beautiful places of Europe
an animal @-@ body pul@@ led his immune system and wor@@ r@@ ef@@ le@@ x a serious examination - by giving a few of the most tast@@ ed and su@@ perf@@ ected places of Europe .
the moder@@ ator and Travel W@@ right Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k sch@@ utter its wake @-@ up at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a dishwasher at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a dishwasher of a train toil@@ ette as well as a public phone in Russia to prove the resistance of its immune system .
in front of each object , he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show up and show us what he will let yourself be .
but the experim@@ ent that under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was fil@@ med , brought some surprising outcomes to day@@ light .
the thought , the dishwasher of a conc@@ entri@@ c cover , which was already used by thousands it may be completely ab@@ as@@ hed , but actually there are in a kitchen tun@@ er more bad bacteria .
on his journey through Europe Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical professionals across the promotion of refriger@@ ation as well as about his own health .
fortunately , left nothing , what he de@@ ed , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known for it to test the resistance capacity of his intest@@ ines by making the world ri@@ pe and peculi@@ ar , as well as wonderful things .
from public funds to railway lines up to dishwasher of toilets , the task set its immune system definitely under a sample
in the film he told us : &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and s@@ amm@@ ation . &quot;
in the film he was able to do justice to his reputation .
the interior which he de@@ af was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its der@@ egi@@ ance showed a L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ri@@ fication of over 4000 units .
in comparison to the L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ri@@ fication , the L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ric hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet that he ref@@ used to ref@@ used , after their L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ri@@ fication over 4000 units was , while fresh rep@@ ented hands played by less than 60
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of da@@ iry products vali@@ o manufactured the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; who shows the bacter@@ i@@ ties in different places like the bathroom
in the film he says : &quot; that comes the worst I have in a toilet , near . &quot;
there is nothing dirt than that !
I will say nothing here because it is dr@@ agon@@ istic here .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of da@@ iry products .
the company covers Mr. W@@ right with validation of validation as well as vitamin C and D as well as vitamin C and D as well as vitamin C and immune system .
validation Senior Venice President for snacks , s@@ aps and New categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer the consumers really something new .
something that is fascinating to look and at the same time explains the benefits of probi@@ otics .
we brought &quot; mad Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings by doing so that we said &quot; L@@ ass to call us Ian . &quot;
you claim that the interest in the health or health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of the intest@@ inal health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in the intest@@ inal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary , we could provide the consumer more information in an interesting way .
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
Tom H@@ ak@@ ala created by the director of the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I could have imag@@ ined my respect for Ian if he pointed some of things that I have noted him , such as the ectic Russian toilet , which will be shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things when it was easier to bring Ian to get rid of them , and others upon which this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad that we have recorded some of this tast@@ eful cer@@ es on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in one of Vali@@ o survey conducted by 2015 associ@@ ative 84 percent of all surv@@ eys , particularly with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ine and 58 per cent they said at least occasionally products , the attached mil@@ k@@ ill@@ us bacteria .

T@@ anya Sk@@ el@@ don and her partner Sh@@ aun Tre@@ bil@@ cock were sent after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they have been violent from their property , sho@@ cked sho@@ cked the property of the dormit@@ ories found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls prepared cl@@ aff@@ es holes on , wood ri@@ mp were destroyed , tr@@ ash was scattered on the floor scattered and gra@@ ff@@ iti was awarded to the walls .

Donn@@ a Mc@@ E@@ voy that works for home management at Corn@@ wall Housing , said that they are fear@@ ed that the apartment is no longer to fix .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was here for people here an absolute night@@ mare and I am the view that people must not live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider because this property is probably considered to be considered to be so beautiful part of the walls .
the family is touch and its reputation is it too .
the pair had three sons , the inter@@ pret@@ ations of the apartment lived and the police said that the terror who have inserted the family , intim@@ id@@ ation of living , drug abuse , drug and over@@ coming scre@@ ams , hor@@ seb@@ ack and flu@@ ids .
Sk@@ el@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the le@@ ase Agreement , received in June a arrangement for anti@@ social behavior .
in some rooms of the house that will be tor@@ n under certain circumstances , old tr@@ ash was found
there were tr@@ aded in the property in which in the past drugs have been acted to wood@@ cuts
neighbours were saying that they had to fight them on the road and regularly called the police to be inv@@ oked .
Corn@@ wall Housing sie and her partner this week violent from the estate , after they gave them a prolong@@ ed period of 11 weeks to ex@@ clude out volunt@@ arily .
the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ fication were che@@ ered by lighten@@ ed neighb@@ ors who said that their lives was made of hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they turned to anyone &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today tomorrow we could not sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood here , because it was so quiet - we are not used !
now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice .
Adam F@@ itz@@ b@@ igh@@ ck , Ne@@ igh@@ bour@@ hood Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that it would have passed the family to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house , which was called the police in regular intervals , 20 years long
on the over@@ grown page of the community house , tr@@ ash and old to@@ ys were sent down
he added : &quot; it is a shame that it considers the ten@@ ant to take any responsibility for their behavior and the ones of their family since a delay is always the last step , the Corn@@ wall Housing into consideration .
that was a very difficult case , since the behaviour was extremely difficult and their deeds have to look at a hor@@ ri@@ ble .
I appreciate all the work , which my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community , which are mu@@ ster on us and have given us the information we have made .
I hope that this development of some neighbours will sp@@ ends , and the message is convey@@ ed that anti@@ social behavior is not toler@@ ated .

after they had without Ob@@ d@@ ach , it worked out that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many rooms of the house were consumed with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that they will not arrange ten@@ ants , which do not keep up to the landl@@ ord .
Angela C@@ row is part of the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , that the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ veness may have a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants that do not believe in the domestic order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who beh@@ ave to yourself without self @-@ ordin@@ ances , as well as those who were trou@@ bled by such behaviour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate the criminal and anti@@ social behaviour that continue to cooperate with partners to safeguard our communities .

Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where there is angr@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
blessed Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals get nothing from the summer of campaign with - and the holiday makers from North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia must not choose the country .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they have understood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2021 will not be held once again at the end of summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament has already decided in the beginning of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for bl@@ ur@@ inate than so far it is not : summer holidays , heat and land@@ mark jack@@ et - this is concerned .
the n@@ atives are to be convinced by the choices are going on holiday .
most of the tourists who are in the country , on Us@@ edom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so may not choose the country .
these are practical issues : in the holidays are of hel@@ pers , the po@@ sters fl@@ as@@ so@@ ons , fl@@ yers , and distribute the end voices , only m@@ üh@@ ev@@ oll .
until the 4th of September 2016 , the election of the elect@@ oral and the last press , the Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to be gone by just under the people and let go along with just around the people .
the hot phase , if one can say that at all , has just begun .
and it also goes to something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Cel@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U Co@@ alition , must be of his office for fear .
the SPD , since 1998 the strongest party , now lies in surv@@ eys , clearly behind the CD@@ U .
thr@@ illing will be thr@@ illing as strong new@@ com@@ ers Af@@ D , and what remains at the end of Ko@@ ali@@ tion@@ st@@ aug@@ ust .
cel@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 Res@@ sch@@ ef , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tr@@ usive elect@@ oral campaign , one can see from his big bags .
he travelled through the land , distributed ro@@ ses and pl@@ au@@ es a little bit with the people , as it also has been his legend@@ ary wor@@ t@@ cardi@@ ac predec@@ essor Harald Ring@@ storff .
otherwise it has received met@@ ering feet and gives ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or Merkel the fault of the bl@@ ossom of the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your refuge@@ e policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have acceler@@ ated the rise to the right @-@ wing popul@@ ists , which makes him probably going to cost the beautiful position now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its top @-@ level data , the Federal Minister Lorenz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced as it is , if you do at the wrong time in the right place .
it has invited twice a ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or Angela Merkel ; Merkel Bund@@ est@@ ag@@ gra@@ ahl@@ em is located in the north @-@ east .
but the target group was not , there were more North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia , Berlin and Saxony da as M@@ eckl@@ esi@@ de and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority of other Länder &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compl@@ ained Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also had nobody to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel .
otherwise the North @-@ CD@@ U is largely adjusted to the usual number of choices on market parking spaces and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbr@@ ellas and hot paras@@ ol .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this , so liked Kok@@ ert , plays only one &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ordered role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also the Union has noticed that you put on the ground the base , that it has to be very rig@@ orous again , again , again a wire to the people .
you are doing it like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the hor@@ seb@@ ack of the country hardly exists .
the Council of the CD@@ U choices led co@@ inci@@ de co@@ inci@@ de . &quot; you must go to that , where people are w@@ ast@@ est , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Gol@@ dene weddings , every birth@@ days party must be used . &quot;
because much stands on the game , cel@@ eri@@ ering has now called his SPD to a particularly ambitious campaign .
in surv@@ eys the Socialists and Democrats recently concluded with 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and only just before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
in 2011 the SPD had become clear with 35,@@ 6 percent prior to CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , petty @-@ part@@ ei with seven percent in the surv@@ eys , do not want to create the leap into the country .
you make out of the holiday @-@ need a modern hat@@ red and embarrass@@ ed their elect@@ oral we@@ dge on the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Online @-@ election &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; is called the Landes@@ vor@@ sitz@@ ende Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise green choices are on track gauge by local stimulation among the vac@@ ation@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the Spitz@@ enk@@ andi@@ dat@@ in , cur@@ v@@ t just with a hous@@ ebo@@ at by the m@@ eckl@@ en@@ burg@@ ische lakes and finds it still beautiful .
your impression : &quot; elect@@ oral holiday in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ restoration : restaurants suffer from blo@@ cking
in the quick@@ ness , with which the B 27 is done , there is nothing to compl@@ ain .
for those responsible for construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30 o &apos;clock in the morning and only against 8 pm , there is all@@ ergy praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these have made everything pretty z@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; tells El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the Jet gas station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super team .
there is also no de@@ duc@@ tions .
the construction site could be moved to the semi @-@ beginning at the semi @-@ time plan@@ ed to the south end of October until the end of October should be everything ready .
obes@@ e will also be the expl@@ oration of those responsible for construction work , around when it comes to the establishment of Beh@@ el@@ sions .
since the construction site on Monday to the south , and also the blo@@ cking of asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen has been removed and thus also the connection to R@@ ott@@ enburg has again established itself the traffic situation within the place relaxed .
citizens can now proceed from O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen from the B 27 again .
the do@@ dge @-@ traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were partly considerable complaints , &quot; says the executive management of the re@@ organization responsible pres@@ idents of Florian King .
the inhabitants of Bach@@ el@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many sno@@ ok@@ es su@@ dden and more of their Nav@@ i trust than the signs .
what led to man@@ cher trucks in housing areas .
since also the speed limit are not met , the community has intensi@@ fies the mess@@ es from M@@ ös@@ sing .
&quot; there was considerable transi@@ tions , &quot; says King , who made himself on site about the situation .
there are two to three per minute already two to three per minute .
the quick@@ est was on the speed @-@ 30 @-@ zone at the speed @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
for the construction site , it has become more quiet but more quiet .
for the busin@@ ess@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from R@@ ott@@ enburg now the road is open again .
the cards will have a look at the hands of busin@@ ess@@ men .
but that the B 27 @-@ renov@@ ations has led to them in sales and leaves each one that you ask .
however , some more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who has nothing to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; , so for other companies , for which the restructuring is hardly any consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Ma@@ ier , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; no slight decline , but sp@@ ati@@ t but also a that of course is missing . &quot;
the prestigious along the road are the strongest part of the road .
J. Albert G@@ öhn@@ er , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , former crown , takes distinct words .
this is already exist@@ ent .
not only him , but all the restaurants made it hard . &quot;
it lack@@ ed the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and R@@ ott@@ because .
we have to be glad to be glad about each Euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sales included in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far above 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road positioning have thrown its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
half of his staff have to release .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and the half had been released , the policy would re@@ acted .
instead , President Jörg Schmidt on a request of G@@ öhn@@ er , if it respon@@ ds to a financial compensation , with the reference , otherwise of the advantages of the situation at the B 27 Now they have also the cons that arise from renov@@ ations .
G@@ öhn@@ er knows of other land@@ ing , where so somewhat more spacious .
with all coll@@ agen , G@@ öhn@@ er is sure that his restaurant will continue to pass .
finally , the family business has already been settled since 1715 , it refers to the long history .
that other regul@@ ars now are less frequently to look forward because of the complicated road traffic less frequently , it can be understood .
if you cannot drive , it is also elsewhere .
that his regular cli@@ ent@@ el after the end of the refurb@@ ishment is back again , he has no doubt .
despite the crises with B@@ SE and bird flu , G@@ öhn@@ er keeps the impact of the B 27 @-@ construction works to its customers for the greatest crisis that has experienced his restaurant in their long history .
six months construction work , this is already brut@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; constantly being on behalf of the terror@@ ist attack on laws . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks , the Minister de Ma@@ iz@@ ère presents a thick@@ er security package .
but what does a cont@@ end status to do with terror ?
and what does the Ko@@ ali@@ tion@@ ists say to all of the ?
Thomas de Ma@@ iz@@ ère gives the Com@@ promis@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ko@@ ali@@ tion@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Federal Minister for the performance of his new security packages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are not asking any@@ body .
others , further points would initially be discussed within the parties .
also in this case I call me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister of Minister shall be based on this results and on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; achieved consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Co@@ alition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Ma@@ al@@ ère has led to recent attacks in Würzburg and An@@ s@@ bach a little time before he presents his conclusions for security in the Republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the fall of this is quite as extensive .
a lot is already known , pro@@ claimed : that a new security authority is supposed to take care of the button @-@ encryp@@ ted communication , is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also not the fact that Germany has to put multiple EU guidelines to flight data and cease @-@ law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and staff for the safety authorities is also not surprising .
to Part starts de Ma@@ al@@ ère a second approach for proposals which have so far failed to make up with the SPD : he wants to make sympath@@ ie@@ ties for terr@@ aced groups under penalty and ji@@ ha@@ dis@@ ts with dou@@ bling ci@@ tiz@@ ens@@ hip in the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; sp@@ ati@@ al the CD@@ U @-@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still consider this to be reasonable and challenging as well as if the Ko@@ ali@@ tion@@ ist already did not have any chances .
a few new ideas will be presented by Ma@@ al@@ ère .
they have partly in itself : he plans fast @-@ method for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for addressing people from deport@@ ations .
refugees who are targeted to the country before their smart@@ phones should reveal their smart@@ phones and disclose social media accounts for a security testing .
when cu@@ ings for ex@@ pi@@ an asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some worse than so far - about such , the off@@ ences or to raise their Pap@@ ers to hide their identity .
some of them is politically and legal .
Man@@ ches has also still un@@ balanced and leaves questions open .
and at some points - in the im@@ treatment of thought of thought , for example - is the question : what does this actually do with safety and terror ?
yes , says de Ma@@ iz@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between refugees and terror .
but it cannot be in speech so that the attacks of An@@ s@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
in addition , many people have worried about the high refuge@@ e camps about safety .
and things that people are deeply stir@@ red , they left out also in election campaign .
the inner safety is enormous in the focus .
only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nizza .
then the attacks in Würzburg and An@@ s@@ bach .
the im@@ itable is great .
and yes , there are elect@@ oral struggles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Union and SPD contribute to the topic of inner safety as an increasingly position in the topic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; internal security &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past few days it was high up between the two parties .
only a gar@@ den@@ y argument about the equipment of the Federal Police , then via a safe @-@ policy ideas @-@ collection of some Uni@@ ons @-@ interior , in which the resort is also a Bur@@ ka ban and a land@@ ing from the double ci@@ tiz@@ ens@@ hip .
de Ma@@ al@@ ère are also here to reconc@@ il@@ able sounds .
from one conversion from the double pass he had nothing .
we have spoken the discussion in Germany .
you can re@@ fresh , be not sensible .
and with a Bur@@ ka ban , he has constitutional concerns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether his own package is constitutional and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not yet reasonable for the Ko@@ ali@@ tion@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a lot of things that could make a hass@@ le .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the SPD is currently trying to get profits on the subject of inner safety . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Party Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ aled with careful talk and says : &quot; the SPD is willing to talk about everything to talk about anything to increase security . &quot;
still comes Volkswagen gli@@ mp@@ se .
despite diesel motor as the pay@@ ers are pay@@ able worldwide .
but not in all markets it runs round .
in the call@@ tion there is a term for a term .
Volkswagen starts from the delivery within the second half of the year .
the largest high@@ lighting can be found in the previous year in the previous year despite the diesel aff@@ air thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ growing markets further .
however , in July weak@@ ening the core brand VW especially in Western Europe and res@@ ili@@ ete for sale again for the overall , as that in the D@@ ax noti@@ on company .
sold the brand VW in July with 4@@ 49@@ 100 cars 1,8 percent lower than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , after China the two @-@ key market , sales volumes are 14 percent below the previous year .
in the home market Germany the ship@@ ments around almost a hex@@ th .
mark@@ eted by Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weak@@ est figures from July especially on two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also have given it in some core markets through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; altered economic conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a purchase order &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
apart from the situation around the pl@@ aster test in Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ um will be charged to the Austr@@ ing from the EU , explain a speaker in .
in the U.S. , where the gas@@ aff@@ air first teles@@ cope , is also further a minus to Bu@@ che .
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
altogether , the mainly affected @-@ ro@@ ke of the Nieder@@ s@@ achsen tend to further gli@@ mp@@ se through the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months only represents a supplier of 0.9 per cent to twelve million vehicles at the end of the first seven months .
consolidated @-@ out sch@@ ef Fre@@ d Kap@@ pler was able to pass from January to July more
1,3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen in this period worldwide 5,@@ 904 million .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software Ab@@ gast@@ ests .
in Germany alone , VW about 2.5 million cars are calling for conversion into the workshops .
in the wake of the conversion , VW that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects .
after conversion of vehicles I give consumption in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor power no deteri@@ oration .
the motor@@ bikes prepare the client after conversion a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but do not speak of a &quot; guarantee , as it was on Friday in the company .
reason are legal qualities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been reported , Volkswagen granted his German customers now but a guarantee of permanent diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this had confirmed this last Monday VW @-@ representative in the Federal Minister of Commerce .
from the traffic crit@@ erion was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fulfil the resolutions of my investig@@ ative Commission and the KBA method . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; discre@@ pan@@ cies will not be accepted , &quot; said the Federal Minister Alexander Dobr@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , according to the ministry .
VW has assumed the warranty that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor power according to the conversion , no deteri@@ or@@ ations have been held unchanged and have all type of type @-@ permitted actions .
Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not as it was in corporate travel .
with the wide term &quot; guarantee &quot; Volkswagen the possibility that customers come for example a half year after conversion to an engine on a workshop - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do .
even in customer interest , it is important to avoid that there are in any other damage , which does not have nothing to do with the w@@ aning sc@@ andal , to an im@@ itable regard to possible cav@@ ali@@ tions , as it was called .
therefore we do not use the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from rich as@@ parag@@ us in future criminal prosec@@ ut@@ ches - as a second Institute in Germany .
Motorsport Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers who are 40 million euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bundes@@ verband Deutscher banks speaks of an individual and does not see a signal : normal as@@ parag@@ us would have to pay &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to pay for their austerity criminal prosec@@ ution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
stor@@ ing banks money on night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay its 0,4 percent criminal law .
this fee demands the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate clients for deposits over 100,000 Euro on Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily accounts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first 100.000 euro are free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 guaranteed 400 euros in the year &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has been lifted from a day of 40 million euros , which could be lifted from one day on the other and which he could not be dis@@ able .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0,4 percent cost , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chef . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can not lay down for every million 4000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs will now give the costs according to the notification principle .
the cas@@ h@@ ated simply into the saf@@ es of the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank , would be much too dangerous , &quot; I already experienced it already four over , I may not yet the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bank@@ note stood . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the co@@ operative association of Bavaria explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the extreme political course of the ECB is causing significant costs at all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they alone to wear , be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; working @-@ economic permanently not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , which I set by Si@@ ster Ray ( data controller : eight young women , three men middle ages ) into the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( meaning : eight men middle ages , one woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collectors , I ask ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I guess already &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have ca . 3.000 or 4.000 plates .
these sound@@ boards , top ( he sent me the sn@@ apshot by e @-@ mail , I am not sent to him at home ) , dress the walls of his sitting room .
the reason why he poss@@ esses such a considerable number of albums and sing@@ les , is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy plates , which he could not afford as they appeared , and again items that were sold , when he was young and bank@@ rupt .
&quot; many things I bought from the late 60s , early 70@@ ies that appeared , when I was 11 or 12 I was . things that I was probably something to young in order to buy them , &quot; says he .
he agre@@ es that those who are buying , rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and will be happy to spend time , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much .
this is my l@@ aster .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at Si@@ ster Ray , believes that many customers meet , which he meets on the You@@ Go@@ v &apos;s Profile .
however , it also has a new wave of people who have influenced by the meditation people who have heard about the com@@ eb@@ ack and to illu@@ strate their old sheets .
by the talks I have managed to have people around 1998 or 1999 of their collection .
customers who are once selling their records to buy CDs now , sell their CDs to buy their records , &quot; says it .
this would explain the boom to tra@@ ilers of the turn@@ tables of a particular age .
but what about the emoti@@ on@@ ical significance of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like ph@@ onica to recognize that turn@@ around has a so@@ othing community of par@@ agli@@ der .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older clients participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some turn@@ tables feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to withdraw themselves to the stability of confidential sound @-@ envel@@ opes , of objects , the happ@@ en@@ it@@ ers watch@@ ings .
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a emp@@ tin@@ ess or possession of material possession as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; says WE@@ Z .
this is the case for me as collectors and I think there is so many people in many people .
it is a simple way to deal with mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ ills a staff of a plate p@@ iles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of IC@@ M in April un@@ covered that almost 50 % of the people , the last month have bought a record , they have not yet heard .
the survey took out that 41 % own turn@@ tables we never use , while 7 % of those who own a record , no record player .
at this time of the last report I would probably look very concerned while I flo@@ ur@@ red by a st@@ acks at Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , which is working at Sounds of the Universe ( Print@@ ed : three men middle ages ) , has noticed a &quot; Tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the Re@@ vi@@ vals .
&quot; someone came only recently here again and said , &quot; I had no turn@@ tables , but I would like to buy a radio head record , so that I can put them into the shelf , he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it is definitely going .
more produ@@ kt@@ own , less musi@@ c@@ ous .
we have people who say : &quot; I have no turn@@ tables . &quot;
these are younger people , not older , who only slowly come up .
f@@ p that has dedicated to the sound@@ boards almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience , when I re @-@ wo@@ e .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists , the photos make , Teen@@ y and women middle ages .
even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed as in the above @-@ mentioned stores - Wild Be@@ ast latest pop instead of experim@@ ental Jazz instead of experim@@ ental Jazz dr@@ on from the lou@@ d@@ speakers - it is good to see such a di@@ fication at the customer .
none of them looks very lon@@ ely lon@@ ely , but nag@@ ar psych@@ ic trau@@ mat@@ a are difficult to det@@ ectable when you stand beside someone 30 seconds long .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running in business for several minutes and consider the variation of the sale available for sale .
it makes more of a man@@ nequ@@ ins than a big one .
it does not deserve much , so the collector of plates is not a real option , says it .
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or to another way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; it drives with a dre@@ ad s@@ igh .
I don &apos;t know how I supposed to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last H@@ alt is a business of which is said that a new generation of turn@@ tables have to be inspired : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I give the An@@ y , the Je@@ ans @-@ Hot@@ p@@ ants to Mu@@ sters , watching a group of young teenage cameras , group@@ ed for a moment for pol@@ ish cameras , before a father and daughter are superior to buy a cro@@ sl@@ ey turn@@ tables .
on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Ad@@ ele , J@@ eff bu@@ ckl@@ ey , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fl@@ e@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
nobody sees itself in - perhaps because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to grasp it .
it is pure &quot; turn@@ around . &quot;
but considering that every attraction for these objects mean more money for the industry and to send some customers to the depths so@@ hos for more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain .
there is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money as others , also the one that is most for luxury homes such as plates .
even if my neigh@@ bor came , that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree , let them at least in record stores in Soho , the great number of female collectors and turn@@ tables that exist in reality , turn@@ key and in online .
these people probably operate hard at school or in offices .
they spend their Thursday tomorrow with safety on foot through turn@@ around of the Ber@@ wick Street and the sc@@ roll by plates , while taking the star@@ red view of an unc@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ a false moder@@ ator p@@ li@@ ds , which is dominated by the shoul@@ ders of nothing short middle ages .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Calais ar@@ gu@@ ed that these places would be Dutch , because they would represent a parallel economy out of which no taxes would be paid and that is a fire@@ works and hum@@ ble risk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
humanitarian groups shared the court with that the shops and restaurants are important , since the free meals offered by the state supported association and other groups , not enough food for the growing numbers in stock .
they also brought out that the pro@@ visional business and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .

here comes the enforcement trailer
Germany R@@ aser must adapt to the next generation of speed : in various federal states , among other things in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flash releases are tested , the tem@@ ples are especially effective .
the fut@@ uris@@ tic enforcement trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden may be used for example at random , where it would be dangerous for mobile measurement through the police .
for example , on motorway tree or to switch bridges , with temporary , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure there with a stationary b@@ ills for compliance with speed control .
but a continuous structure can be too dangerous or consuming .
the enforcement trailer is aut@@ ark : his battery keeps on un@@ interrupted operation , five days , the Fall@@ data is encryp@@ ted via a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be recorded via multiple tracks simultaneously .
variable speed limit , as well as through@@ put on time , ch@@ assis and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in high @-@ level condition you can move the trailer according to manufacturers with each car with trailer h@@ it@@ ch .

great Britain takes over Silver im 7 @-@ er R@@ ug@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold gets
the impressive performance of Great Britain &apos;s at 7 @-@ er R@@ ug@@ by came in the finale on Thursday evening on the last hur@@ d@@ le in the last hur@@ d@@ le in the form of the Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were be@@ aten with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ odoro stage here in Rio .
Fi@@ ji ert@@ eil@@ ed a master@@ class in handling , Side @-@ Step@@ ping , g@@ aps , f@@ uss and ro@@ her power to win gold - their first Olympics of all color .
the defeat was scattered by the not too bad Tro@@ st@@ price of the Silver med@@ al - Great Britain in this day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they sm@@ ote New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the distinct defeat of the B@@ oks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ fin@@ als on the same day could be back in the finale .
but independently of it fi@@ ji in this form a 15 @-@ man team were be@@ aten .
it could be for GB a con@@ sol@@ ation - but it will probably not - that at least one bri@@ te tomorrow will have a gold med@@ al around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is Ch@@ ef@@ trainer Ben Ry@@ an , the former leader of England from Wim@@ bl@@ ed@@ on .
it had a difficult path behind .
eight years ago they lost at Ry@@ an every game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this action is w@@ ast@@ ly , but the progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji began wonderful and left the attacks GB@@ s from fun waste .
it felt for the captain Tom Mitch@@ ell on and Co . an , as would you run in driving buses . the World Series @-@ winner went 5 @-@ 0 to top , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner of the over@@ crowded .
with even four minutes of game , Jerry Tu@@ w@@ ai was still another attack from the right corner , which he conver@@ ts .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly has the ball .
a h@@ ug@@ ged pot of Mitch@@ ell stops the mountain of Mann Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa a third gate , but it has fi@@ ji only stopped .
in the seventh minute le@@ te J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a in the right corner a touch@@ down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the revival and there was still over a minute season ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ et by further weak T@@ ackl@@ ing of the GB teams and over@@ throw up to line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to break .
it is so , when Fi@@ ji was born to have been born 7 to play during the UK too .
this is how it is .
GB led major changes to the half @-@ time by and closed the fi@@ ji@@ ic gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time , until Jos@@ ue Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilli@@ ant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan N@@ ort@@ on launched a try for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game had long been going for long in favour of the South @-@ isl@@ anders , whose fans were dropped off , flags hang@@ ers and dan@@ ces on the bl@@ e@@ ach@@ ers .
it was not difficult to admire the play@@ ful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a Vi@@ li@@ ame set the i @-@ bag with another try in recent seconds .
the p@@ ect@@ ff , the Fi@@ j@@ is embr@@ ac@@ ten itself and GB ch@@ ick@@ ed crus@@ hed in the lawn .
earlier in the days Fi@@ ji Japan had defe@@ ated Japan in the semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Great Britain in a kn@@ itted semi @-@ fin@@ s from the race - British transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the B@@ oks in the first half of the front , but Dan N@@ ort@@ on crossed the line with a impressive foot@@ work and achieved a gate below the post in the second half .
a brilli@@ ant late is del@@ ayed by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , in@@ sured the profit - and thus the Silver med@@ al .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and H@@ eather St@@ anning by fighting with cancer of the trainer
there will be no em@@ ot@@ in@@ al@@ eres gold than with these games and that will be called .
from the first rowing up to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve that go into history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and H@@ eather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only the examples that was at the Ru@@ der , there were three voices in the boat . the E@@ cho of the train@@ ee Robin Williams , was all present to the second Olympi@@ old in two without ash@@ k@@ ine in a row , the first women in the history of the British Sports that put on such a scale .
your domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all their 39.@@ ter un@@ trained use , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled .
what we see are two brilli@@ ant Ath@@ l@@ ements that gli@@ des over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ears , which does not reflect the type of tri@@ um@@ ph@@ es to G@@ än@@ ze .
behind every gold in the ruin there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of voluntary help , who make the difference and there was no one assistant as the coach , who did not know if he was diagnosed this day when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said , he ris@@ ky .
I had a bli@@ bs , the op@@ eri@@ able is and they did it .
if you do not do that , it goes anywhere .
it would have been a rather sh@@ lim@@ ome situation .
it changes a little the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the tri@@ o had happiness that he could be treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , could begin what the inter@@ ruption to a minimum in case that in such circumstances is the correct term .
I needed money , so it had to go better again soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in hospital and ran on the station around - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet on a time when they said that some steps away .
this is how it starts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is already a challenge , but that makes it too much larger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the in@@ vari@@ ability of victory , their first thought went to Williams , who spent a ner@@ ve pres@@ cri@@ mination of doing something more than usual , and tried to process his own fears .
St@@ anning , which was considered captain in the Royal Arti@@ ll@@ ery Reg@@ im@@ ent in a use in Afghanistan , &quot; I was this week a emotional wre@@ ck . that &apos;s maybe something extremely but it means so much . &quot;
it repe@@ ater only how much of me this means , how much I and Hel@@ en and also Robin did have worked .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin , we would have no one , therefore a massive thanks to him . he is the best coach in the world .
I would have no better person regarding the tray or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and H@@ eather St@@ anning have been lost in the last five years .
the pair had a hard rhythm over which their opponents were not able to keep up with their opponents .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark had finished , had a p@@ anning and glo@@ ver had a lot in reserve .
we were very at the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; lead in the process , lead in the process . &quot;
it really is important to leave itself not mit@@ t@@ ear .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not working out to do something sw@@ oll@@ es .
we did not want a fire@@ works , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race what we did .
the couple will take a time for one year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver will appear to be next week on a wedding , their own with the TV @-@ advent@@ urer and Steve back@@ shall .
now she just want to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that my last race was .
this would have been a lot of pressure .
in London it lasted about six months to concei@@ ve , that I am a Olympics .
it was all so new for me and I was so res@@ trained .
here it took about four minutes .
that feels so much better at , &quot; said she .

the drinking water @-@ house association with seat in K@@ ott@@ endorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , encourages around 15@@ 0000 Ku@@ bik@@ meter water and provides 32 places and ham@@ let with about 5500 inhabitants .

&quot; his tasks have been very varied and they cover themselves from water @-@ executive and maintenance work , the budget of office and organizational activities , the budget of fees and fees up to emergency applications at weekends , &quot; said the president .
as outstanding events , she realized the commissioning and inaugur@@ ation of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , ground@@ ing @-@ sales in the field of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers ( 1999 ) , re @-@ creation of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the survey of water lines .
there have no down@@ time and you have always recorded new features , because water life de@@ pre@@ y and drinking water is the most important food .
in their Lau@@ d@@ ati@@ o , she pra@@ ised G@@ öl@@ ler faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he used with a lot of heart flo@@ od for its water@@ way and he has lived the water@@ way of water , as if it would be his own company .
a few weeks ago , he considered a real practi@@ tion@@ ers to present the successful concept of the V@@ eit@@ ing Group in front of the Aqu@@ arius district in front of the district of the district .

the biggest challenge and the difficult application were however the pi@@ er@@ up@@ tion on the high container by Kirch@@ lau@@ ter on an 3 January .

the perpet@@ rat@@ ors are on the escape , after him I will openly discuss .
by meanwhile nation@@ wide , because S@@ ven S. could be on the road by car .
the man is about 80 meters big , mus@@ cular , brown and has a gl@@ int .
by now the police have published a photo of him .
it is however a few years old .
meanwhile the man carries a gl@@ int .
the man is not to be addressed directly .
he could still bear the weapon with itself , so the police .
who S@@ ven S. sees , the 110 should call .
the police speaks of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
the victim was the vintage 1988 , the perpet@@ rat@@ ors 1981 .
the competent police in Lübeck did not want to make any information about the Ta@@ ther@@ way or the relationship between perpet@@ rat@@ ors and victims ; they confirmed that a man was killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a k@@ illing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations for two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission was initially planned to ask the steel producer , the gases from Ho@@ cho@@ p to electricity for your own consumption , to ask for check@@ out .
the steel industry threat@@ ens the fields of German industry , additional costs from 120 to 240 million euros a year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , I now give up a base certificate with the EU Commission to talks with Invest@@ ig@@ ate Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only if the generators used in the steel @-@ works will be replaced in case of an E@@ EG @-@ Treaty of 20 per cent .
but even these will not be raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the European Commission to equity .
the status quo of the previous regulation will be largely fixed .
particular importance have the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of our campaign &apos;s campaign is the future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is that a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further must be followed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of the emissions trading are climate and employment targets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IG Metall @-@ Chief Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe suffering from the financial crisis of 2008 under over@@ head and a significant prize pressure .
last year the situation further intensi@@ fied , as the world &apos;s biggest br@@ is@@ tical China given the we@@ aker of energy consumption on the world market .
European manufacturers throw Chinese steel con@@ ges@@ tion price .
in the course of this spring , the situation has a little relaxed .
to show a hang@@ ing in@@ fu@@ hr@@ z@@ öl@@ le on impor@@ ter effect , for others the economic insight in China have up@@ set .
un@@ clear how lasting is the lau@@ re@@ petition is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ K@@ rup@@ p remained on Thursday carefully .
finally , the prizes had to be more stag@@ nat@@ ing .
the industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reduc@@ tions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ K@@ rup@@ p wanted to not end con@@ stell@@ ations of individual works also .
at the end of 2015 around 86@@ 000 people were busy at the end of 2015 .
in July the German steel producer stay in spite of rising prices and increasing orders .
they are manufactured using 3.4 million tonnes well six percent less raw than in the previous year , as the economic re@@ unification of steel on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the amount of the second month went back again .
since the beginning of the year there is the production of two percent below the previous year .
the association anticip@@ ates in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation with a rising output .
community , Spirit , health : sing sen@@ iors good
the sign of Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp already accompanied her whole life : as young girl she was in the school &apos;s choir , in the teacher &apos;s teaching , and today s@@ ings the 78 @-@ year @-@ old in an sen@@ iors @-@ choir .
&quot; singing moves me - emotional and physically , &quot; describes it .
after a sample it feels out , cheer@@ ful and a total of living , says it .
he is doing something good for doing her health and spirit .
because S@@ ingen is equal to several perspectives , a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Erhard H@@ ackl@@ er from the German Senior@@ enl@@ iga .
most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with equ@@ ated the joy of music , describes h@@ ackl@@ es .
through regular interaction , sen@@ iors can establish social contacts and maintain .
because often solve social and family structures at age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience also has the Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and organize themselves to others leave and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of interaction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , mean h@@ ackl@@ es .
because exercising sen@@ iors deep and controlled breathing .
who regularly call its l@@ ungs even in everyday life not as fast from the cr@@ ust .
even though it &apos;s about to get the sound of the voice in the age , it is an optimal hobby .
towards elderly people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , tells Urs@@ ula L@@ enz of the Federal Chancellor of the sen@@ iors @-@ organisations .
in the older generations the Joint S@@ ingen had a much higher significance , it belong@@ ed to everyday life , both in school and in leisure , explains it .
L@@ enz is often observed that the s@@ ingen or hearing of songs among older people often fur@@ ious many memories , often connected with positive po@@ sting their youth .
thanks Li@@ ed@@ tex@@ te and especially mel@@ o@@ dies themselves de@@ men@@ op@@ ed people in long back events .
when s@@ ingen the head is also requested a special performance , explains L@@ enz .
focus on their own voice and to a given rhythm and adapt the other singers - it is a great cog@@ ni@@ tive challenge .
just older people who live alone are not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one is under@@ fed by the S@@ ingen in the choir , and don &apos;t bl@@ ackl@@ es .
an inspir@@ ational audience is a great praise .
even the self @-@ este@@ em grows through the s@@ ingen in the choir .
to show yourself : when I have been doing something for something , I will strengthen better and vig@@ or over me - this experience strength@@ ens .
good reasons to begin with the singing , so there is enough .
who wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he meant to have little talent , t@@ ensi@@ on@@ less talent .
one can &apos;t sing us alone - at 50 sing@@ les people who hear when a tone goes down ?
in search of the appropriate offer , sen@@ iors have various possibilities , says H@@ ackl@@ er .
sing someone from the announcement in a home choir , you can easily connect .
many cities also offer views over the choirs in the area .
those who wants to sing in a church choir , can turn directly to the municipality or church @-@ standing .
a lot of sen@@ ench@@ men can also be found via the Internet .
anyone has no access to the internet , the family , friends or neighbours can ask for help with the internet language .
who desire has to sing , should be connected to a choir , slo@@ ping H@@ ackl@@ er .
singing is doing the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - that is true for all ages .
Cats react sensitive as K@@ ater to scre@@ ams of the young animals
Bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover , what effect the ruin of K@@ atz@@ en@@ bab@@ ys has grown on adult animals .
to her surprise the mi@@ stress also left the males not cold - however they kept in contrast to the females always alike .
female cats can recognize the arous@@ al of K@@ atz@@ en@@ bab@@ ys at the mi@@ stress of the little ones .
they respond to ten percent faster to Lau@@ te of kittens , who have found themselves in great need , how scientists have found out of the Anim@@ al University and the Medical University Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
they may also react to the ruins of kittens - however the same .
&quot; evi@@ d@@ ently the acoustic differences between the distr@@ ust of less and strongly enh@@ ances for the males either not perc@@ ep@@ tible or not of meaning , &quot; said Bi@@ olog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is first author@@ ised in the study , which was published on this Friday in the magazine &quot; B@@ MC Evol@@ u@@ tionary Bi@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a previous investigation the research team had already found that the duration and tape of the kittens with the ur@@ gency of their help .
overall , a total of nine adult cr@@ ater and eight cal@@ ories were from the shelter of the MH@@ H .
you were played for a so@@ ap of little ones which were taken for three minutes from the root box and separated by mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
for the others they were confronted with scre@@ ams of stronger kittens , which were in addition to high .
the researchers keep their results despite the low stit@@ et@@ asting for predic@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who had not yet had its own off@@ spring , rep@@ lied differenti@@ ates to scre@@ ams , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned off faster to the speaker , if this ruin the very arous@@ al kit@@ ties played .
this ability may possibly be cultivated or developed with the sexual act .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have responded to all , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in .
in the past scientists have already examined multiple reactions from women and men on baby properties .
also , some studies showed that women are sensitive to inf@@ ants , quite as if they were already mothers or not , reported the Bi@@ olog@@ in Marina She@@ ann .

H@@ ak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r is in Turkey a football Legend .
in Turkey is against the one @-@ hand so@@ cc@@ er star H@@ ak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r .
th@@ rowing it is thrown a member of a terror@@ ist group .
for the first time after the Putin &apos;s trial , Turkey takes place an important so@@ cc@@ er game in Turkey .
in front of the Du@@ ell of the Arch@@ ri@@ v@@ alen between visits Istanbul and Luke Pod@@ ol@@ sk@@ is Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya is the official line clearly : &quot; Business as &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
already in the im@@ position of the ex@@ ten@@ ders after the cr@@ ash , in July , the government , the everyday life of Nor@@ m@@ alb@@ ür@@ cher has not be affected .
this , however , does not apply to those who en@@ sus@@ pic@@ ious the movement of the pre@@ aching feature of the pre@@ aching .
it is also not made in front of football .
against the earlier St@@ ark@@ ick@@ er H@@ ak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r asked the Prosec@@ ution .
therefore , in the meantime , he was thrown in the United States in America , a terror@@ ist group of a terror@@ ist group .
Sü@@ k@@ r is supposed to be suppor@@ ters of the Pre@@ dig@@ ers Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is made liable for the president of the President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ yi@@ p Erd@@ og@@ an for the Put@@ ty .
although the first of course is valid for 90 days of suspension , nor until October , actually the life of most Tur@@ ks , but as good as no effect .
the near@@ er &quot; democracy @-@ Wa@@ es &quot; on public places throughout the country has declared Erd@@ og@@ an on Wednesday for finished .
the sport is - as the whole country - split into suppor@@ ters and opponents of earth .
especially fans of the worker club visits are traditionally not among the friends of the President .
but what the Gro@@ s of the Tur@@ ks , however , given the disc@@ othe@@ tical experience in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties .
even there are even the fans even whether their heart is stri@@ kes for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or visits .
at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala &quot; will arrive very back to Luke Pod@@ ol@@ ski .
his sporting value placed in the ex@@ pi@@ red season in the ex@@ erted season at the ex@@ pi@@ red season in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year ended his first game time as a Top@@ scor@@ er of his association .
in the end@@ game of Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he achieved the 1 : 0 @-@ winning .

he completed the season in an excellent way and secured his team of poker .
thanks to Pol@@ di &apos; found the dis@@ appoint@@ ing season for the record , a for@@ warding conclusion .
after the pre @-@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League the &quot; lion &quot; also say in the Europe League early .
in the Sü@@ per Li@@ g , there are only in rank 6 .
the season was not good .
the Pok@@ al was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is done we managed and that is the most important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pod@@ ol@@ ski &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Col@@ kt@@ as ran the game year better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who put the basis for the 14th title thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , which lay down the basis for the 14th title .
this is also the reason that fans hope to return to the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ year .
in the course of the AC Florence , the A@@ AC Florence had listed under the contract and returned to settlements Gom@@ ez after the Putin &apos;s trial , because of the political situation in the country after his EM @-@ vacation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Mario wants to come to us , he must say it just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comm@@ ented the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ick@@ er &quot; Club@@ es &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club@@ es Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;

despite mental doping - these athletes have yet medals and chances of Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year Ju@@ stin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice because of D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Jan@@ eiro - W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa must not start in Rio .
other over@@ led athle@@ tik @-@ sin@@ ner can only laugh@@ ter it - they fight in Rio around medals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intelligence determines how the impact of the Olympic Games in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian rac@@ mer@@ in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , which had gone after a doping @-@ locking their start quite briefly before playing ( 100 meters chest ) des@@ p@@ ised and explo@@ ited .
it offered a Scandin@@ avian scene : with a super@@ vis@@ ually smile it was still in the hall st@@ ol@@ ished and had prov@@ oked with their appearance .
as a stand@@ point that they will not be gold , the audience broke into a h@@ ub@@ el@@ h@@ ash .
but there are many more athle@@ te that in spite of doping - past at the Olympic Games in Rio to the start .
here an overview :
Ju@@ stin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old one of the most contro@@ versi@@ al figures in the athle@@ tics .
he was locked for two times because of D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since his spell the Olympi@@ ast@@ eger from 2004 and Ex @-@ World Champion is even faster than before , it is over 100 m in 9,80 seconds the number one of the world and is considered as the greatest challenge of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t .
shelf @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ y@@ ce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / Jam@@ a@@ ica ) : the bil@@ ing@@ ual Olympi@@ erre had to sit down a six @-@ minute margin after you have proven the intake of pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
they have had a strong dental pain after surgery , def@@ ended the 29 @-@ year @-@ old .
Sandra Per@@ ko@@ vic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : 2011 became the Olympi@@ asi@@ ve of 2012 , World Championships of 2013 and Europ@@ am@@ eister@@ schaft in 2010 to 2016 positively on the Forbidden stimulation of meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine .
Per@@ ko@@ vic tri@@ vi@@ ed the wis@@ h@@ ated intake , and was closed six months .
the four wid@@ est lit@@ ters this year will go to the account of the big gold favor@@ ed .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympics at 400 m , was positive tested and closed 21 months was closed .
a means of penis enlargement may be responsible , dec@@ ep@@ ed Mer@@ ge .
this year is 30 @-@ year @-@ ol@@ ds over 200 and 400 m of the fast@@ est man in the world .
I@@ wan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( Ham@@ mer@@ ges , Belarus ) : probably hardly any Ath@@ l@@ eten have been detected so many medals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lost Ti@@ ch@@ on his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after his testosterone level has been established . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the meanwhile 40 @-@ year @-@ ol@@ ds had to give the Olympia Silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid Cool and the EM @-@ title in 2006 due to testosterone abuse .
the also called bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ al of the Olympic Games in 2008 he received due to the court of the International Sports International Criminal Tribunal .
with 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he is on rank 2 of the world list .
Li@@ u Hong Kong ( 20 km G@@ ehen , China ) : the Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord@@ ler@@ in and Gold Coins was only tested in May positively , but can still be started in Rio .
during the 29 years old world Championships were found notes on the intake of a remaining food items found , the dispens@@ ing of the world @-@ anti @-@ doping agency WA@@ DA fell mild and ran already on July 13th .
Bom@@ mel in Thailand - Öster@@ reich@@ cher@@ in hurt - Cities T@@ ote
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stand with the wife in Contact , told the speaker of the Ministry of Finance , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Fri@@ day@@ early .
they have suffered patterns and have been treated in hospital , but I have already left again .
your home trip has been planned for the beginning of September .
whether for the further explo@@ sions on the leisure island of Ph@@ uk@@ et , as well as in the southern towns of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang NG@@ A , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on also Austrian citizen are still un@@ clear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at this respect in constant contact with local authorities , so be@@ ö@@ ll .
at around 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok nearby Hu@@ a H@@ in were initially explo@@ ded on Thursday morning in a district of two bom@@ bs .
in this case the police have been killed in Thailand and about 20 people , including Austri@@ ans in three Germans , three Dutch , and three Itali@@ ans .
on Fri@@ day@@ early next two spra@@ yers went high , so according to the authorities another man was killed .
also by Ph@@ uk@@ et was reported in the morning a bom@@ bing explo@@ sion .
at the Det@@ on@@ ation near the popular popular Bad@@ estr@@ ands Pat@@ ong was in@@ ju@@ red after police information .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the southeast coast of the country , then explo@@ ded another bom@@ b , which put a municipal law .
the spr@@ ink@@ le is gone out according to the authorities in a Blum@@ en@@ be@@ et in front of the police police in the air .
finally , determin@@ ations of ph@@ all@@ ations in Ph@@ ang NG@@ A and tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on on the southeast coast several links .
one go from one related to the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , was called it .
&quot; the bom@@ b attack carry the same man@@ us@@ cript , &quot; said Ar@@ me@@ eg@@ ener@@ al Dan@@ ai crit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Fri@@ day@@ early before journalists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are assum@@ ing that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was too early to say to possible moti@@ fs - probably it was but the action of Muslim reb@@ els .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thai media we wanted to recognize a pattern in the attacks which is typical for the bom@@ bing mus@@ cular separ@@ atis@@ ts in the south of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Thai police did not declared the attacks in relation to the Islam@@ ist insur@@ rection , or with the international terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is just a local sab@@ ot@@ age that is limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a speaker in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one is rather assum@@ ing that the bom@@ bs of enemies of the ruling military j@@ unt@@ a were laid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities would have received sec@@ rec@@ tive references to upcoming events in the south of the country - however they have not been informed about the exact time and places . &quot; &quot; &quot;
still be un@@ clear what group behind the attacks .
the police took their officials throughout the country , security around important government buildings as well as airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and am@@ us@@ ement district .
in Thailand there are still smaller bom@@ bing ra@@ inf@@ alls , but they usually do not judge tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that has been used over the years of Thailand &apos;s King B@@ humi@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the well @-@ known bom@@ bing explo@@ sions recommends the Austrian Foreign Ministry on his homepage , the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
high safety risks ( Security class 3 ) for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ iw@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and son@@ g@@ kl@@ a , as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ vian and surroundings .
according to disputes between security forces and Muslim people will not escape into these provinces .
increased safety risks ( security level 2 ) for the rest of the country .
the proposals on Thursday and Friday most sought after a few days after a contro@@ versi@@ al referendum held about one of the military j@@ unt@@ a Constitution .
this space lies with the military influence even in the years to come .
Jun@@ ta Chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said , the bom@@ bs have been an attempt to sti@@ r , while the country toward stability , an improvement in economic situation and tourism .
the military unt@@ a , who had taken the power after a phase of blo@@ ody crimes , he considers himself to have the kingdom to maintain stability and order .
however , it has not been able to have been able to get a handle for years in the extreme south of the country in the extreme south of the country .
in the conflict already more than 6500 people have been killed .
in Bangkok a year ago in Bangkok , a popular h@@ ind@@ u s@@ purely 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the blo@@ ody bom@@ bing of the younger history of the country .
the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is mer@@ ged into the vision@@ ary of the Bundes@@ minist@@ ered for constitutional protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several juris@@ dictions , the constitu@@ ent of the group have put the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identi@@ fying movement &quot; for aspir@@ ations against the non @-@ democratic basic &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; constitutional Prin@@ ci@@ ple Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the German Press agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , hi@@ red Islamic faith or the Middle East are diff@@ used from the Middle East in extrem@@ ist way .
that is why we watch the movement now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it applies to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Multic@@ ult@@ i W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Un@@ controlled mass &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of their own identity by over@@ coming &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
constitutional in nine Länder - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Nieder@@ s@@ achsen , Saxony and Th@@ ur@@ in@@ gia - watch the &quot; identity &quot; already .
Ma@@ ate said , his authority took place in the decision to be closely coordinated with the dem@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &quot; Identi@@ fication movement &quot; try to pick their target group , where it stands , &quot; said the constitutional . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generally , extremis@@ ts , she joined y@@ outh@@ ful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the identi@@ ties Islam@@ ists also as right @-@ wing extremis@@ ts .
this is not a che@@ ated advertising for your own cause .
the pro@@ paganda should speak the people emotional .
young people are there in a special way .
this is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally , it had given reports on contacts of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ate said , he did not have any results .
for constitutional protection , possible contacts of this species is only relevant from a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals , the extrem@@ ist , their goal is changing and so extrem@@ ist .
therefore , whether such individuals controls the influence of the party .
this is not visible .
with a view of the distinct increase of right imp@@ air@@ ings and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refuge@@ e people said , he would not speak with new right terrorism in this context .
but we have found in recent years that it can be legal structures .
there were the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Big Group .
it can be quite that further r@@ ens@@ ory group@@ ings or small groups form , the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refuge@@ e homes or attack from other right wing extremis@@ m .
but a clear@@ er @-@ wide or European control of squ@@ ir@@ ror@@ ism is not recogni@@ z@@ able .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recent groups have emerged on the regional level or social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried about that many over@@ s went to the account of people who did not appear before the right scene in the right scene . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the wor@@ rying .
many of the Tat@@ dig@@ s in attacks on asylum seek@@ ers are not known as cri@@ min@@ als , politically motiv@@ ated off@@ ences or suppor@@ ters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed himself with right wing extremis@@ ts at all , who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or for example CD@@ U , SPD or left @-@ elected , which can then have been forced by right @-@ right mood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes the Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always determine the Olympi@@ oni@@ cles or Wel@@ tre@@ kor@@ de the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the cour@@ ageous appearance of RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te in the Summer show in Rio de Jan@@ eiro .
in the aqu@@ atics center spon@@ ge of slightly overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slowly that he could no longer see in the TV pictures .
it disappeared and simple - no matter how far the section was selected .
in social networks was subsequently attri@@ buted to the vir@@ al Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
actually the 24 @-@ year @-@ old with a refund of 48 seconds its lead and bel@@ lied the 59@@ th place of 59 Star@@ ters .
but it was rather not a sport@@ y figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old should take part in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethi@@ op@@ ier took a special start@@ up from the international swimming Association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ presented countries .
as in Ä@@ th@@ op@@ ies , most sports run , have just wanted to do something else .
preparation is all : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te makes himself ready for the big race .
quickly made the first name name the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media made him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; RO@@ BEL of W@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in An@@ chor@@ age an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosperity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about him fun . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time he spent only with one minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters of style , played there no role .

at the p@@ umping space available for nearly 20 years old feed systems , which had to be out@@ dated nearly 20 years of operation of the first pl@@ unge line , the frac@@ tures , provides an extra charge to keep the water @-@ legal requirements even in future .
Schmidt : &quot; these extraordinary contributions came to the advanced training and maintenance costs which are taken into account according to the new calendar period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs which are charged at the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 even below the current level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stein@@ houses made clear that in the low waste water in the three machines the expenses for the operation and maintenance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether , compl@@ ained Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment costs at the se@@ wage systems in the past 20 years have stayed .

the Central Command , shortly C@@ enc@@ om , is the military headquarters in Tamp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American Mil@@ es@@ per@@ ations in the Middle East and Central Asia .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is done at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer , if bad analyses to be presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; introduced K@@ en Cal@@ ver@@ t , rep@@ lic@@ ating member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leaders in the Cent@@ Com reach the top of the organization .
the 10 @-@ sided report presents detailed problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the education of the Ira@@ qi forces .
although there are no direct notes on that government have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how Analy@@ ses exposed to pressure from its predec@@ ess@@ ation , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half year 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements made to the Congress clearly positive than the facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presented the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example there was a Cent@@ Com An@@ belong@@ ed to publicly known that a military re@@ con@@ quest of Mos@@ sul@@ s already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ su@@ l , two t@@ greatest city of Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .

the report published on Thursday is still published by more detailed findings , while the investigation will be continued during the investigation .
in addition , further investigation of the Cent@@ Com reports by the general in@@ spec@@ ulator of the Ministry of Defence .
democratic members of the Acc@@ ept@@ .@@ ek@@ om@@ itt@@ ees published on Thursday their own findings , which is some of the conclusions of the rep@@ ubli@@ ech Task Force .

&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. S@@ hip and Democrats gave to no indications for an input of the White House at Cent@@ Com analy@@ sts in terms of a &quot; specific political opinion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation of Congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
in the past August , the New York Times reported by the General@@ in@@ spec@@ ulator of the Pent@@ agon , which were recorded according to complaints from Cent@@ Com analy@@ sts .
l . C@@ m@@ d@@ r. Patrick Ev@@ ans , a press room of the Pent@@ agon , gave no reporting of Congress to report , during the investigation of Congress , while the investigation of the General@@ in@@ spec@@ ulation would still be in the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also gave that &quot; experts at times indeed diver@@ ging opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the provision of a contro@@ versi@@ al discussion of these important topics of national defense . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigation took a review of the question of a successful a@@ erial campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a rule that is now being made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defence .

Mr. H@@ ook@@ er also played a key role in the insur@@ rection of the current coverage of the Islamic State .
last year , the team of Mr. H@@ ook@@ er represents no significant impact on the government of air arrangements against the Islamic State against the Islamic State against the financial government , since these pro@@ visional refin@@ ement were taken into operation since these pro@@ visional refin@@ ement would have taken to sell oil on the black market .

one day after they had shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field @-@ ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday against India that w@@ aged US with 3 @-@ 0 .
five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said , they could not remember that ever have done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said she . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was not part of the people who keep their gates on memory .
that knows it : the thir@@ teen doors at 4 @-@ 0 in the ol@@ ymp@@ ic competition and are equal in their group with the British in the first place , which remain un@@ be@@ aten according to her 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will encounter the first round in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which both inside their group will gain the first and second place in each group .
the fir@@ med will run the strong Dutch , somewhat longer out of the way that the other group will lead .
as well as the game may go on Saturday , the Americans have triggered by their success story a surprise , four years after she land@@ ed over the last London Games on the last of 12 places .
B@@ AM was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a Hock@@ ey@@ ep in hands ( their two older sisters played the sport on the Dre@@ xel university ) , with 16 years , she became the National Park of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
they missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 as they could not qualify for the cad@@ res .
then the year 2012 came to them for her and her team .
in the next year , Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , Trainer of the National Bank and thus began to turn things to better .
&quot; a culture change , a mental transition and an bodi@@ ly change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we did not have the work@@ space in London that we now have .
we can move the ruin .
on Thursday morning , B@@ am opened the Tor@@ re@@ igen in the first half of the game with a back@@ drop out of the area .
India had gone without victory in the tournament in the game , but the team showed herself surprisingly , and stood the play level of 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am the game took into their hands .
she completed a Spr@@ int with the fl@@ sh@@ allow ball over the left side , then moved into the middle and l@@ up@@ tions the ball into the gate to get an 2 @-@ 0 guide .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ zal@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the door@@ ke@@ eper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs who had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the Tramp@@ oline
wherever you are also , as late it is , it is the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Jan@@ eiro are well @-@ resistant and und@@ eni@@ able , a quick season between competition and endeav@@ ours .
it is , when the Olympic b@@ ack@@ el itself would be a br@@ enn@@ an st@@ ab that is like to protect from the Ar@@ mb@@ ru@@ st@@ ment to the s@@ wimm@@ ers to the son .
you cannot turn the TV , a newspaper read or listen to the conversation of your neighb@@ ors in the qu@@ eue , without using Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ y and the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le c@@ los .
and then there are log@@ on Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey which is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s warm with dim@@ ples , could possibly have been sent to the Prime Time , built to the Prime Time , built by sponsors and well @-@ being @-@ TV advertising , if he was a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Tur@@ ner or even F@@ ell would be .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fighting in the ol@@ ymp@@ ic tr@@ amp@@ oline um gold .
the Olympic Fl@@ ame were not illumin@@ ated any event equal .
further from the center , partly in the shadow are the sports , which are not generally recognized : air shooting , Archery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always swim the chest and may have long reign .
but if I might make a mod@@ est arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then allow me the attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the tr@@ amp@@ ol@@ ins .
although the tr@@ amp@@ ol@@ n@@ jumping has already been a ol@@ ymp@@ ic event since 2000 , it was the last 16 years so pointed , that many that I had asked that there is at all a Olympi@@ ast@@ port@@ art .
this could also be regional Ig@@ ored .
although the US athletes , it has never won an med@@ al in the tr@@ amp@@ oline and until 2012 had had a athletes , which has made it until the end .
the Chinese and Rus@@ sians are tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian who share the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold med@@ al from London this year .
the tr@@ amp@@ ol@@ in@@ jumping has a certain outdoor char@@ me , partly because it sounds an un@@ resolved ear for a c@@ low@@ ance school than those for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should ad@@ mit that I am not an expert , but only a inv@@ ent enthusi@@ ast .
it has hum@@ orous potential - the cart@@ o@@ on@@ ous cit@@ ron of his never to end @-@ end - but also the Grazie of the turn@@ around and pig@@ s , the two sports , which are essentially united .
the word &quot; tr@@ amp@@ oline &quot; comes from the Spanish El tr@@ amp@@ oline , which means as much means as &quot; jumping mat . &quot;
emerging winner jump on a gig@@ antic tr@@ amp@@ oline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( rot@@ ating , wit@@ ty and sal@@ tos ) before they land on feet .
it is evaluated according to the official Olympi@@ ap@@ ro@@ gram according to execution , difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot;
two @-@ secondary athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , are part of each other in Rio .
the common Olymp@@ us v@@ ector is straight .
med@@ all@@ ists need to continue in their quest for gold on , faster , up@@ wards and dr@@ on , sometimes up to the goal , sometimes back and back , up@@ wards and down to the playground .
they do not only use the Zi@@ ell@@ in@@ ie or the output text , but in the television recording also another pol@@ ish goal : the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ords .
the pur@@ pos@@ eful pursuit is no@@ bles , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to sti@@ r even a spect@@ ators .
but it is also what I do even while watching this games as a bit ti@@ ring .
of it offers the tr@@ amp@@ oline a re@@ pri@@ eve .
the v@@ ector of the tr@@ amp@@ oline is above .
an exempl@@ ary movement is not the goal .
he or she pr@@ om@@ ed from , apparently we@@ ight@@ less like an astronom@@ er , goes up , then down , then ef@@ fort@@ lessly back to top .
also here is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no h@@ ectic attack on the target , no wol@@ ves into the distance , just the dre@@ am@@ y , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition among the Olympic Games can only be .
the qualifications and wo@@ unds of women will take place on Friday morning , in the stre@@ aming at 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 .
N@@ BC will be the end as part of a afternoon blocks to two days from 14.00 .
in the midst of the Olympia Man@@ ia they promise them a quiet , nice moment , one which is probably over@@ looked in general tum@@ ult .
if the unit of consciousness can only be achieved through the anxiety and the obj@@ ecti@@ fication of Ath@@ l@@ eten - as es the male US Tur@@ ner according to The Wall Street Journal recently pre@@ cip@@ her - then awaits Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey its according to air ring@@ ing , new wr@@ ists .
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long is a feder@@ ation of USA
violent protests in Ethiopia
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prot@@ esters , the political changes in Ethiopia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pointed to the enormous resistance of the government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
witnesses saying that pur@@ ity were killed during the inter@@ c@@ rank with the police at Sch@@ uss@@ i .
is Ethiopia just to break away ?
during the last ten years it was one of the stabili@@ zer countries of Africa , a solid co@@ at of the West with a fast growing economy .
but in the last few months protests against the government , the country and so far turned out to be found in ever more areas .
last week stor@@ my thousands of people on the streets and abandoned fundamental political changes .
the response of the government was un@@ mer@@ ci@@ ful by human rights organisations .
witnesses made that polic@@ emen were killed in zig @-@ armed prot@@ esters and red@@ dish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the run @-@ up @-@ all videos about the protests , which are probably off from the last or beginning of this year , show how lack of young people hit with st@@ aves , while they were forced to make a hand against a wall . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chief of the UN Authority on Human Rights is now calling for a direct investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country and in the future it will even become more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hi@@ d Ab@@ di , the project leader of the horn of Africa of the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most pop@@ ulous land of Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West .
American military and secret services work closely with the Ethi@@ op@@ ers to fight terrorism over the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get as much Western help .
Ethi@@ op@@ ian economy has expanded in a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new P@@ end@@ ler@@ ette in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ eba .
the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations , continuing the repression of the government - the opposition in the country became restricted , whereby discrimination have been brought to silence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were sent to ex@@ ile or in prison , killed or put into the des@@ erts of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; if you press people and they have no other options left except to prot@@ est , it breaks it out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lec@@ turer in Central Ethi@@ op@@ ies .
the entire youth prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ esters .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from the bottom of up to the wor@@ shi@@ fts in terms of power of the government .
after a spacious choice of last year the ruling party and its allies received the last headquarters of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time the tensions along the border with Er@@ it@@ rea ; a fight for this z@@ ens , contro@@ versi@@ al line in June hundreds of life .
analy@@ tics advoc@@ ates that separ@@ atis@@ ts like the Oro@@ mo @-@ liber@@ als front or the National liber@@ als of the O@@ g@@ aden , which were more or less imposed in recent years , the tur@@ mo@@ il sho@@ oters and arm@@ ing themselves again .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of age in front of the surface now explo@@ de .
the first seems harm@@ less : smart@@ phones .
only in recent years have been very ke@@ ep@@ ards in the situation to communicate with the social media as bill@@ ing smart@@ phones are more frequently used and improved the internet services .
even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , especially in prot@@ est , many people can still communicate via internet @-@ pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they keep up .
several young composers so that they gathered themselves so too prot@@ est .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity among the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ines in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
since Ä@@ ons prosp@@ eri@@ ed the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from eth@@ th@@ op@@ ian mainly Christian high@@ lands , in politics and economics , while they are the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and are living in flat country areas .
but even this is changing just .
&quot; we are in doing so , under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos .
the largest protests found in areas of Am@@ h@@ ara and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have dominated the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which are about 6 percent of the population and those in the military , in the secret services , in trade and politics .
the third reason for the rest is the death of Mel@@ es .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former vine @-@ leader , was up to his death in a non @-@ known illness in the year 2012 17 years of Ethiopia .
he was viewed as a tac@@ tical geni@@ us , a man who could think of corners .
analy@@ sts say that he was especially se@@ aled in it , early signs of dis@@ cont@@ ent@@ ment and special Ombud@@ sman to edit opponents and make them un@@ harmful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime is lacking in this fundamental act , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethi@@ op@@ ian new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected for relatively secondary reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Nord@@ Ethi@@ op@@ ian , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am from the South .
analy@@ sts say that he does not have the confidence of the tig@@ ray controlled safety services .
many fear that the result will be more blo@@ od@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia was born such a mo@@ il in 2005 , after thousands of choices prot@@ ested , according to the information of analy@@ tics were se@@ ated by the government and subsequently st@@ olen .
during the following raid , many prot@@ esters have been killed , although there were less than in the past months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly over .
development of expert @-@ lob@@ ster leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new P@@ end@@ ler@@ edition , as well as for their meas@@ urable advances in fighting poverty .
but obviously this is not the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ conception of the Ethi@@ op@@ ian government .
and she takes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month gri@@ ps prot@@ esters in gon@@ dar , a am@@ har@@ ian city , of tig@@ ers @-@ operated shops and the hat@@ red against the Tig@@ ray in the social media is always more common .
analy@@ tics say that the protests and other Western associations in a peculi@@ ar position will bring .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dr@@ on@@ aire @-@ flights over the neigh@@ bou@@ red Somalia , even if they recently appears that it has closed this base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the West wants to support democracy clearly , he does not want to summar@@ ize that his turn into an already vol@@ ati@@ al region is coll@@ ision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin gr@@ at@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his claim to Obama was founded IS@@ IS &apos; Sar@@ k@@ ner . &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to disp@@ er@@ se on Friday the last contro@@ vers@@ y sur@@ faced his campaign by giving his multiple re@@ peti@@ tive claim , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder of &quot; Terr@@ org@@ per Islamic State , not seriously meant .
this clari@@ fications thre@@ w new questions about the communication skills of the presidential data of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans whether in the situation be clear and understand@@ able with the American public .
it also brings its contribut@@ ors that make an effort to take him during an event@@ ful stage in protection to explain in the peculi@@ ar position to explain which he could not meant to be .
after having made the poster during an election campaign , Mr. Tr@@ ump in regards to the statement on Thursday and consi@@ sted in interviews that he really does not intend to indicate , the president and Mrs. Clinton would have created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning twe@@ et on Friday I said Mr. Tr@@ ump , he was simply s@@ ark@@ astic .
the Twe@@ et was the opposite to the previous day , where Mr. Tr@@ ump in a number of interviews said , he said the all@@ egation absolutely seriously .
when the conserv@@ ative radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator H@@ ug@@ h He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump will help him to we@@ aken him that Mr. Obama will destroy it , the Republi@@ can Presidency wanted nothing to know about it .
the last storm of cri@@ as@@ as@@ hed on Mr. Tr@@ ump came to Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tries to direct the focus of his campaign on the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton stopped in speeches for the economic situation in Michigan in this week .
on Friday I tried to return Mr. Tr@@ ump again to this topic .
on Twitter , he war@@ ned that Mrs. Cl@@ int@@ ons would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defence .
at the end of July he moved strong criticism to himself as he said , Rus@@ sians should be Mrs. Cl@@ int@@ ons E@@ mails , however he explained later &quot; Nat@@ ür@@ lich , I said the s@@ ark@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ al boundaries in politics and then return to too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s one of its methods to test how certain messages of his fans will be recorded , as they arrive , and then if necessary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ruth Tyler , a communication appeal , which are observed in the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I also believe it is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of shar@@ p@@ ens the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump have believed , Mr. Tr@@ ump have passed a lot of her tone since his re @-@ time has gone forward .
a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist who was published on Friday , showed a guided tour with great lead in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ at @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump generally tried to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ alist statements , he acc@@ uses his critics often , his statements to dist@@ ort or compreh@@ end his humor .
but while he is strengthening the focus of attention during the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps is brought his loyal co @-@ bed into the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ ok@@ ant may also be his statements too .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one by Tr@@ ell@@ prominent Für@@ st , gave great effort to defend the candidates today in a C@@ NN &apos;s interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are leg@@ i@@ time , political comments &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani therefore he asked to the accuracy of Mr. Tr@@ ack@@ statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton have founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that Obama was an almost un@@ familiar , small organization , he called her back@@ rests , completely false , and therefore it happened because he moved the troops from Iraq .
most Ma@@ instre@@ am @-@ Republi@@ can try to ar@@ gu@@ ed that the government served under Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton as an Extern@@ al Minister , IS@@ IS allowed to break down the situation in the Middle East aggressi@@ vely under control .
in front of the elect@@ oral campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump has continued his attacks on the media and cast them to each of his words , and be taken against him .
he den@@ ied the &quot; poor , j@@ am@@ eful &quot; TV expert , which try to understand him and said , &quot; you can not do it ! &quot;
some of the demo@@ c@@ rats sp@@ elled about Mr. Tr@@ umps exc@@ uses as only one more proof that he was in@@ appropriate for the president .
once presented at the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point comes back
Ver@@ b Cafe was a fantastic café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , in which one could pay only cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years I had good coffee .
of course it was surrounded by the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ front .
the business so@@ ap Ch@@ erie , the Ver@@ b in summer 2014 replaced , sold so@@ ap in the form of C@@ up@@ lift .
indigenous people as the last loss in an Argent@@ inian city .
the artist in Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ ian wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I can still not believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea hotel except and has now a so@@ ap shop . &quot;
but when New York change is , then it is also new .
a re@@ bel@@ ent Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere .
the coffee is also still good .
the new owner of the Ver@@ b is C@@ isco Rodr@@ igu@@ ez , a long @-@ term staff of the old cafes , the owner and managing director of the new cafes .
he started working in 2001 with Ver@@ b and remained there until the end .
when a customer offered a customer , money for a new recei@@ vers , he was excited to do it , he said .
Ferr@@ er ez , 36 , very much at .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the Bag@@ els bought the same Esp@@ res@@ som@@ asch@@ a model .
it even uses the same tor@@ ches from the old one .
but Rodr@@ igu@@ ez said that he also wanted to experim@@ ent .
he led new ingredients .
on the menu are Sand@@ wi@@ ches with bac@@ on and cheese and there is clo@@ ves like cap@@ ers and su@@ ed oni@@ ons .
there are Natur@@ circular bow@@ ls .
the café served no beer more , for this there are fresh s@@ aps .
after nine months I said Rodr@@ igu@@ ez that he noticed a st@@ um@@ ed stream of old can@@ als .
&quot; many old customers have also been pus@@ hes through prices of Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
recently on a Sunday she was Oli@@ v@@ eira a such client .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , dwelt earlier in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the Ver@@ b regularly .
even after having moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way to himself .
after the cra@@ b had closed , they gave a while the coffee ring on , told them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; me was clear that it was at the coffee and the culture in the Ver@@ b , which fell to me , &quot; said she . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she d@@ kt her again coffee , even if she ordered at this day instead of her usual t@@ ced coff@@ ees a Bl@@ ends C@@ hai Tea ordered which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 was another long @-@ term and accurate customer .
he went there before the work and ordered un@@ we@@ al@@ ably always the same .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket clock and prepare my Ever@@ y@@ thing @-@ Bag@@ el with butter , he said .
photo Rodr@@ igu@@ ez said , he wanted to experim@@ ent and get new ingredients in the menu .
nowadays , Ros@@ enthal still receives its usual order , but sometimes it changes its Ever@@ y@@ thing @-@ Bag@@ el with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodr@@ igu@@ ez said that he doesn &apos;t have a Gro@@ ll that the so@@ ap has taken the old business room .
indeed , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie on , a special so@@ ap for cra@@ b with the cold @-@ red coffee of the cafes as an ingre@@ dient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go into their offering , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodr@@ igu@@ ez &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have accepted the café also accepted .
a new customer has translated the menu into the Polish and Rodr@@ igu@@ ez said that he has prepared to make them soon , so that his new neighbours are welcome .
the site also has further advantages .
a local Saf@@ t@@ place wants to fill and sell coffee in bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the café on a notified building is expanding .
for many customers a new Ver@@ b is sufficient to get their old favorites .
Joseph W@@ itt was tri@@ ck and said that he was destroyed at the ground as the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ it said that the Bet@@ ter of the Lok@@ als and the cut@@ ters have a new coffee like a hom@@ ecom@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had to sm@@ ell , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich@@ est meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his climb to the president , Franklin Del@@ ano Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt his lunch in the O@@ val Office .
as an Fein@@ schm@@ ecker , President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt a Fai@@ ble for ing@@ eni@@ ous Del@@ ik@@ at@@ essen the Fi@@ fth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland Water@@ tor@@ tie soup .
his menu on this day was something mod@@ est : filled eggs in Tom@@ at@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , mas@@ hed and as dessert a pl@@ ough p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act culinary solidarity with the people &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histori@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Chinese food in the US , while Zi@@ egel@@ man told in her book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about life in a residential house at the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your latest cooperation , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in the Har@@ per Verlag , illustr@@ ated the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity , when they met with a re@@ por@@ ter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich shop for dinner , a small , schn@@ ing k@@ ell@@ os@@ em Im@@ bis@@ s in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has already been in business since the stock market .
Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese with Oli@@ v@@ enst@@ ück@@ chen , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with pot@@ ato and vegetable ate .
as the Rep@@ or@@ ter h@@ uns , this found the pair of a discussion of the food in the era of Great Depression suitable .
&quot; rich food were very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man .
there was stra@@ in@@ flow bro@@ t , living cheese and Bohn@@ en@@ bro@@ t .
they have been prepared from an ingre@@ dient and some fine @-@ quality that are the ingre@@ dient .
imagine making so many pe@@ anu@@ ts to eat that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ e gr@@ ins@@ te .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has to be placed in the stomach like B@@ lei , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression of the table was the table in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You Can @-@ E@@ at @-@ Buffet .
cre@@ ws of women co@@ ats for male field @-@ workers and it was fres@@ hly b@@ aked past@@ ed for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were the Americans who sent during the first World War food to hungry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shows the paths that the country went with it , no longer the slaugh@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time , in the food for the Americans a central , an@@ ed theme was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beg@@ und@@ ed Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as ten@@ se was the new Bud@@ di@@ ers : mysterious foods such as Br@@ ote and Kas@@ ser@@ ollen were sub@@ sist@@ ent , the Kas@@ ser@@ ene as &quot; wonderful species , Es@@ sens@@ ory re@@ funds , &quot; mer@@ ged Zi@@ egel@@ man , since chefs sp@@ appe@@ tite found under a creative sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by bill@@ ig@@ eres dryer .
meat , the years of the center of the American cuisine was , became a rare of the fourth luxury .
peculi@@ ar mix@@ tures have been tried , since an cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nour@@ ishing satisfaction has priority to taste or even healthy kitchen .
while their research for the book , which also includes recipes , prepared a dish from this epoch , dr@@ ack@@ ed oni@@ ons with pe@@ anu@@ t butter
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no popular commitment on lunch &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ mann goes on from : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ anu@@ t butter and b@@ aked oni@@ ons are not fit to each other .
it was typical for many of the households .
as never before or since then , ex@@ agger@@ ated household , including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 up to 1943 - the eating habits of the country .
by adding the recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , encouraging them to become &quot; bud@@ dies , and the challenge to transform them as cre@@ m@@ ige sp@@ aghetti with car@@ r@@ ots in delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a celebration of historical treat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially tasty reports on the response of the government to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ cakes @-@ food @-@ attitude .
while he has publicly called the simple I@@ owa farmers in the kitchen of his kitchen , it is like the milli@@ meter man of the world to which he has become .
&quot; he mo@@ ose continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in a almost g@@ ild@@ ed menu and carried a smo@@ king .
he was brilli@@ ant @-@ realistic .
President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt might have committed the same error if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or him it was asked to stat@@ u@@ ate him with his stomach .
as described in the book the an@@ chor@@ us of a hou@@ se@@ wing with no interest in flav@@ ours by Mrs Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt , that the White House brought the boring house in Washington but also one of the most trop@@ ic preparation . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression to deal with food was rejected as soon as the country came back to the legs .
leg@@ acy is based on our advanced focus on cal@@ ories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as on how science was applied to food .
the couple gave to better understood when writing the book the essence of Zi@@ egel@@ mans mother @-@ in @-@ law - for example how they could not throw the food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ man remin@@ ded : &quot; you made people really sick . &quot;
there was the wind@@ surfing .
after the dish at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s ab@@ duc@@ ted , they went and co@@ e a dessert that they brought home at home : the pav@@ ement , the president Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt to noon .
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man , and added that it was a common tri@@ ck , hum@@ ble recipes that send a name name to miss .
there was no stor@@ ehouse , only pl@@ umbing , some flour , sugar , water and c@@ inn@@ amon .
each emerg@@ es a bit contradic@@ tory a sp@@ oon in the ten@@ ants , brown @-@ tri@@ bun@@ al .
surprisingly , it was not bad .

in the bom@@ bs attack : he was the hero of Al@@ ep@@ po
he sat his own life on the game to help others : K@@ hal@@ ed Om@@ ar .
he was the hero of Al@@ ep@@ po : K@@ hal@@ ed Om@@ ar h@@ me@@ te his life in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others the life .
now is the 30 @-@ year @-@ ol@@ ds themselves with a fac@@ bom@@ bs attack of the Assad @-@ regime .
Om@@ ar was a member of the &quot; White Hel@@ per , &quot; a civil society group , which saved the image of almost 6@@ 0,000 people alive today .
2900 volunteers have their own life on the game to attract people out of bom@@ b houses and to make the first aid in the war .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Om@@ ar was the face of the group : a video of the civi@@ liz@@ ations that shows him during a 11 @-@ hour rescue from a house , he went to the world .
it made the sy@@ rer to the lumin@@ ous symbols in the Gre@@ ys of the war .
as a hero he never seen himself , &quot; according to picture : &quot; for me this is the true Ji@@ had . &quot;

shortly before Om@@ ar himself fell on an attack on the victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ bing ra@@ ils in Syria .
the hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter have taken four ven@@ bom@@ bs over the 4th adia district , one was filled with Ch@@ l@@ org@@ as .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from resp@@ ir@@ ation .

Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ing : the oldest wh@@ tier is almost 400 years old
blessed sight .
the Gre@@ enland usually come only in winter to surface .
this shar@@ k was allowed to go back into the sea after an examination on board ship .
he was born and flo@@ ating with well a 1 km / h through the Nor@@ dat@@ lan@@ tik - until today .
Gre@@ enland received only 150 years old and grew .
with the swi@@ v@@ ast@@ ness of the Gre@@ enland in the bottom of the nor@@ dat@@ lan@@ ti@@ ks , in an hour he reaches an average just 1.@@ 220 meters wide .
only when it comes to , acceler@@ ates the five meters long animal at sat@@ te 2,6 km / h - and is half as fast as a Rob@@ be .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this of long @-@ term lifestyle seems to be a patent for a high age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Science &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least by a Gre@@ enland shar@@ k , the 392 years old could be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; mad@@ ness &quot; , comm@@ ented Alexander Sch@@ eu@@ p@@ one from Max @-@ Plan@@ ck @-@ Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock this life @-@ span that means a World Record .
although the Evol@@ u@@ tions@@ bi@@ ologist already assumed that Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie stone are being painted .
only lack@@ ed the evidence .
Gre@@ enland ha@@ ie are difficult to watch , finally they live mainly in the ice cream from the thin coast of Canada , Gre@@ enland , Norway and Sp@@ its@@ bergen .
because they prefer water temperature around the six degrees Celsius , they dive at the surface usually only in winter .
about the lifestyle of the Gre@@ enland they know researchers according to little .
your Zeit@@ te@@ up@@ emp@@ o Ma@@ ier she , when she uses six animals in front of the sh@@ out@@ ing six animals with a transmitter .
boot@@ y make this shar@@ ks nevertheless : in the stomach of a beast , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another had the pine trees of a young ic@@ eb@@ ears .
possibly du@@ mb@@ ing them as@@ le@@ ep animals or pat@@ rol on the basis of the Eis@@ me@@ eres and seek Kad@@ aver , which were tor@@ ches from higher layers below the bottom .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues studied 28 Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ha@@ y , fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Gre@@ enland or S@@ val@@ b@@ ard as appl@@ y@@ ing from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the biggest 502 cen@@ tim@@ eters .
to determine the age of the animals , analy@@ zed it with the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ method the sp@@ ins@@ enk@@ er of the hair .
this centre of the ey@@ lens is already being built before the birth of the Ha@@ ie , which are contained therein no longer renewed .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a much carbon @-@ off @-@ 14 in the L@@ ins@@ enk@@ ern .
your birth should therefore lie after the early 19@@ 60s when nuclear weapons are looking for greater quantities of this radio@@ active carbon @-@ carbon in the atmosphere .
in which with 220 cen@@ tim@@ eters in length of the smallest animal contained in the l@@ ins@@ enk@@ per on the contrary , it is likely to have a low over@@ ride on carbon @-@ off @-@ 14 from the nuclear power , it might be celebrated his 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all major atro@@ op@@ ha@@ y had a normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities in their L@@ ins@@ enk@@ ern against the normal carbon quantities , which arises from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere . &quot; &quot; &quot;
actually the carbon @-@ clock has shown the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock for a 493 cen@@ tim@@ eters in the Gre@@ enland an age of 335 , while the record @-@ shar@@ k with 502 cen@@ tim@@ eters even 392 years old might be .
that Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ing female came only then off@@ spring if they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers of the length could be assigned an age .
since one of the animals with 392 cen@@ tim@@ eters probably stood at the thres@@ hold of the sexual ri@@ pe , and his age was determined with 156 years , Gre@@ enland can obviously become at least one @-@ half centuries of time .
also this is likely to be called Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live mainly in icy waters life is no co@@ incidence .
even the previous record @-@ holder , a 211 years old Gre@@ enland Gre@@ al , in whose che@@ que on the N@@ acking is a 120 years old resin @-@ tip , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures there is often also the organism of the there living animals living at as@@ parag@@ us .
so they mature later - and al@@ erts s@@ lower .
to keep in cold water warm , the animals are also particularly big .
for the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal heat .
the heat loss of one gram are therefore much larger than with a grams of eleph@@ ant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one @-@ smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on as much as possible as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains the evolution of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evolution &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very big animal should invest in a long life against it .

Jewish director leaves Berlin Hotel , because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed by &quot; Arabian &quot; - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ sel@@ ects a media release after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin has no Israeli pre @-@ election since there would be Arab guests according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lan@@ z@@ mann , author of the Hol@@ oc@@ ex@@ Docum@@ entation &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; caused his trouble in Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by giving an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay Lan@@ z@@ man tried to find Israel on the site of the hotel .
however , the country was not listed between the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it in the year 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lan@@ z@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ inc@@ si Bristol offers a way to choose Israel over a private call center .
after a statement look for the director at the hotel &apos;s reception .
the answer that he received there , &quot; sho@@ cked him , &quot; as Lan@@ z@@ mann wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel is employed that the measure is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; final decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels be &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it was , sol@@ u@@ ble in the director even more W@@ ut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have requested that the pres@@ election will be deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; became quot@@ ed by Lan@@ z@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Israeli Ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov h@@ adas trading called a &quot; great shame &quot; , reports the South German newspaper .
we were ent@@ ated by this event and trou@@ bled .
this is really very sh@@ am@@ eful .
the fact that this is available in Germany in exactly this hotel chain , it is even greater shame .
that requires no explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inci@@ dent solve a rather large response from the internet , in which the people became a sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some under@@ lined the Kemp@@ inski Hotel , that it could have been given to an extraordinary meeting of Arab guests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the name was shown in another post , in which it was noted that the hotel , which is located on the no@@ d@@ ently Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a Synago@@ gue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel proved to all in@@ noc@@ ence from themselves and called the inci@@ dent a &quot; verse &quot; and &quot; ap@@ olog@@ ised &quot; at Lan@@ z@@ mann , reports the mirror .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; Israel does not put into the quick@@ set list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the southern German newspaper a spok@@ es@@ person of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the site has been added now .

Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner over@@ ms at home , as Bri@@ ck gold for cycling .
Scotland &apos;s Call for Sk@@ inner in the Cap@@ od@@ rom @-@ Spr@@ int in Cap@@ od@@ rom in Rio to glory , when the British team def@@ ended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ ol@@ ds from Glasgow took the An@@ ker@@ role that his Land@@ smann Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made himself to E@@ igen . the J@@ ant and made the leg@@ end so he was asking for a victory of the favorites New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory for four years ago , while Ho@@ y brought the fifth of six Olympi@@ ag@@ old@@ med@@ a@@ glasses .
you re@@ peti@@ tive the tri@@ ck after it took place in March at the rail world Championships in London despite the back of Ho@@ ys just a mod@@ est sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the An@@ dri@@ ers Jam@@ ie &apos;s Staff .
they did so in time as a Hin@@ ter .
Ho@@ ys glory Bo@@ ck a gap , the Ki@@ eb@@ Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton try to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man , with whom they remained , when they saw their potential in the r@@ otting , which has now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ ter , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y si@@ eg@@ ten - and Sk@@ inner put in the qualification rounds a Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord , but in the feet of the New Year in the first round .
and the British Tri@@ o won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ ter laid back shortly after his round , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and sk@@ inner it remained .
a Strateg@@ ic change made a large part of the transformation , in the execution of a higher gear to make him lost and it identi@@ fies the tempo and above all sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y saw from his position as the BBC expert for and fell Sk@@ inner , Fre@@ y and Hin@@ ter , than this on the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirty comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am only here to do my best and make me a name .
we have placed at the du@@ dr@@ unde a Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord and defe@@ ated the World Champion .
it was just amazing .
there is no better way to win this .
after the tri@@ umph of 2012 at the side Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys gave Hin@@ ter that he fell down after a weak start on the train .
he moved this statement later and there was no claim of England ri@@ vals .
in such an over@@ rag@@ ing victory there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels all the GB flags along the tri@@ b@@ yp@@ e as London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we are so bad for so many world tit@@ els so bad , it was incredible to win back at the Olympi@@ ad .
this is an event , a gold med@@ al for the nation , the seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the past five months is that we expect successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the form of passwords it is in the area of the possible that he &apos;s Ho@@ ys victory of three ol@@ ymp@@ ic gold med@@ a@@ glasses in a competition repeated .
this would have been born for Kenn@@ y - who was born exactly 12 years of younger than Ho@@ y , which was also born on 23 March ( a apparent right date for British sport ; on the day there were Steve Red@@ hat , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster ) - a total yield of six gold med@@ al and an silver med@@ al .
the k@@ ä@@ me of Ho@@ y equal .
Kenn@@ y will participate next in the Spr@@ int that starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team of the event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels somewhat lon@@ ely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he wins two more gold medals , he should be done to the k@@ nights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only med@@ al competition of the day but there was another good news for England .
Sir Br@@ mer W@@ ig@@ g@@ ins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , St@@ even Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified yourself with the fast@@ est performance in the Vi@@ erer @-@ four @-@ kilomet@@ re .
they came in 3 : 5@@ 942 at the end .
the World Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord , 2012 in London Gold won , was at 3 : 5@@ 27@@ 659 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held today on the second day of competition , where des@@ ig@@ g@@ ins with security in focus is possible .
he had taken care of the qualification before the qualification as it led to him to measure his body size .
in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , the tomorrow continued and ended , av@@ anci@@ ved Laura Tr@@ ott , Jo@@ anna Riv@@ anna Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie archi@@ soon of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord@@ s@@ zeit in 4 : 13.@@ 260 .
the GB team will be rel@@ ies on its strong rail team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to bring a bl@@ ar of medals .
after a truly extraordinary account of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London became the expectations for Rio .
it played d@@ amas in the background , so the res@@ ign@@ ation of the technical lad@@ ders Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April in the middle of Sex@@ is@@ mus@@ cular and mo@@ b@@ ing@@ ling , as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on .
however , if one sees the first evening of competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite then that the legend@@ ary call of GB@@ s , which has reached the perfect moment its climax again .
the future of the mel@@ ting of Port@@ land due to lifting power consumption
the future of the aluminium f@@ um@@ ble of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - standing on the game , since the plant ex@@ ecu@@ tives termin@@ ate the energy supply contract and thereby raise all the supply agreements , as that the net@@ worked energy enterprises .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this step was followed by the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsi@@ dies to the operation of the plant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one for 20 years of fixed sub@@ vention runs in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the area of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land stand on the game .
no less than 2000 jobs -@@ direct as well as in@@ direct - could be endang@@ ered during a closure .
in addition , it could come to domin@@ o@@ effects , as the mel@@ ting ship amounts approximately 10 percent of the total power generation of Victori@@ as .
2014 Al@@ coa the Point Henry Schmel@@ zer@@ ei , which led last year to a closing of the Angl@@ ing @-@ ea power station .
the mel@@ ting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and ris@@ ky a closing .
this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation to the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Austr@@ al@@ ischen Dollars and last because of the current price for the plant .
AG@@ L that the great aluminium f@@ um@@ mer@@ ing with his Lo@@ y Yang A power station in Lat@@ robe Valley ex@@ ert , shared with it that three other owners will announce their contracts .
the complex is mostly owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , from the Chinese company CI@@ TI@@ C and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p minor shares .
&quot; AG@@ L is assum@@ ing that the plant is still operated in Port@@ land , what another physical demand for electricity through the mel@@ ting stands , &quot; shared the company with .
AG@@ L still said that the contracts were called &quot; hed@@ gers &quot; to have come into force from November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 @-@ monthly cancellation , so that they will end 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from therefore , AG@@ L is that the contracts entered into the financial year 17 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the current supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on revenues to AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong schedul@@ ing markets for large retail price .
AG@@ L shared with the value of the Tre@@ aties already in its annual budget of $ 187 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of a cancellation . &quot;
Al@@ coa said that the decision to ex@@ clude the Tre@@ ats , the &quot; skill Alco@@ as ... the mel@@ ting and the power supply to the mel@@ ting is not inter@@ change@@ able . &quot;
the U.S. company said that it was completed in 2010 an 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , which should come into force by November this year , even if it is still a statement to be guil@@ ty , why it has come back from the contract .
analy@@ tics war@@ ts due to the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Port@@ land mel@@ ting in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near New@@ castle .
in reference to the statements of analy@@ tics at the beginning of the week , the Head of oper@@ ations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen that Port@@ land has around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts and Tom@@ ago around 900 meg@@ a@@ watts .
should both plants disappear from the market , this would mean significant reduction of demand in the &#91; current market &#93; .
and for us as generators would not be good , &quot; he said .

the Cover@@ ing of Cover@@ s followed a bi@@ zar@@ res ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ omin@@ ator family , with exception of the problem of Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ l@@ yn , as well as in the presence of all the most popular Show@@ bi@@ z @-@ On@@ c@@ els and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ry@@ an Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as they ends the cover of their sister and that ends with a classic turn : you have planned all a surprise party .
this represents the clinical trial of almost every Bir@@ th@@ day . ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; Du da@@ cht@@ est that we would have forgotten ? &quot; , with the honest@@ y of a fair@@ yt@@ ale at 8 am ( in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to take their other girl somehow to this public@@ ity .
with regard to the s@@ ept@@ ember@@ s of Vo@@ gue has begun a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans .
Lor@@ enn@@ alls big sister Kim may see what is the Vo@@ gue cover , be@@ aten ( her and her husband Can@@ ye West were looking forward to see in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the S@@ ept@@ ember@@ ment of the magazine is a le@@ ague for itself .
the S@@ ept@@ ember@@ s is for Vo@@ gue that most prestigious issue of the year .
with a girth that resem@@ bles rather a photo band as a mo@@ de@@ fl@@ ection , the issue attrac@@ ts a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ oni@@ sta were by the 832 pages of the Hob@@ zer 615 pages advertising ) .
the un@@ v@@ eil@@ ing of its Cover@@ stars is so fores@@ ee@@ able that in the last two years of the magazine is still as@@ hed before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover , Na@@ om@@ i Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ist and K@@ ate M@@ oss .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bulbs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mod@@ els &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mod@@ els &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar @-@ prize @-@ winner and Di@@ or @-@ brand @-@ brand H@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga the honour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but even in the low chance that Mrs J@@ omin@@ ator - that is described by the magazine as the &quot; break@@ through &quot; of their generation - under the former category it is in good society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these ber@@ ths are not related to famous people or re@@ juven@@ iles stars or young people from today , who know how to rot@@ ate a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even though it was all done on a den@@ omin@@ ator ) .
you are really talented women who are drawing in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once that appeared on the last cover , with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade , one of the most successful years of their career .
of course J@@ enn@@ ers success not like everyone .

these feelings aw@@ ay@@ ed up again , when the message with the show J@@ enn@@ ers came out to the Vo@@ gue cover .
but on the Mis@@ sm@@ ut seems to go back at the point .
Kendall j@@ enner is on the cover of the s@@ ept@@ ember@@ ment of the Vo@@ gue .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of the word a super@@ model .
it runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .

community centers , 16@@ 0,000 people of 16@@ 0,000 people
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the aid vulnerable of the country will be ref@@ used by the common@@ ality centers , while the industry impact on the effects of further under@@ cuts to already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land are already three of five people - mostly older people , Im@@ mig@@ rant workers , victims of violence and those who have no means of un@@ justified Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ations and similar ones - in their approach to free legal advice and legal advice .
legal services of the community , which are already over@@ stepp@@ ed up for further cuts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from June next year , that these legal centers will be further 30 percent of their federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the director of the municipal centers of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of Community centers that already become hundreds of people each year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Far@@ rell said that the situation without the lifting of the decisions of the Federal Government would only be worse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land common@@ alities are chron@@ ically financed , what does that thousands of people of important services that you need to be ref@@ used , &quot; he said .
people who leave rap@@ ture relationships , people with in@@ over@@ looked and impressive debt , families that have been dism@@ iss@@ ed by divi@@ ding , workers , the un@@ disturbed way and this collection shows that they cannot get the help you need .
the federal government will cut the means of 30 percent reduction , which means thousands of hel@@ pl@@ ess people to be forced out of Que@@ ens@@ land to cope with their legal problems without any help .
we call on the General &amp; Bundes@@ j@@ us@@ al Minister as well as Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to rel@@ im@@ itate this medium @-@ cut as soon as people can get the help which they need , with legal problems .
last year the provincial government filled their commitment , funding for legal assistance to the national average .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is now at the time to see the needs of the community centers and its customers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as well as the government Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k to invest in this important work . &quot; &quot; &quot;

new York : Donald Tr@@ umps campaign was indic@@ ted because of her has been informed that their campaign manager for North Carolina is directed at an employee who were traveling in a je@@ ep in February in February .
the inci@@ dent is described in a prosec@@ ution , which was filed on Wednesday in the inland of Charlotte by Vincent Bord@@ ini , a former software programming for the campaign in this federal state .
Bord@@ ini had wa@@ ited , monthly el@@ ang , that the matter would be regulated intern@@ ally before he realized that &quot; that would not happen . &quot;
the Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ leiter , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; moved a pi@@ stol , put his right po@@ inter to the withdrawal , and r@@ amm@@ ed the run in Vinc@@ ent Kni@@ ek@@ throat , &quot; was Bord@@ ini in his acc@@ us@@ ation .
after spending on the local and regional struggle line , Bord@@ ini , that he had made the same experience with Ph@@ illi@@ p had made the same experience with Ph@@ illi@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be ri@@ mental to al@@ ign damage &quot; , there was Bord@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the indic@@ t@@ ment only comes two days after the Republi@@ can presidency , when he said a human being in North Carolina said that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment people &quot; - Sch@@ uss@@ w@@ aff@@ en@@ bes@@ itzer and ceas@@ ef@@ ire to be elected , if its ri@@ val@@ ine Hill@@ ary Clinton should be elected and judge .
Tr@@ umps campaign was clear that the media would have spoken his words from the context , and that he would not be cont@@ agi@@ ous to violence .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before countries @-@ elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) will record considerable losses for the government of the SPD and CD@@ U .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this took part of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; representative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Friday ) &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the red @-@ black government Co@@ alition in the north barely ever regi@@ stering , this is not possible after the frag@@ mentation in Berlin is not possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have a good chance to return to the Res@@ ol@@ ef . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern over@@ thre@@ w the SPD &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 35.@@ 6 percent five years ago at 24 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the party under the survey was still just under the CD@@ U that could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is contro@@ versi@@ al between left and Af@@ D .
the left k@@ ä@@ me on 19 percent ( before 18.@@ 4 percent ) , Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country .
the Gre@@ ens in spite of easy losses with 6 percent ( before 8,@@ 7 per cent ) again in the Schwer@@ iner Land@@ tag .
N@@ PD and F@@ PD could not represent 3 percent in the country in each case .
at the Berlin representative of the survey , the SPD in the survey was not only 23 percent ( choice of 2011 : 28,@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent to 23,@@ 4 percent .
they are still behind the countryside with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but in front of the left with 15 percent ( previously : 7 per cent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented with 14 percent for the first time in the representative of the C@@ ups .
by 5 percent the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pir@@ ates would be missed in opposition to 2011 the One .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ mail and internet in time mag@@ ni@@ fier : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator got on the market .
the successor domin@@ ates today the world - his manufacturer lived a disaster .
the unit weigh@@ ed almost a half k@@ ilo@@ grams and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5 .
it was thick@@ er and bigger , it was therefore not well in hand .
on the contrary , it was rather kno@@ cked .
the built @-@ in memory was initially eight meg@@ abyte to reach this day for about two be@@ h with high resolution .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gig@@ abyte .
the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; came exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , in the shops - and it was the first smartphone .
for a few euros , lovers can buy the devices still on the internet , but they come somehow out of the St@@ one@@ age of the internet era .
after 20 years ago , the communic@@ ator was a sens@@ ation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had previously announced the product a few months before on the computer Trade Fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as &quot; office in the West@@ ent@@ asch@@ a format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could send a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , also by fax it was communic@@ ator .
even access to web pages was possible via HTML browsers , if also qu@@ el@@ usive .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a dig@@ al address and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be similar like a lap@@ top .
then a small keyboard and a Black @-@ white @-@ screen .
quite proud was the price : 2700 D @-@ Mark , therefore about 1400 Euro .
the average price of a smartphone in Germany was 2015 at 392 Euro .
no one could be in August 1996 , that the communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then , everything is different .
the clever tel@@ eph@@ ones are a success story , if not for Nokia .
the cell @-@ cre@@ ature of the Finn@@ s lived an un@@ preced@@ ented disaster , eventually was sold and carried out in Microsoft .
the market domin@@ ates the market today which everyone came to a lot later than Nokia .
always and everywhere online , this is today for very many people everyday life .
in 2015 there were nearly two billion smartphone user worldwide .
sold around 1.4 billion devices have been sold to Samsung and Apple for some 555 million pieces .
sales revenues generated with the devices around 400 billion euros .
this is the good ongoing business of the numerous App providers and the telecommunications company .
the smartphone in the meantime become a whole industry in the meantime .
the decisive break@@ through to the mass market was beginning in early 2007 , then announced Apple &apos;s Chief Steve Jobs on the Mac @-@ World the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he pronoun@@ ced three machines in one : a music @-@ player , a phone and an Internet @-@ communication , all by touch screen easy to use .
the winner of Apple began , even today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , which domin@@ ate the market we had to see .
it disappeared eventually , Black@@ berry has to fight .
you now have Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after his in@@ vention .
in the inc@@ ision , each German has now look on his cell phone in the day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to learn all , the smartphone also means , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Jan@@ ina atmosph@@ eric , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , in the Siemens Board , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said , &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent dis@@ ability is now considered a cur@@ se and blessing at the same time .
England has to guide the ol@@ ymp@@ ic spirit and Hea@@ throw
Hea@@ throw will not only be held in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me this was the biggest attraction of Hea@@ th@@ rows , just as back in 2012 in London , when we have a major effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benef@@ itted from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits for Str@@ at@@ ford and East End .
and that will be able to reach new opportunities for offices , and companies active in the vicinity of Hea@@ throw new possibilities .
for our local communities we will have already 10,000 new teachers , 40,@@ 000 new jobs will create new jobs and prepare the youth unemployment in the airport and an end .
as they were ahead with us in London , there will be such that the challenge of extending Hea@@ th@@ rows is too big .
I was told me that England will never be ready for the games and that we will blo@@ cking us on the world stage .
the two @-@ fl@@ er had in 2012 un@@ right and they are also wrong in Hea@@ throw .
there are always obstacles to over@@ coming , but Hea@@ throw answers to him every question .
how the Olympic Games is Hea@@ throw for many and not for individual a Infra@@ structure project .
enlargement is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in funny growth and to leave a leg@@ acy of capabilities and employment both to the airport and in whole GB .
we have been a great team in Hea@@ throw , which has implemented a £ 11 billion te@@ ures infrastructure investments in time and budget , from T5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport deals , up to T2 , which was built in the midst of two frequencies of the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investment .
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the extension of Hea@@ throw will also be one .
it is time to guide this ol@@ ymp@@ ic spirit and Hea@@ throw our future trade and create a leg@@ acy of skills and employment to be proud of England .

but Ad@@ block pro@@ claimed that it has found a new way to handle the new codes .
in a Blog@@ post he wrote the nar@@ ration of Ad@@ block Ben Williams , that &quot; this type H@@ in @-@ and @-@ H@@ er battle between the indic@@ ator open source community and the res@@ ign@@ ing has been already since the in@@ vention of advertis@@ ers in the field , and that it is possible to see Facebook soon with a new solution .
the fact that the world @-@ largest company has left social media into the struggle is a strong indic@@ ator for how many wor@@ rying us@@ ex@@ ers have become the industry .
worldwide according to a study from the last year of Pag@@ ef@@ air and Adobe around 200 million people scor@@ ching , almost four times as much 2013 .
with 1.03 billion every day active users who access Facebook via their mobile devices , makes man@@ y@@ fri@@ ction 84 percent of advertising attended Fac@@ eb@@ ooks .
the company has blo@@ cking on advertis@@ ers on Desktop PCs as mobile advertis@@ ers , no effect on fac@@ eb@@ ooks mobile app for the social network and inst@@ agram , shared a speaker with .
advertisement on Desktop PCs makes a enough large proportion of revenue from , so that the investment of such stri@@ ving as a re@@ warding appears .
on Tuesday shared Facebook with that there would be &quot; advertis@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to update the people more control over it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Facebook , that Ad@@ ditional new filters would be wor@@ rying , because they would also block content on the site which are no advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the users this does not represent a positive experience , so we are planning to utter@@ ance the problem , share a speaker from Facebook in an e @-@ mail message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad @-@ blo@@ cking resources , which is why we have instead concentrated on development tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences , to put more control over the hands of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
woman at susp@@ ected self @-@ ord on Swiss highway over@@ ride
the victim lay in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls witness to a woman in the early hours of morning on Thursday at a susp@@ ected self @-@ ord of several vehicles on a highway .
the fall of the fall is located on the A1 in the Canton V@@ aud region shortly after mid@@ night .
a woman lay down in the dark &quot; in an act of des@@ pair , &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police in the V@@ aud .
it is obvious that one of the Swiss at the age of 49 years of age that was produced by several vehicles , including a trucks that wanted to kill themselves .
it died still on site .
several riders have already been heard , but some are still not identified , said the police , which as well as every witnesses of the case to un@@ subscribe .
it became a revival process , what a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation is , shared G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter in the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve .
however it remains to be seen whether one of the driver will be shown .
was a mer@@ ging avo@@ idable ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something that the state must decide &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the past five years show that the drivers will not be held responsible .
in each of the two cases - when a person ran into the dark On@@ es on the highway - was decided that the motor@@ ist must not assume that a pedestrian middle of the night on the fre@@ eway , as it was called in the newspaper .
last year a polic@@ eman was awarded a polic@@ eman after having had a man over and killed in August 2014 a night on the A1 in the vicinity of Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year victims had gone dr@@ unk and has become un@@ employed on the road and took the court .
the judgment asked that the polic@@ eman had responded to a direct call , -- to an equ@@ alled manner , and that the presence of a man on the road a &apos; completely extraordinary and un@@ predic@@ table situation , &quot; was said the judge .
everyone who has further information on the inci@@ dent of Thursday in the vicinity of Morges , should be in the police under the number 0@@ 21 644 83 46 or 0@@ 21 644 44 44 release .
NA@@ SA climate : Venus was once liv@@ able
the Venus was probably once used according to the proj@@ ections of a new NA@@ SA climate model .
scientists at the God@@ d@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NA@@ SA have developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resem@@ bles which of climate resear@@ ches .
the model was designed to determine if the Venus used with its hot , water @-@ less surface and CO2 di@@ mm@@ ed atmosphere once er@@ d@@ similar conditions could be raised .
scientists have previously noted that the long over@@ throw of the Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
but the most recent simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , d@@ similar atmosphere could and still wi@@ sted slowly .
the model lighted even the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet was pres@@ um@@ ably more dry areas than de Earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and more rapid de@@ hydr@@ ation .
early Venus also benef@@ ited by a sun that was 30 percent Mat@@ ter .
&quot; in the GIS@@ S model simulation exp@@ elled the slow@@ est turn of Venus its meeting side of the Sun nearly two months , &quot; said GIS@@ S scientists Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produced rain that creates a thickness layer clouds , what a rain@@ screen affects the surface of a large part of the sun@@ sh@@ me shi@@ el@@ ding .
the result are average temperatures , which are some degrees cooler than that of the earth today are .
the model brought a history of Venus that resem@@ bles the evolution that was susp@@ ected before Planet@@ en@@ for@@ sch@@ ern .
although it once was probably inhabited , the Venus was susp@@ ended in the course of several years , too much heat and ul@@ tra@@ violet light exposed .
your oceans betra@@ yed and her water@@ d@@ amp@@ f was burned from ul@@ tra@@ violet light .
as its hydro@@ massage , there was still a thickness of carbon dioxide with a de@@ adly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that as we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophy@@ si@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .

in the course of summer long and much about thinking about how I could improve this team to give it more depth and bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the vision of trainers and Vice President of Hock@@ ey Oper@@ ations is perfectly matched to the organization .
he also has to have an employee right in decisions that influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are not currently fulfilled .
Sak@@ ic , the Ro@@ y on 23 May 2013 was given by him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick has informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sak@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the labour struggles for the kid@@ n@@ apping of Nord@@ se@@ e@@ öl@@ workers will be exposed , while all the dispute parties for a new conversation at the table , they said negoti@@ ators .
stri@@ kes are conducted against the oil Field of the wood Group have been spor@@ adic@@ ally performed on platforms in the North Sea , which are operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wood Group as well as the Uni@@ te and R@@ MT trade unions can confirm that we agreed to begin the move process of the current strike &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is called in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will keep some year @-@ day meetings in the next weeks , starting next year to start the problems again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trade unions said that their last strike , who is the first in over 25 years , a prot@@ est against possible wage levels of up to 30 percent .
wood Group this year has short@@ ened its ranks to its con@@ trac@@ tors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to neg@@ ative market pressur@@ es .
the rating of the company follows a 10 percentage decrease in onc@@ ology contrac@@ tor in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts with the company has the necessary space to come through the market recovery .
Shell has released for its part of thousands of people and announced plans , giving his oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as a result of his business relationship with the British power company BG Group rational .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; energy companies are under pressure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lower Ro@@ are under pressure , an economic situation which had to rely on the decision of the British in June , the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scot@@ tish Parliament member Dave Ander@@ son met at the beginning of this week with a workers &quot; leaders in order to discuss one of the largest work@@ ben@@ ds since a generation in the North Sea .
the North Sea is important for regional economy , he said .
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need a economy that works for many and not just for a few , &quot; he said in a statement .
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion euros will be expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to the average about $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Ke@@ pler Sets Rot@@ ation rate of stars in the star clu@@ sters of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Wel@@ traum@@ cope has helped us to collect the full catalogue of Rot@@ ation rates among the stars of the star .
the new data help the astronom@@ ers to understand why stars in the star clu@@ sters at different times , as well as in which context the rot@@ ational periods have at the planet .
&quot; we hope that we experience with other star clu@@ sters , to learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Luisa Reb@@ ull , a resear@@ cher at the C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s infr@@ ared Proc@@ essing and Analysis Center in Pasad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star@@ ry of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades is 445 light @-@ years from the earth .
many stars in this star clu@@ sters , which was formed approximately 125 million years ago , now the adult @-@ old .
you are working at the fast@@ est .
to top @-@ rot@@ ational rates this strip @-@ driven stars encounter large amounts of star .
because this win@@ ch travel by the mag@@ net areas of the stars , they have a bre@@ ez@@ ing effect on the stars .
when a star altern@@ ate , its rotation rate begins to slow@@ down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rot@@ ary rate of each ast@@ er@@ ation by taking the time between the show of a recogni@@ z@@ able star ch@@ eques -- how sun@@ spots -- recogni@@ zes .
the latest catalogue of Rot@@ ation rates points out that massive star s@@ lower than less massive stars .
re@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with d@@ ancer , with bigger stars s@@ lower pi@@ rou@@ ble is turning as smaller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ball@@ ast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Pl@@ ej@@ aden , we see that slow Rot@@ ors tend to be mass@@ aging to be a faster rot@@ ors to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the star clu@@ sters of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades is so close , it serves as a ide@@ alistic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the star@@ ry of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades offers a an@@ chor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar Rot@@ ation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
it is still much ahead of us what we would like to know more about how , W@@ ann and Why stars leave their rotation rates and so@@ coll@@ agen their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
re@@ ull and their colleagues have been reported in three times , detailed analysis of the most recent analysis of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades reported that will appear soon in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .

&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;

his signature under a t@@ enth @-@ year deal has been told him every year of 27 million US dollars .
until the end of the contro@@ vers@@ ts on 31 December 2017 , he will be in future as a consultant and youth coach - with full content .

Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en Xin@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Target inski are the first D@@ op@@ ing@@ falls
educ@@ ate : because of a positive op@@ et@@ asting may not start Ge@@ wi@@ ch@@ th@@ eber Adrian destinations from Poland in Rio do not start .
Rio de Jan@@ eiro - The Olympic Games 2016 will be over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official d@@ op@@ ing@@ cases .
a refres@@ hed Ath@@ ena would have gained almost a coin .
in front of the seventh competition , the first official op@@ ause of the Olympic Games have become known in Rio de Jan@@ eiro .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers in Ch@@ en Xin@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter barriers from Bulgaria and the Polish Ge@@ wi@@ ch@@ th@@ eber Adrian destinations were tested in Brazil and excluded - immediately before the start of the already critical of athle@@ tics competitions come these messages to the Un@@ zeit .
at Ch@@ en was last Sunday the di@@ ure@@ tik@@ um hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ d was proven that used as m@@ ask@@ ier@@ er resources for D@@ op@@ ing@@ subtle .
the International Sport@@ tro@@ shof CAS confirmed its exclusion of the Olympic Games in the morning of the Olympic Games .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old place had raised the fourth place in the finale over 100 m of but@@ terfly , only at 0.@@ 09 seconds the Bronze med@@ al .
on Friday Ch@@ en would have to take part in the scre@@ en@@ ings over 50 m open @-@ style .
Ch@@ en at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) opening the opening of the B @-@ sample and a hearing is requested .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; national trade agreements take the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very seriously and requires full cooperation among the investigations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ te &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports court CAS and will accept the verdi@@ ct . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first time in history is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CAS of the san@@ itation of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio sick@@ ed the message over the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ owa by , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went to the off@@ ensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my vi@@ ved test was positive , &quot; this is &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said to the Bulgarian TV Channel B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she is in@@ no@@ cent , &quot; the only explanation could be supplements , &quot; stated the ly@@ re @-@ letin .
according to the report , it is intended for the Forbidden substance by the blood @-@ op@@ ing@@ medium EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova has been pro@@ visional for pro@@ visional , according to B@@ NT also the B sample has already been positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ w land@@ ed immediately with criticism on the Ath@@ ena .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Bulg@@ arians under observation , so many are already excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus you may not be able to participate in the chron@@ ically @-@ loaded nation from the chron@@ ically d@@ op@@ ing@@ ent nation in Rio .
on Friday , the case was known &quot; Adrian Target , &quot; the London Olympics in class up to 85 kg was tested as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days previously positive to the an@@ abo@@ le ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on .
they both tre@@ ad the intake , both may not start in the class up to 94 kg .
in front of the start of the lightweight , especially the case Dan@@ ek@@ ova is another serious blow to the Rep@@ utation of the entire sport .
the World Association has had the entire Russian team up to an exception because of systematic D@@ op@@ ings , the f@@ usion of Kenya produced in Rio numerous poor news .
in the swimming sport , the earlier contam@@ ination had been taken in China for severe disputes between the athletes .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said this . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Dat@@ kl@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ pres@@ sen H@@ ackers her ran@@ s@@ om
programmer of black@@ mail@@ ing @-@ Mal@@ ware currently draw up @-@ to @-@ date companies and are successfully successful .
according to a recent survey by Mal@@ ware &apos;s ambi@@ ance specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany over 40 per cent of the requested firms in the past twelve months at least once , partly several victims of a attack with Er@@ pres@@ ser software .
in Germany almost 20 per cent of firms are already the target of a Ran@@ som@@ ware sub@@ press@@ ors .
40 per cent of the victims will@@ ingly prepared the perpet@@ rat@@ ors of the perpet@@ rat@@ ors of the related systems and data to be used again .
the perpet@@ rat@@ ors specialized their Er@@ pres@@ ser software according to the observ@@ ations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes to attacks in corporate networks .
they are there successfully , the potential for the compres@@ sing solv@@ ent is clearly higher than in private user .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;re currently watching a sc@@ ary quick evolution of damage software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ chef Marc@@ in Kl@@ ecz@@ yn@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 most of the Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising .
then we discovered the perpet@@ rat@@ ors software for itself .
only a private user had the target , but the change to company att@@ acking was carried out quickly in the past months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on the computer of a op@@ last@@ ly , it looks targeted to in@@ long changed files such as Word@@ - , ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as to archives images and videos .
these files encryp@@ ted the Ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als lasting .
then the software presents the demands of the pres@@ pres@@ ser .
to get the end @-@ turn@@ key code to get the files , the victims need money - mostly in the form of Cr@@ yp@@ tow@@ ing Bit@@ coin - out@@ wise .
however , where private user &apos;s personal photo database is at stake , it is available in companies around sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is still@@ ness .
accordingly , the damage falls off if a Ran@@ som@@ ware pro@@ poses .
22 percent of the German companies affected by Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to break completely under@@ break the business , in a case of people were living in life .
in Germany there were several hospitals victims of attacks , whose patients can be threatened with loss of sick@@ ness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say the victims always , it does not pay , it thereby promotes the problem of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kl@@ ecz@@ yn@@ ski &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of firms who pay their data again .
for managers it is difficult to reject the claim of perpet@@ rat@@ ors in the operation of the perpet@@ rat@@ ors of the perpet@@ rat@@ ors .
the h@@ ackers again know this and try to build a good reputation .
in a current study the safety for@@ scher of R @-@ Secure Site and contact with the press releases and come to the result : the perpet@@ rat@@ ors are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
you agree to their victims via chat how they can pay by Bit@@ coin , freely accessible support websites or dis@@ de@@ crypt example files .
and we are ret@@ ail@@ ed after payments of a few hundreds of hundreds , businesses have to do so hard and pay for five @-@ digit su@@ ms to get their data un@@ encryp@@ ted .
given the potentially high and relatively short @-@ less gains from the Ran@@ som@@ ware Det@@ ection , the h@@ ackers are always professional and share the work , the security rac@@ ented Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from Anti@@ virus @-@ providers Sop@@ hos : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware at about within a week . &quot;
prob@@ able it is however that it is three or four persons .
the programmers sell their contam@@ ination software then in the form of a software construction to the actual Er@@ press .
the previous Mal@@ ware @-@ kits emerged by the Mal@@ ware itself , advice and additional tools for a unique , firm price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; included is a adaptation tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and brand@@ ing can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the pres@@ press are then looking for further h@@ ackers to spread the fresh software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
so one log@@ s in one of the forums in the underground ch@@ asm , purchases the set of a cri@@ min@@ als and comp@@ artment a further way to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
the payment is carried out per in@@ fied calcul@@ ator .
&quot; usually bear the cri@@ min@@ als then sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread &quot; , explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that make their data better secure .
over 50 percent of firms @-@ IT leaders in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey trust in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey to be able to retri@@ eve Ran@@ som@@ ware using file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly the perpet@@ rat@@ ors of already new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the encryption of data alone is not sufficient threat to successful encour@@ agement , but the perpet@@ rat@@ ors instead of the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or prize @-@ line , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ Chief Marc@@ in Kl@@ ecz@@ yn@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the potential for damage , depending on the type of data still a lot higher than before .
the perpet@@ rat@@ ors will continue to take completely new objectives on the internet of things .
at the Hack@@ er@@ Conference Def@@ con demonstrated security for@@ scher , as they could get a with the Internet connected thermo@@ stat under their control .
in the middle of winter , the activation of a der@@ type blo@@ cking heating so @-@ aligned victims should be quite a ran@@ s@@ om .
if the perpet@@ rat@@ ors then of the heating of the future will block all the manufacturing road in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a topic in the industry 4.0 .

this is less mag@@ ically , when it sounds : the sitting areas of the back@@ seat can be made available like Kin@@ os@@ essel and thus offer storage space , which is high up to blank@@ ets 1,@@ 24 m high .
the boot room is well animated , however , the loading space with 650 mm is a slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot of the 2008 .
the shared 1,6 @-@ l @-@ diesel oil with 88 kW / 120 HP speeds up to the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm , wide range of torque very powerful .
he is likely to set up his work a little qui@@ eter .

there is still another motorcycles : a 1,5 @-@ l @-@ gas@@ oline with 96 kW / 130 HP .
a All@@ rad@@ eb is not offered .
the ch@@ atting is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
the ste@@ ering is likely to be a bit of direct .
the equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the top @-@ variant &quot; Executive &quot; no wishes .

the full conn@@ ectivity is available only for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch screen , Nav@@ i , App @-@ integration and more .
two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI socket are among the arm@@ rest and therefore are something aw@@ k@@ ward .
the approximately 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
who do not want to invest as much , receives the gas@@ oline from 20@@ 000 Euro , the diesel from 2@@ 3000 Euro .

airline is not liable : over@@ throw on air bridges
an airline is not liable for the over@@ throw of a passenger on the flight .
because an liability is only concei@@ vable only in danger , the typical of the air transport are , argum@@ ent@@ ated the Ober@@ land Court Düsseldorf ( A@@ Z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the bat had broken up with the over@@ throw a knee br@@ ace .
however , the accident would however happen anywhere - it is a general risk of life , so the judgment .
the airline had to pay no bow@@ ler to the man .
health care : when paid the operator
dise@@ ased vac@@ ation@@ ers after their journey only then money back if the cause of the disease can be found @-@ free in the hotel .
but that is only the case if more than ten per cent of the guests will show the same symptoms .
in the case the family was a family on the second day of their tur@@ quoise man hard to di@@ arr@@ he@@ a and to break down .
it spent almost the whole holiday in the room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their disease led the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a def@@ ective frac@@ ture that pur@@ ged to so@@ iled the sea water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the family was the view , the journey was so bad - and compl@@ ained against the organis@@ er .
in front of court the cl@@ amps had no success .
indeed , the cl@@ ause was def@@ ective .
but the operator did not come shortly before departure of the cl@@ ut@@ or of it .
he had to go by then that the se@@ a@@ water was fine .
he therefore did not hurt his information so the judgment .
especially since they were not found in the samples of water no pollution .
the disease of several hotel guests - which may be part of the one with each other - belong@@ ed to the general li@@ risks of life .
of our guests were only 38 erk@@ ist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Ma@@ al@@ ère , according to the people of refugees in Würzburg and An@@ s@@ bach in July , many people had to worry about further attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;

better traffic flow on the motorway
it was regularly on the road @-@ road - here a picture from November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this should change : the legal ab@@ sorb is to be extended . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is good news for all car , drivers who stand in the professional transport on the ambient road each evening in the St@@ au , when they drive over the highway and fe@@ eder ( A 43 ) .
the provincial road construction is extended by the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the hammer and the exit of Wes@@ eler Straße around 700 meters .
drivers can then go right from the hammer on the right .
the big advantage : the traffic is served early on which the total of the entire process is improved on the multi@@ purpose section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the prolong@@ ed exit had the CD@@ U fac@@ tion in the district and representation of Münster @-@ West .
the ch@@ assis on the fe@@ eder nervous the drivers above all between 17 and 7 pm .
week@@ days from the back to the bridge over the al@@ bers@@ lo@@ her path and sometimes beyond .
the reason is the needle ring on the B 51 shortly before the departure Wes@@ el Street .
from here the traffic will only be applied to the motorway A next motorway .
the second track had to be re@@ constructed before a well @-@ three quarter .
the reason : static and calculations , that the bridge has no longer own@@ s the necessary carrying capacity to ab@@ sorb all the heavy duty transport .
how long of these bott@@ len@@ pass and the associated deal cou@@ pon is not said , the permanent state is not to say .
however , the bridge has to be expected by years : for the bridge has an official resi@@ dual time up to 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal ab@@ sorb time , the provincial operation has been deliber@@ ately sought the transportation of the most vulnerable time in the school holidays because with disabilities to be reck@@ on .
the traffic will be passed on Tuesday and on Wednesday @-@ sp@@ ig at the job@@ site .

rain instead of star@@ ches : hope for we@@ ather@@ ing
the weather has made the star@@ ed Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the southwest of Germany in the night to Friday a line with the invoice - but there is still hope .
the night was not suitable for clouds and rain bad for them , the cel@@ ist spec@@ im@@ el to watch , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Fri@@ day@@ tomorrow .
our hope is on the night for Saturday .
the weather is to be good , then we certainly see many star@@ ches in the sky .
when it is pers@@ ei@@ ve , which are associated with 216@@ 000 kilometers per hour to the fast@@ est star semi @-@ doll@@ s .

relaxing night : tips against sleep disorders
in the evening you are ever eternal , at night you can wake up close to sleep , in the morning is already far ahead of the W@@ eck@@ er@@ kl@@ ing not to think of sleep .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , you are with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute has approximately one quarter of the adults sleeping , and more than ten percent emp@@ ower their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing .
as is it with sleep problems or disorder ?
there are several forms of sle@@ eves , and there are many causes underlying them , empha@@ sized Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eks , leader of the German Society of Education and Education Medicine .
what can be land@@ locked , but it is the ins@@ om@@ never , so an input and a di@@ ep @-@ sle@@ eves .
especially the play@@ ful emp@@ ower many people as uns@@ atis@@ factory or in@@ adequate , says J@@ ens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , leader in the German households @-@ association with practice in Nieder@@ s@@ ächs@@ isches Var@@ el .
what is behind sleep ?
the causes of sle@@ eves are complex .
behind it can be organ@@ ically , mental or ver@@ itable factors , but also drugs are stuck .
not rare is the distur@@ bing expression of another disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is most common in depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that various factors cover each other .
who for example has a Band@@ ing fall , can be badly @-@ eight every two to three hours and then begins to gre@@ et over all @-@ day problems and -@@ care to gre@@ et , there is We@@ eks an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should one with sleep @-@ dysfunction in the doctor ?
anyone over a period of one month in at least three nights per week is not well sleeps , and on the day it should go to the doctor , is ob@@ li@@ que We@@ eks .
the em@@ bodi@@ ment can be quite different : one is ab@@ be@@ aten , tired , infinite , has difficulties with the attention and concentration , is slightly ad@@ able , has sh@@ ake in@@ fluctu@@ ations or physical complaints such as magne@@ ts or head@@ ache .
to prevent the sle@@ eves , it is important to find their causes .
as a treatment options , among other things , behavi@@ our@@ al code , a cog@@ ni@@ tive behavi@@ our@@ al code or even drugs - classic sle@@ eves , only in exceptional cases and most for two weeks - in@@ question .
decline in Germany hardly , Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Director of the Inter@@ disciplinary Medical Center of the Char@@ ité Univers@@ ität@@ smedi@@ zin Berlin .
that is why one should first turn in sleep problems at the be@@ di@@ atri@@ cian .
the problem may dis@@ agree with studies if the problems caused a physical cause .
who should be in the dormitory , and what happens there ?
to study in the dormitory of medical practi@@ sing , for example , in case of snor@@ ing with resp@@ ir@@ ation , during sleep , or if you do not find the cause of a di@@ as@@ le@@ ep anymore , explains Fi@@ etze .
it does not have to prepare for the study .
one should spend the day normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only please do not make lunch &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the wir@@ ing one goes to bed for a normal time .
besides the electrodes in the body you will contribute a chest strap , chest strap , and a cooler at the finger .
moreover , a camera is drawn to the ceiling .
how can suff@@ erers have to get the problems in touch ?
there are quite a lot of adju@@ sting screws where one can sleep for a better sleep .
We@@ eks counts on : regular bed@@ time and ste@@ ady times , not too long in bed , on day not sleep , not watching TV to sleep , alcohol ad@@ den and at night not at the watch - then you begin to count immediately , and that is quite and not beneficial .
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has pushed himself on Facebook to the dis@@ appoint@@ ing of the D@@ SV team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 he was picked up in Doh@@ a for the first time in Doh@@ a for the first time , and presented at the same time his first Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord .
now the former D@@ SV Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler via Facebook SCH@@ Ü@@ TZ@@ EN@@ DE have put his work together in the cri@@ tique of the Ex @-@ team .
&quot; in a country where a Olympi@@ ast@@ eger 20,000 € This mie receives and a jungle kö@@ nig 15@@ 0,000 € should no one lack of missing medals , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ ol@@ ds in the night on Friday on his Facebook page .
the conveyor system in the swimming sport is bad , the D@@ op@@ ing@@ controlled , however very good .
this means that we cannot compete with countries that do so much and do not work as accurately as the subject of intelligence or even operate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say not that the controls should be set , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said he &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wanted to start a com@@ eb@@ ack , would have to be reported D@@ ei@@ bler already nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ doping agency Germany ( N@@ ada ) .
this is how you should also keep it with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who cannot be controlled at a certain time before the World Cup / OS of independent Contro@@ ll@@ ers of the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A , may not participate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the election @-@ ham@@ lets of now operates a ice cream . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : Ban@@ de of Bag@@ gage
professional Di@@ ters at Düsseldorf Airport
civilian b@@ ows of Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police have suffered the strength of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years .
the Tat@@ el@@ f@@ ere were committed as Ban@@ de several pocket and baggage .
against 21.@@ 30 clock officials in the area of the airport Düsseldorf is a gang , which was known as the polic@@ emen from past rob@@ otic steel .
the two women and two men had made several off@@ ences since mid July this year and were targeted , work @-@ standing and particularly professional .
the specialists of the crime of crime 34 can have the di@@ v@@ ings to have entered the sp@@ ection of criminal off@@ ences to Germany , four deeds have been shown .
they had a total of more than 15,@@ 000 Euro .
old @-@ built , a couple of Linden@@ b@@ out@@ ings , inter@@ ven@@ ed with even one rest of the head @-@ dr@@ ill : the Rig@@ aer Road in Berlin @-@ Fried@@ ri@@ chs@@ ha@@ in affects the first glance , but the police counts them among the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
one passes the road from east to west , one gets along play@@ grounds , a fres@@ her kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
to the fa@@ ç@@ ade of a gray house has someone &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot;
opposite from a Lid@@ l who shall also be dem@@ ol@@ ished soon , is already built : until 2017 is here a house with high windows and 133 new properties .
article on this &quot; tr@@ endy district &quot; how the competent real estate company Fried@@ ri@@ chs@@ ha@@ in calls , will be preferred with br@@ enn@@ ating cars in recent weeks .
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile , the residents were rented , on the ground floor there are still spaces occupied and are used for events .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially the Berlin Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator H@@ enk@@ el had spoken of the police against the project since the beginning of the year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ Go @-@ zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after June 22nd , the spaces were on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police force , pat@@ ented the police three weeks of official statements made by 30 to 40 officials and three teams on site , sp@@ err@@ ed parts of the street and held visitors to enter the house with the number 94 .
currency of the fourth construction workers on behalf of the unknown hou@@ se@@ owner the spaces .
on July 13 , the Berlin Board was decided that the clearance was illegal , and one day later the police and construction workers under the che@@ ers of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
at this summer morning , the road peaceful : parents go walking together with children , people sit on the may@@ or in front of houses in the sun , others enter@@ t@@ ained pre@@ y Sp@@ ät@@ i .
in the immediate vicinity of the host projects are a fundamental school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
left force is not the main care of many inhabitants : k@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer who lives since 1999 in the Kie@@ z , and J@@ ana * who are here three children , mainly of the police representative .
with the residents of the households , they share the concern before rising dr@@ um@@ pets and G@@ entri@@ fication .
it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , the majority of police guard against v@@ and@@ ali@@ zing Left .
the dit@@ ch , which of the Berlin Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator and the police between households and their neighbours , does not appear .
Fried@@ ri@@ chs@@ ha@@ in in the east of Berlin@@ s was actually a traditional workers &quot; district , which also comes in comparison to the rest of the city a lower average income and a high ar@@ cour@@ aging .
also households and the resulting housing for long have been a long time to the Kie@@ z : 1990 , numerous houses in the former G@@ DR were occupied , including almost the entire main@@ zer street all close to the Rig@@ aer .
while the main@@ zer under a large police station was vac@@ ated in a regular street race , many of the projects have been leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ aer and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied it before 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district of the district in recent years has become increasingly the magne@@ ts for tourists and elect@@ oral liner from all over the world : with them now they share with G@@ DR @-@ times and former households .
this also makes some remarkable , who has grown up for almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ aer are attacked than symbols for this development : one can recognize them in sc@@ ented sli@@ ces , or fres@@ hly b@@ aked ven@@ eers available with color be@@ ut@@ ches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other road was mentioned this year as often as mentioned in words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lef@@ tism &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason why not all neighbours can be seen as a problem that they are not necessarily affected by cri@@ min@@ ality : off@@ ences such as bodi@@ ment , according to almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
most of the off@@ ences make Sach@@ sen@@ ces , the ten@@ den@@ cial rather the new builds and fresh renovated houses meet .
for K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rental house next to the contro@@ versi@@ al 94 , there may be no talk of uncertainty .
what does not see , it is sh@@ ell@@ ently : the people in the 94 are their neighbours that certainly not have been .
even the famous br@@ enn@@ ful cars have been able to give it directly in the Rig@@ aer longer .
for the studied architect , her street is not a cri@@ min@@ ant on the contrary , &quot; here one helps to each other , lives together on the street and gets more each other with , than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has moved into the Rig@@ ing street - and remained .
that &apos;s why it was also so important that the inhabitants get back their road : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly appeared the interpretation of the district .
but in the eyes of residents like new@@ bor@@ ns , the road will continue to be taken away : through s@@ ighted new builds in former building that push the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are not only interesting rewards that are not interesting for many here - here are more people living people who are not so good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction can I absolutely not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should you do when someone else listen to anyone ?
so on all sides fru@@ stration , also in the police and the residents .
for Zu@@ ge@@ zo@@ genic that is about color @-@ bom@@ bs , K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer little understanding : the home projects and the left scene was part of the stri@@ pes .
who@@ ever moves , should be aware - just like someone who is in a pub that can be poor@@ ly compl@@ ain about noise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all only with the names given by the first people were asked to not be called by their proper name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ur@@ bach : An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is new refugees
An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is the contact persons in terms of integration and organizer .
furthermore , they are social work on site .
since July An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le the refuge@@ e bill for Ur@@ bach .
the educ@@ ators in supports the team of administration by Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
it sees itself as the contact persons for all players : refugees , Arbeitsk@@ reis refuge@@ e assistance , administr@@ ations , authorities and who else is inter@@ acting .
Reg@@ ine Client from the labour market , indicates that the volunteer is more than thank@@ ful that D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the ei@@ er@@ leg@@ end wo@@ unds of milk , which primarily has a problem .
so some - less sp@@ ott@@ ing as a rather on the variety of in@@ accurate fields areas , rather than the administration wanted to write the place .
looking for a administrative professional force with a talent for languages and people , associated with a long standing experience in the field of social work , just a hur@@ ri@@ ment of wo@@ unds .
but administrative work is not its central area , means An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organization , working with local people and also behind the scenes as well as networks .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ ol@@ ds has been around for around six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent place for three years of notice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the highest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client that An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le hon@@ ors and capital actors supported . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are large and small problems , organizational , human and continuous problems .
soon , new container stand in the washing machine
a serious problem has been recognized for quite some time , apartments for connecting people who have been acknowledged .
for the processing , the municipalities are responsible .
you have to teach refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
the cost of building , rent or renovation of these accommodations must carry the commun@@ es themselves .
the responsibility changes from the land@@ locked to commun@@ e and J@@ ob@@ center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landl@@ ord wants to offer his apartment .
the search for some time has been very difficult for some time .
de fac@@ to finds the management not private apartments .
it does not work so far , be able to rely on private apartments so d@@ eu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , shared apartments must be placed , as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers will be positioned at the washing machine .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the sam@@ e@@ word , are Reg@@ ine Client and An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le .
apart from a fixed base , there are intern@@ s , training courses , training courses , A @-@ Euro @-@ jobs and ex@@ ten@@ dencies for refugees and migrants to be found or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reported Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the Bau@@ hof or help Hau@@ sm@@ ters , do non @-@ profit work - and motiv@@ ated and very neat , as An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le reports .
they hopes that the work will lead to a positive effect on a positive effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
activity do not mean only work .
the day need a solid structure , say D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop an affili@@ ation level .
so you need special offers like sport , contacts with local and especially language courses .
professional courses are r@@ ary .
so we also jump to administration and honest@@ y .
it is central that the refugees received the feeling , they be welcome in Germany and welcome .
the long duration of procedures be a problem .
they must explain the refugees that it takes time and they can make it useful for example , for example with language courses .
who sometimes get the feeling that he cannot help you work in Ur@@ bach don &apos;t work and be unn@@ ütz , which will never integrate itself .
the distinct majority is motiv@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; problems , however , client also tells honest@@ ly , &quot; people if nothing goes to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer are therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is all already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : have the two after the recent occurr@@ ences fear of radic@@ alisation , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what man@@ cher nai@@ ve might be &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; a Res@@ tr@@ isi@@ ko could not want to conclude &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; a res@@ tr@@ isi@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to be sensitive but the hel@@ pers are already .
