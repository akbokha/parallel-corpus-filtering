<seg id="3">"" "" "" "however, the two US presidential terminator can be found in the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic terms." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">The difference in the economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a principled, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump plans to keep in doubt rather small and warned that the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wool the economy to be illuminated and to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">On the other hand it would be quite different, from Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will return regulatory authorities, and he is committed to a far-reaching control sector with lower tax sets strong - for individuals and for companies.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton is saying, the state has certain tasks to fulfil, he has placed disadvantaged opportunities and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why the taxes for the rich increases, says it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the subject of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the mts will be invests to say Trump and Clinton almost wortalike.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic applicant announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are rejected by the State-shareholder-wing of republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So on Trump could therefore send the parted internal discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">Significant are the differences in energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump aims to build hydropower stations and rejuvenates the carbon dioxide in the U.S. again.</seg>

<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">However, not only in infrastructure - even at international trade agreements, the two competitor are not too far away from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpaziective Trade agreement, both do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "at the same time, both the US want to isolate the US but simply to protect American jobs." ""</seg>

<seg id="26">The current minimum order of 7,25 US dollars is a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants it to increase them at 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump will do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum order must be rity, then he says, he should not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">However, the major discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "on the one hand, Trump is that the economy and the citizens seeks to boost growth." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics hold him before, so that the budget deficit would be even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton is asking at least one of the rich, that they pay more taxes, and their critics are saying, more taxes are also not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: a "Alliance of foreign workers"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture which ended up a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give the hands and to proclaim an official end of the eight months of the words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin receives its Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of St. Petersen Palastes in reception, I cannot multiply that Ankara does not want to reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the attack, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile can become effective, and he radiant hardly anything from, even for his reputable conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan on the other hand spoke of his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report whole five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I could no longer count.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said likewise, that relations with Russia cannot only be returning to their old level before the crisis, but even further improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day described a newspaper that Erdogan has heard that Erdogan so that would never happen some worst.</seg>
<seg id="11">I seemed to indicate his enthusiasm about the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin pointed out, sustainable culation showed that the state of Russia had nothing forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis is the first, which he mentioned in his introductory mentioned: the shot of a Russian Kampfflugar on the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow in response to the time was angry-brant.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin divides and blame Ankara, Russia has fallen in the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">This even was even bigger, since it was committed by a wondering friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Vetrys will be re-building again if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">Months long led the state of controlled media a severe, unlimited attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed, as would the Turks to blame for all the fault.</seg>
<seg id="21">The serious officers were the innocence officials that the earth's own family is benefited from the illegal oil trading in the areas of Syria, which are controlled by the so called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has suffered this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was to look ahead.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting was therefore held only because Putin received from the President Erdogan the sorry that he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a sort of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the benefits of a cease-fire is clear on the hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan needs first and foremost all the friends who he can get after spending last month at a curved coup in almost his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="28">Retracted terrorist attacks against Turkey it also have failed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey - particularly the prohibition of charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia the travel insurance companies will be facilitated and chartercompanies, when the flights are being recorded again.</seg>
<seg id="33">You count on a late-seasonal storm of the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week projected the state-TV budget for fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agrarian imports can be allowed back again.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti-ulated it as follows: "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry on the West as it reaction to the tried out of power as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">Thus, the ongoing Groll come across the Schneckentempo of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the piping is to draw from the cool mood and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian leader won in Ankara with certainty that he called for the trying state-rich support for the elected government bodies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "this is a compromising for Moscow a self-fact that itself has a deeper fear of rain-changes." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit meeting in this glanzful palace at the sea allow Russia and Turkey, one, as it was once a analyst, "Alliance of foreign workers" to present themselves: two countries that will come from the West and badly treated and is now freed.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, exist between the two still great differences.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey opposing the opposing pages.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be a draw, that after almost three hours of the first, both President on the press conference was said that they were not even attained.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey formied it to answer a question about their differences, while Putin chose to emphasize it.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus that can be found in a common denominator to Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential as a perfect Disaster, as NATO-member Turkey the Russian Kampfjet - it is certainly better that the two leaders at least once again talk to one another.</seg>

<seg id="28">As Putin about the power, he realized Ivanov as one of five people who he familiar with the most familiar.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once was suppose that Ivanov after Putin's second term President of Russia could have come since a third term Putins against the constitution.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt to health and happiness that's worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenage children and child for playing no longer go outside, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time, on screens, has been too rigid in the last decade of many.</seg>
<seg id="4">At Pokemon Go, it is about getting people from the sofa and to let us be active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then on video games and last limited to smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">I then refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characters which were initially created for the video games in the 1990s (later originated, a cartoon, game cards and other spin-Offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">As many phenomena of Population, the interest in the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand start of July something.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market introduction in other countries was moved by the massive demand that overload the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Inside a few days Pokémon Go more users as Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players go out with their smartphones for out and looking for Pokémons, which will be traced with a GPS once they have found once again, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or to be captured. "</seg>
<seg id="13">One generation who played the game when she was younger, joined the Wahn, and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the U.S. the game led to a considerable rise in steps that the "average" person repaired every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, the 35.000 users have recently prosecuted that within two days of launch of the game, the number of persecuted people who are practiced every day 30 minutes by 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who of it Pokémon Go plays - it just looks the raw data to the performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public wording of campaigns to health, people want to take "to take" 30 minutes' time, "from the sofa," and "every day to be active" sticker, because many public messages to health are boring and come by people who look.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, the significance of sport can not be reviewed.</seg>
<seg id="19">Who regularly drives, reduces its opportunities to erkist cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing to Pokémon Go is that people bringing people to do something in the open, that they are fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus, three pillars of health covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine and fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people close the hunt even new friends.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are too riric playderers that have always to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone might walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should's?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps as Fitbit already used to follow our activity before, they gave us no reason to practice sports, as this game is doing.</seg>
<seg id="29">The New will lose its charm and the use will be forged with the time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, because of poker success, however, there will be more games to unite apps and virtual reality with the activites in the real world and to help many people on the hunt, active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That's what I stand under the women's Olympics in the turn, and that is more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been in the winter since 1984 at every summer Olympics, and the USA were never so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly, this team has three turally, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren, "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspiring for many young girls of other skin colour.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jüdin is and Madison Kocian, the Katholic is, abround, makes every proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has the black and hispanic feminine presence at the top of this sport art.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one was one under the female tower inside an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This is strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas was a striking at the Olympiastewinner and the Americas.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the unbelievable performance of the triple world masterin Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they had inwaited, but mayor Gymastically subroutines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday was Simone the fourth, heterosexual American, who won in an individual multi-campaign event for women gold.</seg>
<seg id="14">Teams member Aly Raisman won Silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are experiencing the tip of this sport, but so many classes in the whole country does not see.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie smote all the same way as Aly and Madison a to create it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Learn Five," because the next Olympics will have only four dnerves in the team. besides, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as trainers.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality looks so that Turns is a more expensive sport and turbine is primarily associated with their parents, which will cost of parents, travel - Beverages -, competition and hotel costs (for the coach and their tower and families). the list can be opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turnaround are in prosperous suburbs which can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, the turers will receive its overall training and that is for families a teures and long-term commitment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainers of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainers of Laurie Hernandez, have both their athletes, since they started with the turn.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to be inspired by the municipalities of countless, young girls, which are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a high-performance and easy accessible.</seg>
<seg id="23">I was founded my turnaround of 20 years ago.</seg>

<seg id="26">Turns develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determinateness for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifetime benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that bring thousands of young girls to care for the turn and that is great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destroying plates: who does actually buy soundboards?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle ages love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you share the commentors to skids him under the ponym non-leevisions agters with rust insults, this statement leads from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov is the versatile revival of sound plates, not on a boom in Millennials who want to welcome the re of physical objects, but on the Midlife-nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently purchased a record, all predicament after the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely blade.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes by amateur collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older platters retain their feelings rather for himself (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it to spend time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would follow a news report on TV, I would like to follow the camera, while I stand in the midst of a busy road in Soho, before I steering, my hands maintain and some worrying, my hands be kept and somewhat rinscription such as: "so, let us take a sealed view of it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let us take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart Sohos slowly takes place on his charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once an independent seller have been established - there are still a handful fantastic turnkey.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman probably asking the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to appreciate her age and mixtures.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I set by Sister Ray (data controller: eight young women, three men middle ages) into the Reckless Records (meaning: eight men middle ages, one woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collectors, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I guess already" "", "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I have ca. 3.000 or 4.000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These soundboards, top (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I am not sent to him at home), dress the walls of his sitting room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy plates, which he could not afford as they appeared, and again items that were sold, when he was young and bankrupt.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I bought from the late 60s, early 70ies that appeared, when I was 11 or 12 I was. things that I was probably something to young in order to buy them," says he.</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who are buying, rather introverted and will be happy to spend time, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my laster.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, believes that many customers meet, which he meets on the YouGov's Profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, it also has a new wave of people who have influenced by the meditation people who have heard about the comeback and to illustrate their old sheets.</seg>
<seg id="24">By the talks I have managed to have people around 1998 or 1999 of their collection.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who are once selling their records to buy CDs now, sell their CDs to buy their records, "says it.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to trailers of the turntables of a particular age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the emotionical significance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop like phonica to recognize that turnaround has a soothing community of paraglider.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older clients participated in the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some turntables feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw themselves to the stability of confidential sound-envelopes, of objects, the happeniters watchings.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the colt of a emptiness or possession of material possession as a kind of consolation," says WEZ.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case for me as collectors and I think there is so many people in many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal with mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "kills a staff of a plate piles." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of ICM in April uncovered that almost 50% of the people, the last month have bought a record, they have not yet heard.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey took out that 41% own turntables we never use, while 7% of those who own a record, no record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the last report I would probably look very concerned while I flourred by a stacks at Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, which is working at Sounds of the Universe (Printed: three men middle ages), has noticed a "Trophy aspect" of the Revivals.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came only recently here again and said," I had no turntables, but I would like to buy a radio head record, so that I can put them into the shelf, he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it is definitely going.</seg>
<seg id="41">More produktown, less musicous.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no turntables."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older, who only slowly come up.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fp that has dedicated to the soundboards almost a whole floor, has a blower audience, when I re-woe.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists, the photos make, Teeny and women middle ages.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed as in the above-mentioned stores - Wild Beast latest pop instead of experimental Jazz instead of experimental Jazz dron from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such a dification at the customer.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely lonely, but nagar psychic traumata are difficult to detectable when you stand beside someone 30 seconds long.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running in business for several minutes and consider the variation of the sale available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It makes more of a mannequins than a big one.</seg>
<seg id="50">It does not deserve much, so the collector of plates is not a real option, says it.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to listen to music from a computer or to another way, but the beauty of plates is... "it drives with a dread sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how I supposed to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last Halt is a business of which is said that a new generation of turntables have to be inspired: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the Any, the Jeans-Hotpants to Musters, watching a group of young teenage cameras, grouped for a moment for polish cameras, before a father and daughter are superior to buy a crosley turntables.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody sees itself in - perhaps because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to grasp it.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "turnaround."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these objects mean more money for the industry and to send some customers to the depths sohos for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money as others, also the one that is most for luxury homes such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my neighbor came, that the results of YouGov agree, let them at least in record stores in Soho, the great number of female collectors and turntables that exist in reality, turnkey and in online.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably operate hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday tomorrow with safety on foot through turnaround of the Berwick Street and the scroll by plates, while taking the starred view of an uncanny, 30-year-a false moderator plids, which is dominated by the shoulders of nothing short middle ages.</seg>

<seg id="3">Fiji erteiled a masterclass in handling, Side-Stepping, gaps, fuss and roher power to win gold - their first Olympics of all color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was scattered by the not too bad Trostprice of the Silver medal - Great Britain in this day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they smote New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The distinct defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day could be back in the finale.</seg>
<seg id="6">But independently of it fiji in this form a 15-man team were beaten.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be for GB a consolation - but it will probably not - that at least one brite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck: Fijis Cheftrainer Ben Ryan, the former leader of England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">It had a difficult path behind.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago they lost at Ryan every game at the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This action is wastly, but the progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began wonderful and left the attacks GBs from fun waste.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell on and Co. an, as would you run in driving buses. the World Series-winner went 5-0 to top, as Osea Kolinisau in the corner of the overcrowded.</seg>
<seg id="14">With even four minutes of game, Jerry Tuwai was still another attack from the right corner, which he converts.</seg>

<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou preset by further weak Tackling of the GB teams and overthrow up to line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is so, when Fiji was born to have been born 7 to play during the UK too.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB led major changes to the half-time by and closed the fijiic gap... for all four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time, until Josue Tuisova after a brilliant interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton launched a try for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game had long been going for long in favour of the South-islanders, whose fans were dropped off, flags hangers and dances on the bleachers.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame set the i-bag with another try in recent seconds.</seg>

<seg id="12">It changes a little the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>

<seg id="15">I needed money, so it had to go better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in hospital and ran on the station around - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet on a time when they said that some steps away.</seg>

<seg id="21">Stanning, which was considered captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in a use in Afghanistan, "I was this week a emotional wreck. that's maybe something extremely but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It repeater only how much of me this means, how much I and Helen and also Robin did have worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, we would have no one, therefore a massive thanks to him. he is the best coach in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I would have no better person regarding the tray or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have been lost in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The pair had a hard rhythm over which their opponents were not able to keep up with their opponents.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark had finished, had a panning and glover had a lot in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "lead in the process, lead in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It really is important to leave itself not mittear.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not working out to do something swolles.</seg>
<seg id="33">We did not want a fireworks, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race what we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a time for one year before making decisions about his future.</seg>

<seg id="2">Wherever you are also, as late it is, it is the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro are well-resistant and undeniable, a quick season between competition and endeavours.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is, when the Olympic backel itself would be a brennan stab that is like to protect from the Armbrustment to the swimmers to the son.</seg>
<seg id="5">You cannot turn the TV, a newspaper read or listen to the conversation of your neighbors in the queue, without using Simone Biles, Katie Ley and the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there are logon Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley which is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's warm with dimples, could possibly have been sent to the Prime Time, built to the Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-being-TV advertising, if he was a swimmers, Turner or even Fell would be.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fighting in the olympic trampoline um gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic Flame were not illuminated any event equal.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shadow are the sports, which are not generally recognized: air shooting, Archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always swim the chest and may have long reign.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I might make a modest arguments for my particular darling, then allow me the attention to the discrete charm of the trampolins.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampolnjumping has already been a olympic event since 2000, it was the last 16 years so pointed, that many that I had asked that there is at all a Olympiastportart.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional Igored.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the US athletes, it has never won an medal in the trampoline and until 2012 had had a athletes, which has made it until the end.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and Russians are tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian who share the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampolinjumping has a certain outdoor charme, partly because it sounds an unresolved ear for a clowance school than those for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a invent enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonous citron of his never to end-end - but also the Grazie of the turnaround and pigs, the two sports, which are essentially united.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much means as "jumping mat."</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging winner jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (rotating, witty and saltos) before they land on feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is evaluated according to the official Olympiaprogram according to execution, difficulty and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-secondary athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, are part of each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympus vector is straight.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists need to continue in their quest for gold on, faster, upwards and dron, sometimes up to the goal, sometimes back and back, upwards and down to the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They do not only use the Ziellinie or the output text, but in the television recording also another polish goal: the world or the Olympiarekords.</seg>
<seg id="28">The purposeful pursuit is nobles, even fanatic - and it is enough to stir even a spectators.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I do even while watching this games as a bit tiring.</seg>
<seg id="30">Of it offers the trampoline a reprieve.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">An exemplary movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she promed from, apparently weightless like an astronomer, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back to top.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also here is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no wolves into the distance, just the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition among the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualifications and wounds of women will take place on Friday morning, in the streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will be the end as part of a afternoon blocks to two days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia Mania they promise them a quiet, nice moment, one which is probably overlooked in general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the unit of consciousness can only be achieved through the anxiety and the objectification of Athleten - as es the male US Turner according to The Wall Street Journal recently precipher - then awaits Mr. Dooley its according to air ringing, new wrists.</seg>

<seg id="7">But in the last few months protests against the government, the country and so far turned out to be found in ever more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week stormy thousands of people on the streets and abandoned fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The response of the government was unmerciful by human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses made that policemen were killed in zig-armed protesters and reddish.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "in the run-up-all videos about the protests, which are probably off from the last or beginning of this year, show how lack of young people hit with staves, while they were forced to make a hand against a wall." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">The Chief of the UN Authority on Human Rights is now calling for a direct investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country and in the future it will even become more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous land of Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopers to fight terrorism over the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get as much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy has expanded in a considerable pace.</seg>

<seg id="18">The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations, continuing the repression of the government - the opposition in the country became restricted, whereby discrimination have been brought to silence." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent to exile or in prison, killed or put into the deserts of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you press people and they have no other options left except to protest, it breaks it out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopies.</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protesters.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from the bottom of up to the worshifts in terms of power of the government.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a spacious choice of last year the ruling party and its allies received the last headquarters of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time the tensions along the border with Eritrea; a fight for this zens, controversial line in June hundreds of life.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analytics advocates that separatists like the Oromo-liberals front or the National liberals of the Ogaden, which were more or less imposed in recent years, the turmoil shooters and arming themselves again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of age in front of the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years have been very keepards in the situation to communicate with the social media as billing smartphones are more frequently used and improved the internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, especially in protest, many people can still communicate via internet-proxies that hide where they keep up.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young composers so that they gathered themselves so too protest.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity among the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethines in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since Äons prosperied the Amharas, who come from eththopian mainly Christian highlands, in politics and economics, while they are the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and are living in flat country areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But even this is changing just.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are in doing so, under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests found in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have dominated the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which are about 6 percent of the population and those in the military, in the secret services, in trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the rest is the death of Meles.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former vine-leader, was up to his death in a non-known illness in the year 2012 17 years of Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was viewed as a tactical genius, a man who could think of corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was especially sealed in it, early signs of discontentment and special Ombudsman to edit opponents and make them unharmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime is lacking in this fundamental act," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analytics." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopian new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected for relatively secondary reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of NordEthiopian, Mr. Hailemariam from the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not have the confidence of the tigray controlled safety services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia was born such a moil in 2005, after thousands of choices protested, according to the information of analytics were seated by the government and subsequently stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following raid, many protesters have been killed, although there were less than in the past months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly over.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development of expert-lobster leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new Pendleredition, as well as for their measurable advances in fighting poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this is not the intensification of the internal misconception of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And she takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month grips protesters in gondar, a amharian city, of tigers-operated shops and the hatred against the Tigray in the social media is always more common.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analytics say that the protests and other Western associations in a peculiar position will bring.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datklau: so perfide erpressen Hackers her ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmer of blackmailing-Malware currently draw up-to-date companies and are successfully successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey by Malware's ambiance specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany over 40 per cent of the requested firms in the past twelve months at least once, partly several victims of a attack with Erpresser software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany almost 20 per cent of firms are already the target of a Ransomware subpressors.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of the victims willingly prepared the perpetrators of the perpetrators of the related systems and data to be used again.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialized their Erpresser software according to the observations of Malwarebytes to attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are there successfully, the potential for the compressing solvent is clearly higher than in private user.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we're currently watching a scary quick evolution of damage software," "" "Malwarebytes-chef Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" world "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most of the Malwareprograms were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then we discovered the perpetrators software for itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only a private user had the target, but the change to company attacking was carried out quickly in the past months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once on the computer of a oplastly, it looks targeted to inlong changed files such as Word-, excel- or database files as well as to archives images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypted the Ransomware and deletes the originals lasting.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the software presents the demands of the prespresser.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the end-turnkey code to get the files, the victims need money - mostly in the form of Cryptowing Bitcoin - outwise.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, where private user's personal photo database is at stake, it is available in companies around sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is stillness.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage falls off if a Ransomware proposes.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the German companies affected by Ransomware, 13 percent even had to break completely underbreak the business, in a case of people were living in life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany there were several hospitals victims of attacks, whose patients can be threatened with loss of sickness.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we say the victims always, it does not pay, it thereby promotes the problem of" "" "Kleczynski" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of firms who pay their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the claim of perpetrators in the operation of the perpetrators of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a current study the safety forscher of R-Secure Site and contact with the press releases and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">You agree to their victims via chat how they can pay by Bitcoin, freely accessible support websites or disdecrypt example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And we are retailed after payments of a few hundreds of hundreds, businesses have to do so hard and pay for five-digit sums to get their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potentially high and relatively short-less gains from the Ransomware Detection, the hackers are always professional and share the work, the security racented Chester Wisniewski from Antivirus-providers Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware at about within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">Probable it is however that it is three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their contamination software then in the form of a software construction to the actual Erpress.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous Malware-kits emerged by the Malware itself, advice and additional tools for a unique, firm price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"included is a adaptation tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The prespress are then looking for further hackers to spread the fresh software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one logs in one of the forums in the underground chasm, purchases the set of a criminals and compartment a further way to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is carried out per infied calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually bear the criminals then spammers with the spread", explains Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known by many companies that make their data better secure.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of firms-IT leaders in the Malwarebytes survey trust in the Malwarebytes survey to be able to retrieve Ransomware using file-back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly the perpetrators of already new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "when the encryption of data alone is not sufficient threat to successful encouragement, but the perpetrators instead of the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or prize-line," explains Malwarebytes-Chief Marcin Kleczynski. "" "</seg>
<seg id="41">This is the potential for damage, depending on the type of data still a lot higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">The perpetrators will continue to take completely new objectives on the internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the HackerConference Defcon demonstrated security forscher, as they could get a with the Internet connected thermostat under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the activation of a dertype blocking heating so-aligned victims should be quite a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then of the heating of the future will block all the manufacturing road in a factory, Ransomware could also be a topic in the industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>

<seg id="20">To prevent the sleeves, it is important to find their causes.</seg>

<seg id="22">Decline in Germany hardly, Prof. Ingo Fietze, Director of the Interdisciplinary Medical Center of the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.</seg>

<seg id="25">Who should be in the dormitory, and what happens there?</seg>
<seg id="26">To study in the dormitory of medical practising, for example, in case of snoring with respiration, during sleep, or if you do not find the cause of a diasleep anymore, explains Fietze.</seg>

<seg id="2">One passes the road from east to west, one gets along playgrounds, a fresher kindergarten and a biolades.</seg>
<seg id="3">To the façade of a gray house has someone "ugly!"</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite from a Lidl who shall also be demolished soon, is already built: until 2017 is here a house with high windows and 133 new properties.</seg>
<seg id="5">Article on this "trendy district" how the competent real estate company Friedrichshain calls, will be preferred with brennating cars in recent weeks.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile, the residents were rented, on the ground floor there are still spaces occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "" "" "especially the Berlin Innensenator Henkel had spoken of the police against the project since the beginning of the year," "" "no-Go-zone" "" "for policemen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomy." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">After June 22nd, the spaces were on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police force, patented the police three weeks of official statements made by 30 to 40 officials and three teams on site, sperred parts of the street and held visitors to enter the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Currency of the fourth construction workers on behalf of the unknown houseowner the spaces.</seg>
<seg id="10">On July 13, the Berlin Board was decided that the clearance was illegal, and one day later the police and construction workers under the cheers of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">At this summer morning, the road peaceful: parents go walking together with children, people sit on the mayor in front of houses in the sun, others entertained prey Späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the host projects are a fundamental school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left force is not the main care of many inhabitants: kerstin Neugebauer who lives since 1999 in the Kiez, and Jana * who are here three children, mainly of the police representative.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the residents of the households, they share the concern before rising drumpets and Gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a Kiez, the majority of police guard against vandalizing Left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which of the Berlin Innensenator and the police between households and their neighbours, does not appear.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlins was actually a traditional workers "district, which also comes in comparison to the rest of the city a lower average income and a high arcouraging.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also households and the resulting housing for long have been a long time to the Kiez: 1990, numerous houses in the former GDR were occupied, including almost the entire mainzer street all close to the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the mainzer under a large police station was vacated in a regular street race, many of the projects have been legalized in the Rigaer and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied it before 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district of the district in recent years has become increasingly the magnets for tourists and electoral liner from all over the world: with them now they share with GDR-times and former households.</seg>
<seg id="21">This also makes some remarkable, who has grown up for almost 60 per cent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked than symbols for this development: one can recognize them in scented slices, or freshly baked veneers available with color beutches.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other road was mentioned this year as often as mentioned in words" "" "leftism" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason why not all neighbours can be seen as a problem that they are not necessarily affected by criminality: offences such as bodiment, according to almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the offences make Sachsences, the tendencial rather the new builds and fresh renovated houses meet.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rental house next to the controversial 94, there may be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">What does not see, it is shellently: the people in the 94 are their neighbours that certainly not have been.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous brennful cars have been able to give it directly in the Rigaer longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect, her street is not a criminant on the contrary, "here one helps to each other, lives together on the street and gets more each other with, than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has moved into the Riging street - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">That's why it was also so important that the inhabitants get back their road: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all suddenly appeared the interpretation of the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents like newborns, the road will continue to be taken away: through sighted new builds in former building that push the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "these are not only interesting rewards that are not interesting for many here - here are more people living people who are not so good." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "violence and destruction can I absolutely not." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should you do when someone else listen to anyone?</seg>
<seg id="36">So on all sides frustration, also in the police and the residents.</seg>
<seg id="37">For Zugezogenic that is about color-bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer little understanding: the home projects and the left scene was part of the stripes.</seg>
<seg id="38">Whoever moves, should be aware - just like someone who is in a pub that can be poorly complain about noise.</seg>

<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact persons in terms of integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">Furthermore, they are social work on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle the refugee bill for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The educators in supports the team of administration by Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">It sees itself as the contact persons for all players: refugees, Arbeitskreis refugee assistance, administrations, authorities and who else is interacting.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine Client from the labour market, indicates that the volunteer is more than thankful that Deuschle is now there, the eierlegend wounds of milk, which primarily has a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">So some - less spotting as a rather on the variety of inaccurate fields areas, rather than the administration wanted to write the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">Looking for a administrative professional force with a talent for languages and people, associated with a long standing experience in the field of social work, just a hurriment of wounds.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not its central area, means Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organization, working with local people and also behind the scenes as well as networks.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-olds has been around for around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50-percent place for three years of notice.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was the highest time," "" "says Regine Client that Annika Deuschle honors and capital actors supported." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organizational, human and continuous problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon, new container stand in the washing machine</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem has been recognized for quite some time, apartments for connecting people who have been acknowledged.</seg>
<seg id="18">For the processing, the municipalities are responsible.</seg>
<seg id="19">You have to teach refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of building, rent or renovation of these accommodations must carry the communes themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the landlocked to commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search for some time has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto finds the management not private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">It does not work so far, be able to rely on private apartments so deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, shared apartments must be placed, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be positioned at the washing machine.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the sameword, are Regine Client and Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="30">Apart from a fixed base, there are interns, training courses, training courses, A-Euro-jobs and extendencies for refugees and migrants to be found or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reported Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the Bauhof or help Hausmters, do non-profit work - and motivated and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">They hopes that the work will lead to a positive effect on a positive effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is not a employment therapy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">Activity do not mean only work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day need a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop an affiliation level.</seg>
<seg id="38">So you need special offers like sport, contacts with local and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rary.</seg>
<seg id="40">So we also jump to administration and honesty.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees received the feeling, they be welcome in Germany and welcome.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of procedures be a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They must explain the refugees that it takes time and they can make it useful for example, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Who sometimes get the feeling that he cannot help you work in Urbach don't work and be unnütz, which will never integrate itself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The distinct majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "problems, however, client also tells honestly," people if nothing goes to "" "" the work of Deuschle and customer are therefore always to motivate others. "" "</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "this is all already a" "" "mammoth" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: have the two after the recent occurrences fear of radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "says Regine Client quite clearly," "" "what mancher naive might be" "". "a Restrisiko could not want to conclude" "". "a restrisico" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">In order to be sensitive but the helpers are already.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "they had the fear that the attacks bring them completely into disrecall." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do," says Regine customer. "" "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would love to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So main - and honorship must be held on site and in the region according to activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">They have always in the background that soon a new blows of refugees and migrants are coming to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question is clear to answer the policy.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to put them away on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we are not yet there, where we want," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, this would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes clear that the Urbacher are already paralyzing up so far as to integrate themselves up so far.</seg>
<seg id="63">This is currently around 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they are helping them are both women.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
