the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not quite friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as in German dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
but at the meeting , it is also possible to fight the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ state solution .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for many years .
Washington cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zes the continuous settlement of Israel and raises Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of thought in the peace process .
the relationship between Obama was the Iran@@ ian nuclear programme , the relationship of the two has deteri@@ or@@ ated deteri@@ or@@ ated .
in March Net@@ any@@ ahu had an invitation to the invitation of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans at the invitation of the Republi@@ can Congress , which was regarded as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not talked with Obama , a meeting had ref@@ used this with regard to the previous election in Israel .
in a call @-@ back professor , his friend were shot up
in a call today , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on belongs to a somewhat z@@ it@@ tr@@ al voice of the police that he was shot his lady and that the officials would have to come to his house .
it was important to empha@@ size that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; but still live and probably excited , and he said , the family cont@@ acted the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
inside the house found the offic@@ ers of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ls and a hand@@ written note that was done on a white block , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved . &quot; this was by the authorities in the letter , and he was ever signed .
there was no indication of it that &apos;s travelling in two on courses for the Delta State University in Cl@@ ev@@ eland , Mississippi , which was already 300 miles on the school grounds , where he was shot by the police a popular histori@@ ography , E@@ ane Schmidt , at the door at his office and killed .
Delta State University Poli@@ zi@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that University staff members have heard at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that he has made the fat@@ al not@@ ation some@@ time in the morning .
until the end of the day there was another death : l@@ amm took the life when the police picked him bo@@ ilers .
one day after the shooting at the university , the students and lec@@ tur@@ ers to hide themselves , try to hide the authorities still , to get an idea of what &apos;s motiv@@ ated .
the details published by the after@@ no@@ ons on both ends of the state , as well as what students and employee who knew him , was helped to draw an image of a talented , but possibly delicate teacher .
students said that they were fre@@ ed on his teaching .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , he did not have a history of violence or a criminal opinion .
Schmidt itself had written a written book in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; in which he mentioned his ak@@ ade@@ mis@@ te life .
both wareh@@ ouses in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose cur@@ ri@@ ver@@ no@@ sa 17 members include , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time there were some incl@@ inations to problem@@ atis@@ ing behavi@@ ours .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who &apos;s pra@@ ised , he seemed to be a bit up@@ set and nervous , &quot; as if something with him is wrong . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ hail Sy@@ kes , said that Lamb told him that he had to do at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 with stress .
he had previously asked the Delta State University in order to be asked for health reasons and said that he would be mist@@ aken your health problem .
in this year he set only two on @-@ courses .
the latest changes in the employment policies of the University meant that the promotion , for which he had worked as hard for him to represent no guarantee for an automatic way to an employment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said , he ign@@ or@@ se nothing from a conflict between fast and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs conception . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that can no longer be answered .
after the escape from the campus the police later found Lam@@ bs lane , when he is back in the Mississippi p@@ ans@@ as .
before he could be arrested , de@@ adly , with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pi@@ stol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents &quot; city on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , Washington County Cor@@ oner method@@ el Johnson .
his car still ran in the passage .
it was not immediately clear why Lamb to this house went , but Johnson said that she believes that he knew the people who lived there .
he grew up in the region .
he began his work at the university , which had 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12,@@ 000 inhabitants and has established Ge@@ ography and ped@@ ago@@ gik .
he was a fourth in the spring in ped@@ ago@@ gik .
one of the many years of friends b@@ bs helped him as intelligent , char@@ is@@ matic and funny .
Carla H@@ air@@ ston said , she was 15 and Lamb was 20 , when she met by common friends .
you and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her the gu@@ itar@@ game .
he was at that time the women &apos;s warm .
all girls mol@@ ten there when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson city of Brand@@ on inhabitants .
musi@@ and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
in the emergency call , I have killed my wife , but there was no judgment of a wedding .
they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick building , which is adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police told that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said , they be left for 15 years ago , but friends stayed and a daughter who was 19 years old now .
&quot; she was totally destroyed at the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en on his daughter .
you and her mother were absolutely best friends .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he did never met , but with his daughter of Ab@@ ig@@ ail , he heard that he was interested in music and bl@@ ues played .
he met Pr@@ enti@@ ss , as he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail came both for three years ago .
later they played together the one or the other gi@@ g .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , his daughter writes and s@@ ings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nur@@ se , which worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ man and sometimes entertainment Co@@ ordinator at The Jul@@ ep Room , a weak lighted bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he &apos;s represented and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 September was completed after his guitar player and m@@ outh@@ harmon@@ i@@ as@@ play ended in front of a sp@@ read@@ ed audience .
there was no evidence that something was not un@@ anim@@ ous .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were alive and jok@@ ing together .
I mean , they both had a good sense of shame .

8 Ask values , which are showing that Donald Tr@@ ump seriously is to take .
some have tried it as a flop to brand .
others have done it as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some rep@@ ublic@@ ans try , Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks to move down , it has ( yet ) not worked .
ten of the last eleven national surv@@ eys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in two @-@ digit area , and some start to say seriously what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate @-@ Mog@@ ul@@ s .
of course it is too early in the legisl@@ ature .
none ar@@ gues that Tr@@ ump will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that at that time in 2011 R@@ ick Per@@ r@@ ys was handed over to the rising Herman C@@ ain , none of them won &apos;t only win a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have strug@@ gling in a general choice .
but out@@ line groups such as J@@ eb Bus@@ hs Super PA@@ C and the conserv@@ ative Economic Group Club for Growth now recognis@@ ing Tr@@ umps to grow break@@ out and start to pl@@ unge their dollars to pl@@ unge him .
here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate @-@ mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ umps &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to 180 degrees &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump its candidate from mid June , showed a survey of the mon@@ mouth @-@ University , that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans the estate @-@ Mo@@ gu@@ l have been positive .
until the middle of July there were 40 percent .
in early August it was 52 percent .
now , six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures continue in early states .
a Fi@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa has established last week that 60 percent of rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P voters GO@@ P would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a survey of C@@ NN / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of rep@@ ublic@@ ans , they would be either &quot; thrilled &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if p@@ ump were nominated .
only two of 10 say they would be &quot; angr@@ y &quot; if he would be the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 per cent they would be &quot; thrilled &quot; v@@ s. 40 per cent , which will say the same over Tr@@ ump ) .
the next thing in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand they say 47 percent of rep@@ ublic@@ ans , that they would be &quot; un@@ happy &quot; or &quot; angr@@ y &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the Favor@@ it would be a Est@@ abl@@ á , the candidate .
a majority of rep@@ ublic@@ ans sees Tr@@ umps temper@@ ament does not see as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump will be cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed for its bom@@ bas@@ tic and pro@@ dig@@ ging statements , 52 percent of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans suff@@ ers that the real temper@@ ament for a president have , such ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is valid in the first ball@@ asts of the nation , the Federal State of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a fail bed , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 per cent that he didn &apos;t have the personality to be effective and to say almost six of 10 in@@ depen@@ dents that his temper@@ ament is not in the White House p@@ asse , so ABC / Post .
rep@@ ublic@@ s can be used to the idea .
if they set their money , hold rep@@ ubli@@ ya W@@ alls Tr@@ ump for real .
if they are asked to win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a survey of C@@ NN / OR@@ C from the past week four out of ten , that Tr@@ ump was the best bet .
this is a change since the time , as four of ten end July you put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P voters had not had the clear@@ est cryst@@ all@@ ball in the past .
at this time in the last cycle , four of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans , that R@@ ick Per@@ ry will win the nom@@ ination would be compared to only 28 % for the final candidates of Rom@@ ney .
however , it shows that a multitude of GO@@ P @-@ elect@@ orate Tr@@ umps campaign should be pl@@ au@@ str@@ ated .
even if the rep@@ ublic@@ ans had gathered around another candidates , Tr@@ ump are still nearly every one .
some experts believe that the frag@@ rant field is probably contributing to Tr@@ umps guidance , while the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump @-@ support is distributed to more than a do@@ zen of other candidates .
but a survey of the mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on race between Tr@@ ump and most of the other rep@@ ublic@@ s candidates , tr@@ ump the multi @-@ making support .
he has kno@@ cked off Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points scor@@ ing , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , prior to J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before border Paul , John Ka@@ himself and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ on @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate , which suggests him ?
Ben Car@@ son would attract the entrepreneurs of 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on race .
a tight majority of Donald Tr@@ ump @-@ Fans says that they have emerged in their minds .
a new Pol@@ l of CB@@ S / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters want to support the ump that they have issued their voices .
of course , can happen much to change that , and no one can truly say the opinion .
46 per cent believed that they can be open to another candidates in order to switch to another candidates .
however , Tr@@ umps is a high competition in the moment of other out@@ ens@@ or , the neuro@@ sur@@ geon Ben Car@@ son , but voters do they have made their opinion are twice as common for Tr@@ ump .
six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump in the subject of immigration .
since then Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign was held two months ago from Mexico &quot; rap@@ iger , &quot; was the immigration and fishing point in public dis@@ course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some are worried that the bom@@ bas@@ tic expression of Tr@@ ump will be crucial by the Republi@@ can party and is def@@ aul@@ ted the re@@ oriented efforts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but after the new ABC / Post survey from Monday 6 from 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans , they agree with Tr@@ ump in questions of immigration .
so long as long as immigration in R@@ amp@@ en@@ licht , it will seem to do Donald Tr@@ ump .
the fru@@ stration has the government climb@@ ed to new high@@ s .
on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , meanwhile some of the support of rep@@ ublic@@ s , mainly by their out@@ set status .
six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new Mont@@ es@@ days of ABC / Post , they rather want a political out@@ ens@@ er than someone with Res@@ hu@@ yer .
and they are also angr@@ y to Washington .
a survey of Des Mo@@ ines register / Bloom@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks shows that three from four I@@ owa @-@ rep@@ ublic@@ ans over the rep@@ ublic@@ ans are fru@@ str@@ ated by 54 percent &quot; un@@ happy &quot; and 21 percent .

here in the Hob@@ ok@@ en@@ weg is the first urban@@ ization - with views over the Nord@@ se@@ ew@@ att .
in the street it costs a square meter of a territory of the cut 7@@ 3.@@ 300 Euro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Sy@@ lt the offer is limited to objects &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is said in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which specific cli@@ mates are a square meter most cost .
of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top towns , one of the price is like Pe@@ anu@@ ts .

&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; had promised US @-@ captain Philipp l@@ ah@@ m before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ akis @-@ St@@ adion in front of the hot@@ blo@@ ody fans - and the Münch@@ ner had stopped .
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea , without sh@@ iny .
Pi@@ re@@ aus had won his recent six @-@ games in the royal class , including against well @-@ known cl@@ ubs as Manchester United , At@@ lé@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
2011 st@@ ol@@ per@@ te here also Bor@@ ussia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
however , the Bavaria , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els were un@@ defe@@ ated with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went mu@@ d ran in her obvious efforts but often too ligh@@ tly to work .
the attacks was often directed by play@@ able to the sau@@ sau@@ ces Dou@@ glas Costa Rica that was rare against the earlier Braun@@ er Om@@ ar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had left the right more fortunate than its fl@@ ank to the right half @-@ field in the left upper leg .
in the 67@@ th minute there was the world champion the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , as the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ St@@ ür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown The Head@@ quarters of Poland covered by the line ( 26 ) .
then by multi@@ tap the go@@ al@@ Roberto with the knee ( 35@@ th ) .
although the Bavaria are used in a domin@@ ing game , I could put re@@ bel@@ lion sti@@ ff@@ ers .
he was ke@@ ep@@ ers on go@@ os@@ ter Manuel Neu@@ er , but was going .

Göt@@ ze was late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 76@@ th ) and ten minutes later everything clear , by El@@ f@@ meters there continued Müller a third .

who pre@@ diction is a higher risk to lose teeth
he doesn &apos;t understand , l@@ ends with it not only the l@@ ungs , but also the teeth - it lays an Potsdam @-@ term Lang@@ er near .
the good news : it is the risk fast .
smo@@ kers have a clearly increased risk to lose their teeth .
this goes back from a long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute of Nutri@@ tion Research ( DI@@ GI@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smoking it lay the risk to losing their teeth pre@@ matur@@ ely to lose their teeth , in order to increase the 2.5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold higher .
the scientists had observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
major contribut@@ ors for br@@ aces , c@@ aries and infl@@ amm@@ ation of the gear , stressed the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these peri@@ odon@@ ti@@ tis is smoking a risk factor , empha@@ size the authors .
the connection between smoking and dental loss is therefore due to frequent g@@ industri@@ ous pneum@@ onia during smo@@ kers .
not clear , how do smoking also increase the risk for c@@ aries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who en@@ qu@@ ire with smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time , the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the compan@@ ions resume back on the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , stated fir@@ aut@@ or Thomas Diet@@ rich from the English University of Birmingham .
people will convince people to convince , non @-@ smoking , explained special lad@@ der from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; Smo@@ king short@@ ened the life time . &quot;
non smoking is good for l@@ ungs and tubes and carries out according to our findings even to a good dental health until the high age .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population affected by 65 to 74 years of dental law@@ less@@ ness , shared the DI@@ f@@ E .
earlier studies have already had advised that smoking the risk for early br@@ und@@ ing increased .

Jer@@ em@@ y Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s Deb@@ ut near the Prime Minister of the Prime @-@ Minister
since its election Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s Deb@@ ut is expected in the frag@@ ile of the Prime Minister with voltage
the new Labour @-@ chair Jer@@ em@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n must put his de@@ but at the frag@@ ile of the Prime @-@ Minister and put himself up for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise in order to make the first of his six pre@@ determined questions briefly shortly after noon , whereby his performance is likely to be checked by the media and the Labour Members of Labour .
he called &quot; less theat@@ res and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also stated that he could ski@@ p some meetings to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the Sh@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ etts , and after his speech on the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the decision of the Labour @-@ President , on Tuesday during the Sing@@ ing of the National hy@@ m@@ ne has prov@@ oked a commem@@ oration of the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , criticism of a number of T@@ ory M@@ PS pro@@ vo@@ ned and is at the center of several front @-@ pages @-@ Stories in newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s decision , not the nation@@ hy@@ m@@ ne to sing , has attention to itself
a speaker at Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he would have &quot; in resp@@ ect@@ ful of silence &quot; and he made the &quot; Hel@@ ium of the Royal Air Force in the air @-@ eight around England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ st@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told in the BBC Two News @-@ night program , he has come to Labour @-@ chairman that the National hy@@ m@@ oms has come to sing , &quot; independent &quot; by his belief that the mon@@ archy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a do@@ zen of shadow @-@ Mini@@ ens have ref@@ used to serve to Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s extraordinary team , and they refer to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , as much as a hex@@ th of the parliamentary party .
the Political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are within the Labour &quot; base &quot; and to Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s comments on the position of the European Union and the limitation with Win .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C @-@ conference that make full changes pre@@ ference to remove the whole idea of a bo@@ unds .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ work and pensions Minister that the party is &quot; very clear &quot; be that it is only against Res@@ ol@@ ish , the limit of 26,@@ 000 £ to 23,@@ 000 £ to lower .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour @-@ chair , David Cameron , since then he has been part of the Dis@@ patch Box@@ er in the last decade .
the Labour Party , which promised another policy has promised , that he gave the &quot; crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 suggestions .
the Isl@@ ington North MP has said that the frag@@ ile of the Prime @-@ Minister is said , and that he will be under@@ min@@ ed both &quot; Pri@@ st@@ ment &quot; and the ride with resist@@ ed ho@@ oks , and turned to be serious to serious issues such as poverty , inequality and challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , which is represented by Angela Eagle , the shadow of companies being participating in him , if he is not participating - for instance , if Mr. Cameron is abroad .
he also brought the idea to talk that other colleagues can occasionally sei@@ ze the word and that he fell on John Ber@@ ry , addressed the speaker of the under@@ stor@@ ms , in order to discuss the problem .
as he became leader in 2005 he said Mr Cameron that he sp@@ ake himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le @-@ theatre &quot; which is often linked to the frag@@ ile of the Prime Minister . but some years later he sp@@ ati@@ te that he was ens@@ ved in it .
since they were sent the question in 1990 on TV , the question was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House of the House and his position under his parliamentary elections , although critics have ar@@ gues that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and should be far ri@@ pe far @-@ reaching reforms .

between May and July the result was enhanced without bonuses in the UK around 2.9 % compared with the same period of the same period .
this percentage has been the quick@@ est and stated tra@@ p on the time of an interest rate .
the po@@ sting rose by more than 1 % compared to the dollar on $ 1,@@ 55@@ 05 and had to 0,@@ 84 % compared to the Euro 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € climb@@ ed .
the FT@@ SE 100 index concluded with an increase in 24.@@ 2 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % , after the acquisition of the ri@@ vals of In@@ Be@@ v was received .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ w@@ eries of the world and brands like Bu@@ ck@@ ser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ gen@@ berry shares were extremely encouraging messages from the competition company for luxury goods Ri@@ chem@@ ont 0,9 % higher .
Ri@@ chem@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures hit all expectations and demonstrated that the turnover in China - a key market for Bur@@ gen@@ es - returns growth .

the head of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages thre@@ aten the expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter C@@ ow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean more purchase force in the po@@ ckets of the potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely , that these merch@@ ant will become the higher labour costs at his company , he says .
the cost could make the expan@@ sion@@ over of J@@ D Sports , he added , and this could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .

met@@ eh laun@@ ches National campaign to fight Al@@ di@@ - One
met@@ ering tries to protect the Ig@@ A branch in front of a Al@@ di @-@ mar@@ mar@@ sch in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ ers started to defend a Boden@@ see campaign to defend the market share of the Ig@@ A ret@@ ail@@ er in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di is prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in early next year , CB@@ M and Ig@@ A grocery stores their relationship with local food suppliers and build the brand Ig@@ A by ma@@ instre@@ am @-@ Marketing and marketing through the Social Media on , as well as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
Ig@@ A @-@ dealer and suppliers jump on board , with brands like Eis@@ manufacturers Sim@@ mo from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distributed in Ig@@ A @-@ shops who sell tickets for the South Australian football l@@ iga to tre@@ ue customers .
it is expected that metals have published further details of its defence strategy on 29 September , when the wholes@@ al@@ ers leads for food , alcohol and devices through its annual investors strategy .
there is much at stake , since South Australia and Western Australia nearly 30 percent of Met@@ cas@@ hs Ig@@ A car@@ go shops and higher profits as a met@@ res@@ hs Ig@@ A network in the Baltic States .
purchases in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ an provincial and Ig@@ A @-@ ret@@ ail@@ er include a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia in comparison to about 14 percent in the United States .
however , analy@@ sts such as Morgan Stan@@ ley that Al@@ di twelve months after opening up his first markets around five percent of the food market in these two states is dispos@@ ed and all existing players , but mostly self @-@ independent retailers .
one in this week we estimated the Analy@@ st Tom Ki@@ er@@ ath by Morgan Stan@@ ley that Ig@@ A @-@ ret@@ ail@@ er 360 $ million turnover per year and Met@@ rac 250 million will be losing the end of 2016 .
this progn@@ osis is based on the assu@@ mption that Al@@ di in the next year 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA is opened and generate sales of 500 million US $ and 600 million in each market .
the loss in the food and food shop and for the amounts on met@@ aph@@ hs high fix@@ ation could cost metals around 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , Mr Ki@@ er@@ ath .
at the same time , Met@@ cash market shares in the Baltic states , mainly to Al@@ di and CO@@ LES , although a recent survey of Ro@@ y Morgan took out that Ig@@ A purchases are the tre@@ u@@ est .
Morgan Stan@@ ley comes to that Met@@ cas@@ hs sales in food and grocery are expected by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , will fall by 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week mat@@ tered the leading Fond@@ s@@ manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , at a business meeting in Melbourne that metals will probably disappear within a decade .
metals ref@@ used to respond publicly to the comments made by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a pre @-@ profit member of Met@@ cash with Mr Dou@@ glass last week contact has received .
I@@ GA@@ s market share has decl@@ ined from 18 percent to 14 percent and income from Met@@ cas@@ hs food and food outlets , which provides about 1,@@ 200 percent , which has fallen from around 43 percent , which reflects the operating school @-@ building pressure on both sales and marg@@ ins .
however , the wholes@@ al@@ ers w@@ te@@ aches themselves and invest more than 150 million dollars in order to enhance sales of products every week with CO@@ LES and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ sen for improving their stores through faster growing fresh food and a better selection of private health foods .
Met@@ cas@@ hs main bus@@ sin@@ king Ian Mor@@ ri@@ ce says that the prize @-@ san@@ itation and store san@@ itation programs can be set to vig@@ or and hopes that the wholes@@ al@@ ers will return in four years again for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis is supported by the President of the Australian tennis ver@@ ture Steve chi
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis deserves more praise as a criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis was one of the &quot; coll@@ ater@@ al record &quot; in the short@@ est storm around his friend N@@ ick Kyr@@ gy@@ os and deserves more praise as criticism for its own behaviour .
Kok@@ kin@@ akis , the younger of talented du@@ os , which is repeatedly referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; by the in@@ trig@@ gers by the in@@ ju@@ st@@ os with St@@ an W@@ aw@@ r@@ inka at Montreal Masters in the spot@@ light .
in a fi@@ ery quali@@ fic@@ ity in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after Kok@@ kin@@ akis and his opponent Ry@@ an Har@@ rison will have to be separated with the arbit@@ r@@ ator , with Har@@ rison , saying , &quot; W@@ aw@@ r@@ inka would have to hit Kyr@@ gy@@ ms and I should hit the child . &quot;
while he recently was seen as he sm@@ ote an tennis bat , after a scr@@ ap@@ or had a potential US Open @-@ victory by Richard Gas@@ quet was def@@ ended Kok@@ kin@@ akis of chi .
the Teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with the second place in the single @-@ room behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ semi@@ fin@@ als .
&quot; one thing , about which I rather ask me is the fact that after my opinion Th@@ an@@ asi was a little in the dispute , &quot; he said y .
he lost a bat , when he lost because of a cr@@ amp in the US Open but he is not the first player , who has broken through itself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beh@@ ave in the US Open extremely well , even among the fairly pro@@ voc@@ al circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around , he has a great family around around , and I believe that he was treated as little as strictly confidential .
he is a very ri@@ pe 19 @-@ year old he works very hard , and he never fits into the team and so on , he has never himself a problem with the other players , he is good in form , he is a very stable and mature couple of young guy , and I believe it deserves to be judged for its own meri@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Heal@@ y also supported the decision to account Kyr@@ gy@@ os with the important pre@@ fabric@@ ation not to be taken on Friday , and it describes the &quot; common decision &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the right for everybody , but saves the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term fix@@ ture of part into the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we wish that the team is fully focused on the competition and not on all the contro@@ vers@@ ing around &#91; Kyr@@ g@@ os &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I believe that N@@ ick very quickly received the as@@ cent , what he has made people like fe@@ ather and Mur@@ ray . he stops talking to him . some time outside the spot@@ light , in which he can only think about it , and it is best for the team , and it is best for him .
European refuge@@ e crisis : Hungary declared Emer@@ gency to bring refugees back
Hungary declared the shelter and fron@@ ted the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and stopped all firm , which were trying to get illegal in the country . everything with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed by the border , as hundreds of migrants joined in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and Ser@@ bian officials with re@@ bel@@ lion .
people who have fled before violence , st@@ ain about an unknown time in a land@@ mark on the road between the two control points of the lands , and built tents , and settled there .
but fru@@ strations in itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a police hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter on them we@@ igh the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Op@@ ens the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and prescribed by the Hungarian polic@@ eman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some wiesen out of prot@@ est food and water back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ser@@ bi@@ ens Foreign Minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants would be returned from Hungary , while more and more of Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ater@@ al harm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there must be held in the upcoming days with Brussels and other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ences on the hung@@ arian @-@ Ser@@ b border came a day after the 28 @-@ Nations block at a str@@ itt@@ ance meeting in Brussels , no common immigration policy could be reconc@@ iled .
the ministers agreed , however , to share the responsibility for the 40,@@ 000 people who were in over@@ hau@@ led Italy and Greece . they left their hope that finally , next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would say that the EU @-@ States further 120.@@ 000 refugees , including some of Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded an extraordinary summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
however , Hungary changed his hopes on a permanent action of Brussels or from its neighbours .
the first published staff in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so they could speed up roads and asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country is planning to build a spi@@ ke wireless in its border to Romania , in order to stop the influ@@ x of migrants to the country - after it has ended up a fence at the Ser@@ b border .
CB@@ S News @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even pr@@ one can be in the race , the ech@@ el@@ wire fence between Hungary and Serbia were used .
in the last few months Hungary , Hungary for many war@@ bl@@ anks from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East became a considerable Eng@@ pass and towards the accession to the European Union .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban had however passed on that most in@@ coming economic migrants are those looking for a better life , and not war ar@@ eas@@ ed , which are entitled to protection - a view that strongly comply with other EU Coun@@ tries , including Germany .
the new laws passed on mid@@ night in Hungary in force , make the crossing the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) grave Za@@ it@@ us that led the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws lay even greater liability for condem@@ ned human beings .
&quot; due to the situation , which emerged through the mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the state of state , &quot; Govern@@ ors Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs Rep@@ or@@ tern in the southern city of Sz@@ eged .
we say it very clear : illegal border controls is a crime .

choice @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Cl@@ int@@ ons lead in Bern@@ ie S@@ anders in national survey
the former U.S. Foreign Minister Hill@@ ary Clinton receives a two @-@ digit head of the democratic race at the national level , but Senator Bern@@ ie S@@ anders wins its opposite to the soil .
Clinton has now the support of 47 percent of democratic voters at the pr@@ el@@ sel@@ ections ( 58 percent previously ) , while S@@ anders is second in second place , with 27 percent ( rise by 17 percent ) .
Vice President Joe Bi@@ ves , who still has not pro@@ claimed if he is responsible for the post office , supported by 15 percent of the democratic voters of the elections .
more than five months before the beginning of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to tell their opinion they will support .
but Cl@@ int@@ ons &apos;s suppor@@ ters are resistant to their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the CB@@ S @-@ News @-@ survey , Clinton has lost in a series of demo@@ graphic groups , while S@@ anders had a number of profits achieved .
Clinton holds a big lead in women and moder@@ ates , but this pro@@ j@@ umps have decre@@ ases .
your support in men is clearly decl@@ ined , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points .
Cl@@ int@@ on benefit in democratic s@@ men under the age of 50 have left themselves exposed , and they and S@@ anders are now on equal height .
Clinton has still a big head with the elderly .
last month the Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with two @-@ digit lead in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point advancement in this group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; about half of the democratic voters of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elections nation@@ als tell us that they would support agreement with enthusiasm if they were nominated by the party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a quarter would support it with several occurr@@ ences and another 15 percent would only support they because it is the candi@@ dat@@ as .
six percent would not support them .
maybe not surprising that Cl@@ int@@ ons current suppor@@ ters especially from it are thrilled .
the views are stronger mixed at those who actually do not support Clinton - just about a quarter it would support them .
while 48 percent of democratic voters want to say , that they Clinton to support Clinton , saying less and can say less rep@@ ublic@@ s , this over their sp@@ itz@@ enk@@ andi@@ daten Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 per cent ) .
if Cl@@ int@@ ons suppor@@ ters are asked in an open question why they want it is the most common answer that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it &apos;s time is that a woman President will ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candi@@ d@@ acy for the job ( 10 percent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; by Cl@@ int@@ ons Support will also express their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
consent to the handling of the problems and the constitu@@ encies are also quot@@ ed .
since the vice president has a potential for the post office in the horizontal section , 57 per cent of democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believe it should not do .
if democratic voters will be asked for the elections , who would be the second choice for the party is bi@@ den at the top .
of Cl@@ int@@ ons &apos;s tra@@ ilers say more than half that bi@@ ds would be far from S@@ anders .
decides to channel , not for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , the Hill@@ ary Cl@@ int@@ ons lead in front of S@@ anders , of 20 points with be@@ den in the race on 30 points without him in the race .
five @-@ five percent of democratic voters want to see Clinton as a candidate in the best opportunities to win , but this figure has decl@@ ined by 78 per the last month .
Bi@@ den is by far the second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; sel@@ f@@ ists &quot; has risen , has risen .
however , in the question of what is more important when a Candi@@ date is more important , democr@@ ati@@ le questions about the elect@@ rol@@ ment .
similarly , as in the last month he is not a single democratic candidate , or potential candidate to this voters of the pre@@ sel@@ ections than unacceptable .
the Democratic candidates and potential applic@@ ators bring good results in some important not@@ ation by the elections of their party .
maj@@ orities are looking at Clinton , S@@ anders and bi@@ ds as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy and with strong leadership qualities .
bee cuts with the three candidates most suitable for honest@@ y , while cl@@ int@@ on strength is the leadership .
thirty per cent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trusted , twice as many saying that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have their understanding of him .
democratic voters of the fores@@ sel@@ ections in general also sees Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ x@@ ide@@ ological in accordance with their views .
with all of these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters do not think of S@@ anders .
since questions about the Hill@@ ary Cl@@ int@@ on use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term as an out@@ minist@@ erial elections were satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not affected her opinions .
but it is another story in the American public .
the half of the Americans now is un@@ happy with their explanation , while only a third is satisfied .
public opinion of this was in March , shortly after the problem was come to light , split .
most Americans they said that the e @-@ mail con@@ qu@@ ently had no effects on their general opinions of Clinton , although 36 per cent believed , that their opinion of her was worse .
they are mostly s@@ rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six of ten that had to say their views of Clinton .
although the Clinton is regarded by the constitu@@ ents of their party as honest@@ ly and tru@@ st@@ worthy , this continues to see a problem for them among others . only 32 percent see them as honest@@ ly and tru@@ st@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 per cent of the elect@@ orate , they do not hold for an honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of the elect@@ orate national far also Tr@@ ump are not honest and not tru@@ st@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump will get good notes on guide .
made by the six bap@@ ti@@ zed candidate to cut bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best with honest@@ y .
a majority doesn &apos;t see S@@ anders , but as with Car@@ son , many do not have a view of him .
the error quote for the sam@@ pling of 351 Democratic constitu@@ ents at the pr@@ el@@ ect is 6 perc@@ ep@@ tions .
Ben Car@@ son Re@@ quest on land@@ es@@ next survey next behind Donald Tr@@ ump on
Ben Car@@ son is located at the latest survey of the CB@@ S News / New York Times saved behind Donald Tr@@ ump
the two Candi@@ dates back in the meantime , half of the support of voters in the new Pol@@ l , and others lose dramatic changes .
rep@@ ent@@ ester will continue to assist nation@@ alt@@ ed by a large number . the support is growing by 23 % in the last CB@@ S survey , which was conducted before the Fox News debate last month to 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but car@@ son started in the same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son plays well at demo@@ graphic groups well and cl@@ ump among rep@@ ubli@@ ators select with higher education exc@@ eeds .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Govern@@ or John Ka@@ sich was ab@@ be@@ aten by Wis@@ cons@@ ins Govern@@ or Scott Wal@@ ker who has fallen in the deep@@ est month , namely from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .

the error @-@ ge during the sam@@ pling of 376 people of Republi@@ can el@@ ectors in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest C@@ NN / OR@@ C survey , which was released last week , shows that Car@@ son is rising to the surv@@ eys - it land@@ ed at 19 % support with the rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the cl@@ ump with 32 % support .
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post showed also Tr@@ ump considerably from Car@@ son .

five members of the Br@@ other@@ hood with the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Neul@@ ing
nearly two years after a student during a layer @-@ throat ritu@@ als from a student service in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , will be ten@@ ant for five persons .
members of New York &apos;s Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Bru@@ der@@ son@@ ship T@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during a intro@@ duc@@ tory period than in September 2013 brut@@ al and ench@@ anted its transport to the hospital , which has contributed to his death , shared the police .
official said , he was lo@@ cked with a 30 @-@ Po@@ und back@@ pack full of sand and repeated , while he tried to go over a m@@ illed field on a destination .
Mr. Den@@ g compl@@ ained eventually about head@@ aches , then he fell in mind .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Br@@ other@@ hood were not the emergency number . 911 an after Den@@ g has been power@@ less and wa@@ ited an hour before they brought him into a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to altern@@ ate d@@ iner clothing to contact his symptoms and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national President of Br@@ other@@ hood to seek advice , says police offic@@ er Chris Wagner on a press conference .
&quot; at this point the members of the utensils began to hide and put the welfare of Br@@ other@@ hood on the basis of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said pol@@ ishing Wagner .
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died on his wo@@ unds in the next morning .
after an Autop@@ t @-@ seventh , Den@@ g have repeatedly tried with str@@ ump@@ ed power inj@@ uries at head , trunk and tor@@ ch .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we not only want to make the people involved parties , but if there is an organization that - officially , or in@@ officially - this has been dealt with , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner on a press conference held on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the United Kingdom College is b@@ anned the Br@@ other@@ hood , and the national fr@@ action has given its affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed will increase interest rates
a Zin@@ val@@ esc@@ ence comes , and the hou@@ se@@ ers will come into W@@ heat , Ren@@ amed for bonds , and the economy is smooth in a recession .
we know that .
what we don &apos;t know how long will all take and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy offers only small guidance for the exp@@ iry of the process .
a recession came to a recession in only 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
the ag@@ gression of the Federal Reserve when att@@ ained of interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in doing such as the economy and financial instruments .
therefore , representatives of the U.S. central bank must be emphas@@ ised that investors will not focus on when it begins to increase the interest rates but rather on the time period that is needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , market participants may find that the entire excitement because of a Zin@@ val@@ ry could possibly ex@@ agger@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is likely to be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; budget of money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Ch@@ ef@@ o@@ kon@@ om bei Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to this , we do not expect the grad@@ ual return of the US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to sei@@ ze the many , to lead the many .
however , this does not mean that there will be no effect .
here is a new era based on historical trends such as some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen in the last month , the anticip@@ ation of Zin@@ a@@ stell@@ ations can make things for a while .
once the increase occurs , the influence is not as dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is apparently a tendency that wealth offers 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may be reflected in the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank Analy@@ st in a newer study , which has happened after Zin@@ a@@ ero@@ tions of the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more accurately , the market has been in the last 35 years mostly in the up@@ wards - about 14 percent , with an average return to 500 days , with an average yield of 14.@@ 4 percent according to an actual analysis , the Bob Dol@@ l , Chief Financial &apos;s programme for Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s released .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on shares may occur later in the He@@ ighten@@ ing cycle and the return of which starts to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but Zin@@ a@@ ero@@ ations they often promote them often .
in the case the F@@ ed will face with some conditions that there was not before and can accelerate the recession .
extremely remarkable is here that the bro@@ od @-@ product was in the proximity of its lowest possible point in a Zin@@ oun of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank I had been the extent of the 118 zinc dust cover since 1950 only twice the rated GDP under 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 rose by 3.6 percent , are expected to expect this and@@ au@@ ern and expect the third quarter to the Atlanta F@@ ed only 1.5 per cent .
Zin@@ del &apos;s Zin@@ del in such a frag@@ ile economic back@@ drop could be ris@@ ky and throw the question , &quot; whether this is different from this time , &quot; says the Deutsche Bank .
market participants have established itself throughout the year on a Zin@@ oun of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week that ends on Thursday .
while many shr@@ ines and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could make an increase in this session , the Fut@@ ures @-@ Commerce will only be a prob@@ ability of 25 percent .
&quot; in our study all the boo@@ ster cycles of 1950 to date in a super cycle with increasing demand during GDP has taken place and on the rec@@ tions of Rec@@ essi@@ on@@ sh@@ ö@@ ers very quickly after the beginning of recovery in the shade , &quot; so the report is .
in contrast to this , this is clearly slow @-@ slow recovery of what the worst recession in the observed phase was .
the current cycle is far from the lon@@ gest , which has wa@@ ited the F@@ ed since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months now .
the fixed income was also vol@@ ati@@ l since the market take a Zin@@ val@@ ry , and pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect with bonds is faster than for shares when its strategic approach will change .
if bonds seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase / reduction in the cycle is done .
at the end of the boo@@ sting cycle , the bond endi@@ ces immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the str@@ aps of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates is to lead to ren@@ ew between longer and shorter bonds , closer and lead to a down@@ turn of the curve .
high @-@ consuming bonds often bring men to such climate even though &quot; we are still careful to expect higher y@@ ields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ An@@ al@@ yst@@ ine in Schw@@ ab , in a analysis .
interesting , ar@@ gu@@ ed Jones , that the markets have already adapted itself to F@@ ed strategy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of the infl@@ ation@@ alisation , there are some signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of more strict monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short term interest rates have risen , the yield of cre@@ ators is flat , cre@@ ten@@ se have increased and the vol@@ ati@@ lity has increased - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed its strategy exac@@ erb@@ ated its strategy .
in the large and whole company , businesses will cover the greater part of their business operations in the United States , benefit from interest rates and local products are more attractive .
multin@@ ational companies with high debt are worse than a rising dollar makes their products on the global market more expensive and also financing their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares have been extremely positive after a initial Zin@@ val@@ ence very positive to &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Gold@@ Be@@ es @-@ analy@@ sts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with strong balance sheet have exc@@ eeded companies with weak record according to each of the Zin@@ Can@@ ter@@ ies 1994 , 1999 and 2004 at an average around 5 per@@ missions .
companies with high capital Ren@@ di@@ ts as well as low Vol@@ ati@@ lity at their shares too met their counter@@ parts with low quality around the average of 4 ( percent@@ ages ) and 3 ( percent@@ ages ) .
debt will be a big problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates are most lose , the Gold@@ man .
outside the pure stock of stock , consumer will also benefit from rising dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ parag@@ us could see profits from higher education , even if experts are of different opinions how quickly it will take place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says parliament@@ arians Andrew B@@ ingham

BBC Radio 3 &quot; turned to &quot; Classic FM , says a leading Parliament , and increases new pressure on the radio stations , prove that he does not do something that the private sender doesn &apos;t do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conserv@@ ative elected representative Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ boss that the public @-@ legal radi@@ os@@ tic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no more be different from his commercial competi@@ tor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Radio 3 appears - I use the word &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; not like - but it seems to become Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also quot@@ ed on the BBC Music Awards , which started in the last December .
the BBC Music Awards which started last year , The Bri@@ ts seem to be just under a different name .
so , if you try to do something else - this are two spont@@ aneous examples where you actually refers only the imi@@ ing that is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC @-@ General dire@@ ktor told the pro@@ aches back and ar@@ gu@@ essed that BBC Radio 3 are far ahead of its commercial competi@@ tor , when it comes to live music and clari@@ fication .
what I learn from Radio 3 learn that I will learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music which is really un@@ matched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 , new music to find and bring new works into order , I also believe that he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey that W@@ oug@@ her worked on it to engage the audience when the British are less about classical music .
Radio 3 however , was not the only element of BBC @-@ production , while hearing the committee in the committee on the selection of culture , media and sport for this under fire , to step with the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet .

Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our stores .
we need to move it stronger into a balance .

women play a big role in making process @-@ making process .

functional of A@@ I / D@@ ob for un@@ faithful before the Court
at the National Court Klagenfurt have agreed on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian voll@@ eyball court yard A@@ I / D@@ ob for un@@ faithful and ab@@ duc@@ tor inter@@ education .
the Acc@@ used is not guil@@ ty .
one of them was also tried for am@@ t@@ sm@@ iss@@ ful .
in May he had been in force in May in May .
the current process was ple@@ aded .
according to Ober@@ sta@@ ats@@ an@@ o@@ we Robert Ri@@ ffel had expressed cryst@@ alli@@ zes , that the def@@ endants were engaged in the years 2006 to 2011 joint people , over which they are dispos@@ ed in their capabilities for private purposes .
the damage is quot@@ ed with about 40@@ 0.000 Euro .
the sports functional are also charged due to finance .
this fact , the Chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ ens@@ en@@ ate , Ri@@ chter@@ in Micha@@ ela San@@ in , aus .
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
to the acc@@ us@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defense of the un@@ faithful , the association was subj@@ ected to an asset to any point at any time .
the sports func@@ tioned could only be scre@@ ened and the sports club , for which they have been active by 1982 to 2011 and have invested a lot of time and money from the debts - the passi@@ vation comes from 2001 around 60@@ 0.000 Sch@@ illing ( rd . 44.@@ 000 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then we stood before the situation : do we proceed to the club or to go to ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the acc@@ used , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; mat@@ tered by one of the def@@ endants , in the Br@@ ot@@ un@@ f &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial intermedi@@ aries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants he decided to take this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been ref@@ used to de@@ filed our lives as security at the bank , &quot; he said in the job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have been agreed with the association : you can freely manage the money , there must be no debts .
furthermore , in having appropriate financial and success the payout of the compensation can be returned to 1991 .
therefore , one part of the transform@@ ations was only years later , namely before the year 2003 , when a plus would have been on the account .
therefore ra@@ ils also l@@ ump and not Detail@@ ed mix@@ tures , explain the former captain of the processes .
the accounts and Sp@@ arb@@ age managed the two def@@ endants together , the second def@@ endants .
why the pay@@ outs of the association was not dealt with , asked the Ri@@ chter@@ t .
the association have not interested in detail for the financial interests , not only the debt of school , so the answer .
when in 2011 against the a functioning investigation of am@@ t@@ sm@@ iss@@ ors began , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the club account .
that have been Rü@@ diger have been declared the def@@ endants .
this securities and ran out on the name of the second def@@ endants and was not known according to the association .
&quot; why ? &apos; , wanted to know the Ri@@ chter@@ in .
I didn &apos;t take a response to the respon@@ dents in a long time .
then he finally said , he believed that this is the best for the club .
when I had happened to him , nobody would have known something of this money , the cou@@ n is in the room .
the following would have been informed , justi@@ fy the function of the function .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this reference was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flo@@ p@@ ity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why damages fail ? , we wanted to know Ri@@ chter@@ t and For@@ res@@ o@@ ist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on this , the first def@@ endants did not agree with this phrase because the association never had any damage to the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what can I do if the law@@ yer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom you are all out of the Schneider . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a jud@@ gement ? &quot; , he asked .
furthermore , the working part , he never worked for an over@@ ent content , I only calcul@@ ates up od@@ ly and di@@ ets .
for di@@ ets the club has been charged to the club 1,000 Euro per month , but the actual expenditure was much higher , added , he added .
precise documents for the early years could not be the def@@ endants .
these are after an operating test , in which everything was judged properly and no longer have been preserved , made them .
od@@ ly also had the second def@@ endants .
all appointments will be made in cash , so he must drive from his place of gen@@ oci@@ de to the bank at Blei@@ burg , he explained in his statement .
the main essay will be continued on 23 September with the question@@ ing of witnesses .

time of decision on interest rates for the US @-@ cle@@ bank
the world is observed if the US @-@ cle@@ bank at two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , combined to hit the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest rates are raised or not .
a survey under 80 econom@@ ists who asked by Reu@@ ters were found out that a little more than half the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do so , now , that the F@@ ed will do some longer , and the interest rates on the current state of 0 - 0,25 per cent will keep .
it is a historical event , because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest rates on N@@ UL@@ L .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a big central bank might leave the zero @-@ area and starts a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angel U@@ bi@@ de , leading employees at Peters@@ on Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. economy is on a relatively good performance level , billions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate just a small inflation .
however , the F@@ ed can not ignore the less ros@@ ous view of global conditions .
she war@@ ned the markets to raise an increase , but the signs might suggest that opportunities for such a step are good .
the decision should be announced at 20.00 Uhr CET on Thursday

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can not play monthly
Luke Sha@@ w dis@@ ts in the Champions League defeat of Manchester at the PS@@ V fre@@ d@@ hoven , a double frac@@ ture of his right hand .
while taking the left outside def@@ enders of the wines , and close him for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al is not able to hope that Sha@@ w is again playing in this season .
the injury was caused by a rel@@ ent@@ less attack of Hé@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno during the 15th minute after the 20 years old Sha@@ w in the PS@@ V zone was in the PS@@ V zone .
he was treated nine minutes on the pitch and needed oxygen before he was brought to hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double bed structure and is in hospital . &quot;
he will be moved tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then finance to Manchester
it &apos;s hor@@ ri@@ ble - a boy , who comes with 18 to Manchester United States , it very difficult and then fantastic to play , and then takes place .
in the lo@@ cker room he had a oxygen status .
he cri@@ es .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months and it won &apos;t play in the group phase .
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy , a Red Card and the im@@ position of a El@@ f@@ meters .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbit@@ r@@ ary , has the Mexi@@ kan@@ er does not pun@@ ished .
van Ga@@ al susp@@ ected that the Italian arbit@@ r@@ ator had become extinct .
you can judge for yourself when I say , that there were a El@@ f@@ meter and one red card .
it was a very bad attack with both bands .
a Twe@@ aker on Sha@@ ws Account : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come again getting back again . &quot;
therein lies the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in the defeat of the PS@@ V
England &apos;s def@@ ender has an additional incentive to recover in France until the coming June .
Ph@@ illi@@ p C@@ oc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very severe injury . &quot;
if a player leaves this sort of injury to space , all very sad .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt a opponent .
Mor@@ eno exp@@ itt a leg , as Mexico against Van Ga@@ als Holland @-@ team joined the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear that there is a very deep injury that is not good , &quot; said C@@ oc@@ u .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball , which was in another direction , so it looked as if he &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 said Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult to be so .
I feel very bad for me . I am sorry .

surely David Cameron knows David Cameron The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents learn soon : if your child love a book , it will not take long before you know it almost by time .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems , his favorite &apos;s book was to call his favorite &apos;s book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the 1971 and of Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continued : &quot; funny , moving , creative , and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to read my children , because there seems always a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in the Cameron supp@@ os@@ edly describes the action of the book , instead , an ingre@@ dient of the film versions of 2012 returns to add the new characters and details in order to extend the fairly short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled town Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a good , a boy called T@@ ed , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of Au@@ dre@@ y , met her desire to find a real tree , whose name The@@ od@@ or Se@@ aline had died and the 1991 died , but totally unknown .
as if this is not dig@@ i@@ ously enough : the text presented by Cameron presented in part such as the summary of the Lor@@ ax Database , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy named T@@ ed , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he list@@ ened to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely , as the local environment is so little familiar . here , an un@@ official boy , as the local environment through the gel@@ sen@@ ing Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ing , su@@ preme beings , &quot; that is talking in the name of the trees , &quot; wo@@ ol@@ ated .
most probably , such a relatively low PR task was aimed at a hel@@ pers , who did not read The Lor@@ ax a 20 times in a child of a child .
a Down@@ ing Street @-@ Spre@@ cher@@ in said that the text is likely to be made by Cam@@ er@@ ons elect@@ oral office .
super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text by Cam@@ er@@ ons &apos;s employees was delivered , but were no more direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened from the exclusion from England team , but it is still difficult
to Pakistan in the United Arab Emir@@ ates , is a difficult task , but if you chose the Ka@@ der , the England for the tour , then a re@@ petition of the 3 @-@ 0 test @-@ runs not on my card .
I would not ex@@ clude an up@@ turn .
Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks page is possibly less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the batt@@ ing list , and the common spirit is strong ; they will not wear any s@@ cars from 2012 but only a y@@ outh@@ ful positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali als spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hi@@ d , even if he represents an unknown size on the test level is an option for the attack .
in this web @-@ related message : Adam Ly@@ th schei@@ d from the England Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex Hal@@ es .
the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th is of course to be analy@@ zed for me as its sur@@ name exists in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyze .
with his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that crime players are aimed at results .
there was no m@@ ages in Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , that - and I put this predic@@ ted - players are their own best as@@ parag@@ us .
after a long time ago we would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own destiny .
if he hopefully turn to Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss pra@@ ised his attitude , even if he did not have so good achievements , and this was not surprised me ; he is above all a team man .
the question how much time to get a test stroke will get to put his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - , while N@@ ick Comp@@ ton nine got .
only Comp@@ ton was given the chance to do and play .
the only way that you can rise , was that England initially set Jonathan Tr@@ ott in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in its form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
alex N@@ it comes in and it is a stroke , which I greatly over@@ lap .
he is a X @-@ factor @-@ Cri@@ t player , which we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scor@@ ed 236 against us at a Tr@@ ent Bridge square , which led us very well .
it needs to be at least the same chances as the before him , but this depends of course of the team members in the United Arab Emir@@ ates .
the idea , Mo@@ een in addition to C@@ ook draws what an extra @-@ spin @-@ Cable Housing and four pul@@ icks would be obtained , and I have nothing to do against it .
I don &apos;t see why a stroke will not see , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ l of Cri@@ cket player .
Mo@@ een might not get his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire has not been done , but is it a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my early teamwork Ju@@ stin Lang@@ er played his first 38 tests on the first drop before it began working in 2001 as op@@ ener .
he immediately managed to come and look back again .
Z@@ af@@ ar An@@ s@@ ari comes in the Ka@@ der as Back @-@ up @-@ Sp@@ inner , and in my limited treatment with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may possibly see his statistics - on average 31 with th@@ ack@@ et and 35 with the ball and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no large number of back@@ up columns who lift up their hands and the coach have decided for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the crew , England has made a few clinical ad@@ ditions of the train@@ ing@@ centre .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ ding , the Bat@@ sman from Sri Lanka , as consultant for the test of testing could be a master cou@@ p .
he is one of the nic@@ est guy of the game that will bring a wealth of experiences as it has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful way to the setup .
I always felt that he is created for international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as Coach , and as Mah@@ ela has one insights , from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh voices in the lo@@ cker room , even if the messages are in harmony with the before gest@@ ure .
Coll@@ y &apos;s teamwork with D@@ UR@@ H@@ AM , Ben Stok@@ es , is not used at One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot obtained a similar break against Australia and I for my part I have no problem with it .
some will not agree , but co@@ aches and Team@@ leaders determine not the schedule .
and you must remember that as with players depend on their jobs of the results .
such decisions will not be made easy heart .

it is difficult to determine if they will be a leg to help the Sel@@ fie British , whose energy should be used better off from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want to have because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st ten@@ dencies .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation has been a bank@@ rupt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Britain has won &apos;t a great deal of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Europeans know how r@@ äu@@ er the Fl@@ e@@ et Street can be on its cost and what an EU Sk@@ ep@@ tic has inspired the ol@@ ig@@ archy of the press coverage , as they were not inspired by Tony Ben@@ n refer@@ en@@ du@@ ms 1975 , but not our entry to 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they can be weak on Bor@@ is Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ Opport@@ uni@@ sten , who has made a name as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Sp@@ ade &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels @-@ correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with all his cra@@ zin@@ ess , Ed Mili@@ band , who were his enemies .
this included the Med@@ ley of wheel @-@ fear@@ ed sl@@ ings , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ers and the p@@ seudo @-@ candidates who own most of our major newspapers .
actually I thought Tony Bl@@ air is similar to it , but notes that if you are having a hot Gor@@ illa in a c@@ age , one gets better ban@@ anas to cover it up , instead of being at lunch and dinner .
in fact , the mili@@ band was more bub@@ bles as Bl@@ air itself , when he put himself Cam@@ er@@ ons refer@@ en@@ du@@ ms@@ vik , because Bl@@ air had rejected the principle of the EU adopted by French and Dutch el@@ ers in 2005 , which he gave him an open door .
the press has never passed it to him .

it may take , but he needs to develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sett@@ er has left on Sunday .
Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s official position on Europe is - I express it very friendly - in development .
he says that we should remain in a reform@@ ist EU .

it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; a Ben@@ n , but no Ben@@ ni@@ te &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week said that Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s appointment of the pro@@ vo@@ d@@ eller John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as sh@@ aded @-@ anz@@ ler was a bad idea .
it remin@@ ded me of the 70 @-@ er years when his old father is about to lose weight without losing its labor Kab@@ in@@ ett@@ sk@@ oll@@ on , without losing its cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s battle was more attractive .
but to fight to stay &quot; under all circumstances - B@@ enn@@ s expression - was not what about Mc@@ Donn@@ ell , nor what J@@ C did its employees and members to all reports on their position on the assembly at the same time .
whatever you want to convey the tou@@ chy bottom @-@ up @-@ image of Cor@@ by@@ n - remember that he even stir@@ red me - news @-@ discipline remains important in the era of TV around the clock and above all things in the Stru@@ del the Social Media , a bro@@ od @-@ care of Par@@ ano@@ ia and Ver@@ rat .
it is right , Cameron does not give any open map for Europe who allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for self @-@ determination as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell it said .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks safe so .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s basic attention ties to EU membership - in line with their ben@@ ni@@ te economy , its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left side , for which the Nar@@ c@@ ism of the small sub @-@ far@@ ism is a central principle of dog@@ matic dispute .

experts cri@@ ti@@ ze the report of Public Health England via e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes less harmful than smoking was created from a meeting of 12 persons , partly with connections to tobacco , saying researchers .
experts , who write in British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , locked in the British Medical Journal ( PH@@ E ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
PH@@ E published the &quot; basic report &quot; last month and describes him as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers have put the ability of data in@@ quired and paid to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
a editorial article in the medical journal by the last month of the &quot; extraordinary foundation , &quot; at the PH@@ E its most important conclusion .
two more researchers write in BM@@ J and have asked whether the statements &apos; on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor for European Public Health at the London School of hygiene and Tro@@ pical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ ewell , Professor for Clin@@ ical Epi@@ de@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the detection of the effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expects that the statement of PH@@ E that is the present best estim@@ ation that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes is about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; on a detailed review of re@@ formation and mod@@ elling .
in fact this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were called to develop a model for a multi @-@ party decision decision ( multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to lead to their views on the damage of various nic@@ otine @-@ lasting products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ ewell said that a spons@@ or of the meeting was called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose Managing Director had previously received by British American Tob@@ acco means ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also subj@@ ected the testi@@ moni@@ als of BA@@ T to Public Health in a Sustainability Report as they said .
one of the 12 participants in the meeting declared to obtain funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer but not funding they should have received before the tobacco , Philip Morris International , they added .
the reasons for selecting the members of the body are not delivered but also includes several known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes Champions , some of which also provide a branch of financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in the tobacco .
at the meeting also took the tobacco @-@ wire of PH@@ E .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trac@@ tors notes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products among most criteria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ ewell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these connections or restrictions in the PH@@ E report will be discussed .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ ewell said that &quot; there is no evidence to prove that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes is serving as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers . &quot;
prof Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Wellness at PH@@ E , said that on the statements of BM@@ J was previously re@@ acted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second lifetime smo@@ kers die at his ad@@ diction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all evidence will show that health haz@@ ards by e @-@ cigar@@ ettes compared to it is low , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
PH@@ E has the clear duty to inform the public about what proof is occupied and what does not , especially if there are so much public confusion over the relative haz@@ ards compared to tobacco .
almost 8@@ 0,000 people are dying from a disease with respect to smoking , smoking and smoking is the National Health system two billion £ per year .
due to the clear offic@@ er of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes is not without risk but only a fr@@ action of damage , which is caused by smoking , we meet our national jurisdiction .
BBC should East@@ En@@ ders up , says former chief of Channel 4
the former President of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said the BBC should stop programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows how the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broad@@ casting means should be used only to do the type of programs that cannot be sent by other UK stations .
he cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed the BBC for making it publicly @-@ legal programs that probably be seen by a smaller audience , will probably place on hard time window against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and sen@@ ders such as BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC @-@ General Vice President , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said , that he tried six years at Channel 4 without success in order to get in touch with the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes are on behalf or sends them which were clearly revealed by not sub@@ committee ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson the Ober@@ haus @-@ Communic@@ ator Committee under his research on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the Broad@@ casting fee , what I mean in medium or long term not for a good idea , you should not do his production at least on programs , others not or by order .
you send The Voice in a prime track window because they want to achieve as much wide support for their future as possible .
the idea that no one would show this is a joke , it is ri@@ dic@@ ulous , it is of course non@@ sense .
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programmes is financed , which could also be financed without subsi@@ dies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , rel@@ se out on both own productions .
honest@@ ly , others would give up other channels to their right arm .
I took me to see how this is meant to be a public @-@ legal TV .
I don &apos;t believe that this would l@@ essen the BBC ever .
Johnson , a entrepreneurs for series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 he said that the BBC blame for hunting for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to ensure long term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular programmes of the BBC give back again what the former leader of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ conference talk in Edinburgh in 2003 shows that the BBC shows how East@@ ders should sell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal framework programmes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to BB@@ C4 should not be measured , but they can ar@@ gu@@ ed their tasks , and they can ar@@ gu@@ ed when they created on their com@@ missions to justi@@ fy 4 billion £ Rund@@ funk@@ fees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they place them into a time window , in which no one you ever wanted to see .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Rund@@ funk@@ fee said Johnson the Committee , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can give the best value to this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , remember all that you get for 150 £ per year here a great value , but for those who is true for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me whether that is true , because they consu@@ me not much of the BBC .
the former Sky@@ wards and Channel 5 @-@ boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , asking for the BBC on its matur@@ ity Mission to provide information to form and maintain . &quot;
he said , only little by the BBC @-@ production would now officially classi@@ fy as education - he said that there is 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should change in the public @-@ legal television stre@@ ams in Australia and Canada .
to the issue of partnerships did El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like that of the Pro@@ ms of which he said that only a hand@@ ful of television will be shown , and with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers , in order to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics &apos; can control bra@@ id cells through sound @-@ waves

the impul@@ ses work by the switching of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , gene@@ tically modified to wear the membran@@ e channels in order to detect the membran@@ e channels .
more on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers told the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new procedure , called Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics who can be used to activate a number of brain , cardi@@ ac and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of a day could replace the depths procedure , the electric stim@@ uli in the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .

to create ul@@ tras@@ ound Nem@@ at@@ oli@@ a , changed Chal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically the wor@@ ms that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons tr@@ p @-@ 4 @-@ channel channels .
if he turns ul@@ tras@@ ound to the changed creatures , the sound @-@ waves are ampli@@ fied through the micro@@ blocks and transmitted into the wor@@ ms , where they switch the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a trail @-@ bl@@ az@@ ing tool , which allows scientists to set up ne@@ on with impul@@ ses of light and to turn off .
but Bh@@ ā@@ ani said that Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which must be sent to the desired place in the brain , the low cost @-@ irrit@@ ation can happen can be in@@ ju@@ red , and can be sent to the brain from top on the skull .

eight golden rules for the life in student houses
eleven years ago I moved out to be self @-@ held in a student dormitory , but still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ us , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile , which I angr@@ y - and to the numerous , long @-@ term complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the One @-@ train in Stud@@ enten@@ werk is enough of an easy @-@ driving @-@ pres@@ ently until absolute shi@@ fting .
it is temp@@ ting to swe@@ ating : people tell you whether you stand in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you can &apos;t love &quot; frank@@ ly , because in Ernst , guys , it is just a yeast extrac@@ ted h@@ ah@@ aha , I am in my room . &quot;
Inhal@@ e through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it acts the talk and helps you to find the people out in contrast to those with which you would not speak , even if your eyelashes would be dealt with fire and that ext@@ ingu@@ ishers would be .
leave people .
the rooms of people often turn into drinks , film @-@ night venues and municipal meeting , but they are also the places where people prefer to move and maintain their under@@ wear .
consequently , thinking : do not remember to start the Un@@ i with a relationship
In@@ tro@@ ver@@ ted receive a gro@@ be treatment at the university .
her room should be a refu@@ ge but many students live there is a space @-@ to @-@ room @-@ B@@ um@@ mel @-@ culture , which is friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
that can be hell for someone who tries to relax .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nothing will allow you to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like you , and I want to continue our friendship , but you have to go away that I get the energy back for interaction with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
try to feel exhausted when a com@@ pr@@ el@@ ial is exhausted from convi@@ vi@@ ality - and send it an SMS instead to kno@@ ck .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ pro@@ pos ank@@ le : do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a guy in my students dor@@ ms had the idea that a dre@@ amed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship with Bac@@ tri@@ ck .
since you start the Un@@ i at the peak of back Man@@ ie , the clo@@ cking of the doors of people to get along with a T@@ eller full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of 1950 @-@ er years &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood . so , and now please smile , if I ask you some personal questions . &apos;
homemade la@@ th@@ es offer is a good way to make friend@@ ships .
your fellow people feel obliged to enter@@ tain themselves and will associate at the end of maybe your face with a delicious surprise .
of course it depends on whether you are a constant B@@ aker .
poor@@ ly mixed cl@@ ump out of flour , sugar and fat , enabling people to as@@ le@@ ep for when you have ank@@ le .
ste@@ al ste@@ al is a normal crime in student homes .
of course , the cl@@ ut@@ ches of chicken is a theft , but is it the taking a drop out for your tea also ?
check this with your da@@ iry .
the chances are good that they say to serve themselves , even if they cook in the inside .
if somebody has been doing your belong@@ ings , that is anno@@ ying , and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it as my room@@ mate , who added to their milk a dishwasher to pun@@ ish di@@ ets .
it is now in prison .
you should not make noise , people from sleep or work stops at work .
it is not only about being a decent human being , but that you belong in the tru@@ est sense of the co@@ ver@@ ment to the man who are in the glass house .
a girl in my cor@@ ridor asked her neighb@@ ors whether it makes them something out that Drum &amp; bass make something qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had an examination in the morning .
she calls on it with far more lou@@ der music .
when they finally got around 5 pm , she kindly allowed her neighb@@ ors to sleep two hours before they left her own music and left her door down to their thir@@ sty test .
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would be rand@@ om@@ ed into the same student residence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the other way round , it would not be res@@ c@@ low@@ ly embarrassing when you live a room@@ mate for your future couple , sit down at them , and you will then be able to see them each day and perhaps members of how they all collabor@@ ate with their common friends ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course the heart goes its own ways - but if a name is room@@ mate definitely not your future partner in , try at least , your under@@ dog a little reason .
in the exciting moment in which you notice that somebody has found his keys in his not hi@@ red room , the border between a Ul@@ k and bul@@ lying are lying , when it seems .
a good start is funny , but it takes only moments , until he gets to the B@@ umer@@ ang .
guide you through hide a precious and am@@ using foam above security - but do never fail to anyone &apos;s room with to@@ oth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo .
close their door , and place their keys into a glass of water , which you then put into the free@@ zer - but t@@ igh@@ ten your pos@@ sessions at the blank@@ et not more than twice fixed .
irrit@@ ation for refugees , All@@ em@@ or@@ ant , Ger@@ ing@@ er@@ ear@@ ner
the Immobilien@@ contrac@@ tor Markus G@@ ild@@ ner is building a lot of money for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so , for refugees too - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living space , but also the educ@@ ating mother and the righte@@ ous mamm@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m showing how to cheap and build well today &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are pus@@ hing towards the housing market .
the entrepreneurs Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes in knowing how quickly cheaper space can be created : he builds in a project enh@@ ouses for refugees .
Mr. G@@ ild@@ ner , a lot of refugees are pus@@ hing towards the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : the mass accommodation in containers or turn@@ around has no sustainability .
for man remain in a great part here .
in the face of the refuge@@ e stream we need sufficient living in the next decades .
a quite ban@@ ker , dirty @-@ stor@@ ey @-@ house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a ri@@ b@@ age of the least room needs .
it facilit@@ ates the integration .
this is different from the people of inter@@ loc@@ s .
each of the six houses that are built straight in the pilot project , consists of three residential units for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees say there is peace , I go back .
then the houses can be easily built according to the respective needs .
how much are the costs ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : the price of 160 square meters living space per house is going on 184 000 Euro , without grounds .
this is manag@@ eable .
six months of construction takes place .
this is reasonable .
have the construction of your plans are complicated ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : legal owner I have drawn my project correctly .
especially complicated , it always makes the dro@@ h@@ ant D@@ amo@@ cle@@ us special structure and the inter@@ space order .
grey . / gr@@ us@@ y .
it is still under@@ lined who creates in a semi @-@ detached house three apartments , needs at least three places .
only in the cities is missing this place .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the residents have responded to their tire @-@ home project ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : it gave me which th@@ rowing me acc@@ used to create luxury for asylum seek@@ ers .
what is definitely not wrong .
but exac@@ erb@@ ating not the competition , for paying apartments ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : true that in the last five years we had a construction boom in Germany , but they were barely any longer afford .
my project has the message , also the normal people need living .
not only refugees but also the alone @-@ educ@@ ating mother or the righte@@ ous .
I show how to construct and well built today and well .
that is why it is about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system if Apple update will be released
the new operating system can be requested by clicking on the Sett@@ ing App , and then select &quot; software update . &quot;
when it is ready to download the phone the option to download and then install Inst@@ alling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some are according to the installation on problems , as they receive a error message that reported that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update was missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to handle the issue , users is recommended to either wait , until the rush goes back or to try to update on iTunes .
the phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the del@@ e@@ tion of apps , in order to create space - but Apple has made it easier to do this , when you delete a special tool , Apps to delete apps and then re@@ install it once the process is complete .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice Fel@@ ste@@ ausen , and invest 310@@ 000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ icity .
moreover , we are also happy to discuss Bernd Bor@@ mann , Economic Recovery in Uta Sei@@ m @-@ Sch@@ wart@@ z and As@@ endor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert .
in many places in the country we are missing physicians - As@@ endorf against it took over Dr. Frank Müller on the 1st of October the practice Fel@@ ste@@ ausen .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ icity to the retirement , her husband is Karl @-@ Heinrich his successor in the coming months still with half a spot .
after a radical change , the practice will be launched on 12 October , until then he will invest 310@@ 000 euros in the rooms at the St@@ .-@@ Marc@@ ell@@ us@@ straße 6 .
it was limited to the first glance , when the rock @-@ standing before years Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll met today , who is currently working to get their own quart@@ z bur@@ ner in the Ver@@ dener Hospital in addition to practice .
&quot; we always had in mind that the g@@ arb@@ ers would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ icity and laugh@@ s .
&quot; when I was there I simply called them . &quot;
the couple Müller went the idea to continue his own practice in the future and in As@@ endorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity and constant contact with patients are very attractive for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 39 @-@ year Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to get to know the families over the years . &quot;
as a benefit , he also see his own boss soon .
and so one got to agree , the g@@ arb@@ age bought the house with the practice .
they will remain in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there the two @-@ known family father Frank Müller also grew up , his Medi@@ t@@ inst@@ udi@@ um in Hannover follow stations in several doctor practice as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
at present he is active as a pe@@ di@@ atri@@ cian in Sul@@ ingen , in addition , he was ordered in Di@@ ep@@ holz in the district of Di@@ ep@@ holz and is engaged in the DR@@ C @-@ willingness Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from the 19th of September the practice will be prepared for the new Chief .
during the sur@@ geon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ icity , as a hom@@ e@@ ologist , his group has specialized in Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ ni@@ stin ) to the gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Mü@@ ll@@ ers , both Inter@@ ni@@ sten , want to settle into domestic .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy is therefore out of , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
after the re@@ mod@@ eling the space will be modern .
we will offer more ul@@ tras@@ ound exam@@ inations as well as long @-@ term and pay@@ load capacities .
in addition , the ED@@ V will be completely renewed .
a subsi@@ dy from a total of 500@@ 00 Euro get the g@@ arb@@ age within the context of a funding programme ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and glad we are continuing to continue the practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stres@@ ses the most important masters of Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
about 2000 patients arrive according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll every quarter into the practice Fel@@ icity , in northern Germany &apos;s office , it is about 500 .
in As@@ endorf , there is still another general practi@@ tioner .
a positive side effect of the practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in the Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
if not successor had found , they would also have gone .
who visited who g@@ arb@@ ers attended , look at the way also continues to recognise everything in confidential faces : over the seven medical professionals and cleaning the cleaning lady from the field .
with their far@@ ewell in As@@ endorf ends an era , so the medic@@ s have been practic@@ ed there for 30 years .
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; turned to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ sm@@ ausen @-@ mun@@ ic@@ nd .
a little anger , they feel after the long time already .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we still live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will surely see a lot of patients &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Inter@@ ni@@ stin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; your husband is compl@@ emented period : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always expressed my garden work , now this could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the couple has two grand@@ children and would like .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot;
&quot; well , the border controls is also high to the border , &quot; said Internal by Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner .
controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still it is clear that everyone who wants to make an asylum seek@@ er , that can also be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; natural &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the supply and safety of the people are at the for@@ eg@@ round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but clear , however , &quot; that it needs clear signals , &quot; said the Prime Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people have to know that we cannot accept limit@@ less migration flows , also not on the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Government had previously announced , Slovenia &apos;s going to leave for refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and may also allow cor@@ rid@@ ors to refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
quite so I saw the conductor of Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach but not .
the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely in@@ akzeptabel , &quot; Slovenia will rather increase the border of the border - especially towards Hungary - intensi@@ fy .
however , the limit with Croatia be heavily controlled as the upper limit of the Schengen area .
as Minister for Prime Minister , Slo@@ veni@@ ans should not be dis@@ regarded for refugees but not non@@ abrasive .
&quot; every EU member must fill his obligations , otherwise the system can not work &quot; , stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar .
as the Croatian Government , the first refugees had already tried in the nigh@@ tw@@ ave during the night , in the border flo@@ at of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ ID past to the registration of the registration .
the Croatian police could hold them in the neighboring met@@ is@@ ations .
according to local media since then , in Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik and re@@ port@@ V@@ ary is constantly re@@ present with new refugees .
it was mostly about Sy@@ rer and Af@@ gh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
even rescue services and the Red Cross already be used .
in the coming days you will be held about 4000 refugees , with the Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ ence to the Maced@@ onian border , which has so far been taken to the Hungarian border , in the direction of Croatia , reported on Croatian and Ser@@ bian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the government in Bel@@ grade advoc@@ ates that they may be able to propose certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media , there is no first bus to arrive at around 50 refugees in the Ser@@ b border town S@@ ID , in the course of the day , further buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the in@@ mates were the whole night from the around 500 kilometers distant provincial border with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has provided us , so we told the police that we should go here , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany .
in this way , it could actually be the previous shift from the former Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia to a somewhat further west @-@ located route .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot;
Croatian , the Minister of O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country had prepared for the fall of a strong state of refugees with appropriate plans for possible ex@@ po@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; details called he did not , but it pointed out that Croatia as non @-@ Schengen member , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities of the border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one run different controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
since 2007 , Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partner since has since been a good record in which the border controls has been established .
on ser@@ b@@ lical side , and behind the Hungarian border to about 300 refugees firm .
according to Bel@@ grade of media , they had spent the past night at the border crossing H@@ orgas@@ os that leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke leads .
according to information of the Hungarian authorities the two border cross@@ ings H@@ org@@ os and back@@ i Bre@@ g continue to be fully blocked .
whether the remaining refugees now want to go to the Croatian border , is still un@@ clear .
the Ser@@ bian Minister Neb@@ o@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic gave to so@@ othing the debate on an alternative life in H@@ org@@ os : he consider the debate on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed , for breakfast .
it would not currently be a high level of refugees .
you might not say whether they would continue their journey over Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers rates of migrants - dangerous - Alternative gl@@ uten
however , private Hungarian refuge@@ e shel@@ ters have already begun to sp@@ li@@ ts the refugees land@@ ing on which alternative routes are indicated throughout Croatia .
but the border cross@@ ings between Serbia and Croatia is not harm@@ less : in parts of the border @-@ area , there are still 20 years after the end of Croatia &apos;s end @-@ war , not yet vac@@ ated min@@ ef@@ ields .
in the morning there was the Croatian police known that a team of mines sp@@ ans in the border region was sent .

Fed@@ Ex @-@ Score mixed , Fin@@ anz @-@ views for 2016
Fed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appoint@@ ing results for the last quarter , and the supply of Gig@@ ant compl@@ ain its profits on a whole year because of the weak@@ est demand for freight @-@ services and higher costs in his Bod@@ sport service .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said that nevertheless , that the result compared to the previous year due to Kost@@ ens@@ enk@@ ung , higher recei@@ p@@ ts and growth for growth in the online trade . &quot; &quot; &quot;

but the boom in on @-@ line shopping has pushed the results at Fed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter the sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and security .
the Express @-@ unit directories higher recei@@ p@@ ts due to higher prices , while the result is d@@ rank because of higher labour costs in freight .
in the Pre@@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , s@@ way the Fed@@ Ex @-@ shares around 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , in 15@@ 0.15 $ .
on Tuesday she closed 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11th .
at its most anticipated meeting in the year , Federal Reserve Str@@ at@@ egen two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ Mah@@ ag@@ oni @-@ table se@@ ated to decide if it is time for the first time since almost a decade to stress the conduc@@ tivity .
risk of them at an end of the two , two @-@ stor@@ ey@@ ed sitting sa@@ ver there is a wall @-@ image of the United States .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ Chair Jan@@ et L. Y@@ elles and their colleagues set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a second order from the Congress : maxim@@ izing the US @-@ employment and prices here stable .
but since the big recession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognised that there is an un@@ preced@@ ented mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate might be the X factor in a decision that is too tight for them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to become un@@ reconc@@ iled by the close to zero @-@ term interest rate since end of 2008 .
although most of the data of the economy show that it grows solid , the recent turbul@@ ences on the global financial markets have already increasing the deliber@@ ate su@@ ed representatives to consoli@@ date these people by raising the interest rate for Federal Republic , and be it also just a quarter of percent@@ head .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation must be the most important , what they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Ch@@ ef@@ economically in the Ma@@ kl@@ er@@ le Sti@@ eg@@ et Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think when looking for a pre@@ text , the interest rate was not to increase , the increased uncertainty about the global market have to wait enough , &quot; said she . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do what will improve on yourself the financial market .
about half of econom@@ ists who have been wonder@@ ed recently from Bloom@@ berg have been a Zin@@ as@@ ber this week prior .
however , the financial markets expect a wait for the F@@ ed , with a key@@ indication , which shows only a 30 % chance for an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the shr@@ ink reach the blow , making them promise that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday j@@ ump@@ ed of the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ average worth 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or about 1.4 % on 16.@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that F@@ ed @-@ policies holds the sentence in this week , &quot; John Lon@@ ski , Ch@@ ef@@ o@@ kon@@ om bei M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would lift the phr@@ ases at this time , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she is doing it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to go very far in their explanation to calm the financial markets , so that they don &apos;t get into panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts ar@@ gu@@ ed that a Zin@@ del &apos;s financial markets would so@@ othing the financial markets because they would act the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
even before a month the fet@@ ched seemed on good ways to increase the sentence by 0,25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow fault of the mon@@ ary conditions that would test the strength of the recovery in the United States .
y@@ outh@@ ful had said in spring and in early summer they were told in this year despite the dis@@ comfort of liber@@ als that more economic advance would be necessary to increase a raise of the proposition .
although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ down , the improvement in the labour market was strongly .
the unemployment rate s@@ ank to 5,@@ 1 % last month , the lowest resistance for more than seven years and close to the level , which indicates the F@@ ed as full employment .
sl@@ y@@ ields have shown signs of a recovery .
and although the inflation took place under the annual goal of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed Repres@@ ent@@ atives were told that the main reason the temporary effect of clearly lower oil @-@ travel would be .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can overcome higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Sh@@ epher@@ d@@ son , Ch@@ ef@@ ö@@ k@@ om bei Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but financial markets around the world turn out over the end of the last month after China had valued its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ average was worth more than 16 % under its peak , as investors fear@@ ed that a slow@@ down of Chinese economy would favour a global growth .
the market has relax in this month , whereby D@@ ow now is up to almost 10 % below the yo@@ ke of May .
for the F@@ ed Repres@@ ent@@ atives influence the turbul@@ ences , the complex calculation , when to increase interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the events on the financial markets , and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in recent weeks would not appeared , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , senior Research Fel@@ low on U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former member of the U.S. bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he sa@@ ith that they will be waiting for at least one month to get the effects better .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the effects on U.S. economy will be and there is almost no reliable data which describe developments in China , &quot; says O@@ liner .
the health of the world economy is none of the su@@ ed , therefore it should not be involved in their decision @-@ making process .
but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Fund has become the world .
the influence of the central bank had been huge over the past few years .
the mere notice of the human being Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed their mon@@ ary expansion &quot; can be tor@@ n away , sol@@ u@@ ble per@@ si@@ ties around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed Repres@@ ent@@ atives can be monitored , but also with other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the global strategy for the management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , not@@ te this month that &quot; the F@@ ed a story of over@@ reactions on financial market @-@ movements are linked to the economic fund@@ ament data . &quot;
L@@ acker , un@@ author@@ ised member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which sets up for a Zin@@ val@@ ry , mentioned decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to record their guidel@@ ine around 0,75 percent@@ ages in three sessions , despite real impact on growth in the US , &quot; said L@@ acker .
a year later the F@@ ed Repres@@ ent@@ atives were reduced .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis such as the market break in 2008 , Adam S. Poz@@ nan , former member of the Committee for the interest rate of the Bank of England .
the latest tur@@ mo@@ il come not close to this level , he said .
&quot; it certainly does not want to get into the situation in which they are afraid of a Zin@@ c , because the markets differ , &quot; said Posen , President of Peters@@ on Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t believe that it should pres@@ et the time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ sh@@ ilfe for refugees
more and more refugees come to Germany for more refugees
we will welcome you with a warm welcome , not without the engagement of the volunteer volunteer .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a whole series of people who are un@@ event@@ ful asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
among them are Petra and Klaus Heine .
Petra Heine is with a body and soul teacher .
also with their 74 trucks they are still informed .
every Thursday it does it in asylum seek@@ er at the D@@ ill@@ inger Strasse .
there it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German language .
of course , the very different classes should be considered at a right school .
Brazil pa@@ edi@@ atric society Rio Grande promotes food for healthy bre@@ ast@@ feeding .
the Brazilian cop@@ di@@ atric organization SP@@ RS tried to clarify how important good food is during the bre@@ ast@@ feeding . she is doing this with the presentation of pictures of babies which are interested in fr@@ actions of un@@ healthy foods are painted .
mother &apos;s milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , the babies provide all the nutrients they require to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers get out to increase their daily calcium intake around 500 cal@@ ories per day .
however , a new research results that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only di@@ fying adaptation to the mothers .
a recent study conducted under the direction of Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ ine College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy nutrition fluctu@@ ate women really concerns the gen@@ es of their babies and it protects them from the development of tum@@ ors .
unfortunately , a un@@ healthy nutrition of the child can neg@@ atively affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ri@@ eder Sports Hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the component for the 2.3 million Euro co@@ stly Spor@@ thalle .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be used for solar installation .
the plann@@ ers for the long @-@ trained turn@@ hall@@ marks are step forward by step : in the recent church session , the completed building was performed without a large discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the body had a request on a construc@@ tional legal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; significant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the valid ben@@ ch@@ engine plan &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the &quot; exception &quot; it was permission for a special form regarding the construction .
thus , a &quot; break@@ er should be er@@ ected with no @-@ mitt@@ ent first and Dach@@ stein .
background of the planning is the launch of the roof surface for solar generators : &quot; thereby , we get a wonderful big sw@@ am together , &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting .
in the &quot; liberation , it went in turn around the roof , which is written out of energetic reasons - unlike in the construction plan - under ten degrees .
the volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the entry plan will not be allowed to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - whereby the Bern@@ ri@@ eder community is usually refined during free movement in liber@@ ating orders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , in the gym@@ n@@ ates , it is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create preced@@ ence &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gym@@ n@@ ates at the sports center is a joint project of the municipality and SV Bern@@ ried .
costs are expected around 2.3 million euros on predic@@ ted .
grant are anticipated by the school and B@@ rei@@ ten@@ sport@@ y .
the next process step will be put forward for the 18 x 36 meters big hall now present to the land@@ ing .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg is moving to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the Hospital P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg was planned to be closed before as planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is at the hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au at the same time .
the station as well as the majority of employees go from P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg by Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this is seen the un@@ believ@@ able plans of the hospital GmbH of the country , the land@@ ing in Andrea Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White .
a decision on the Supervisory Board , however , and the post@@ pon@@ ed for the next Wednesday , 23 September .
should the plans be implemented , then all of the nearly 50 employees work at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg .
the vast majority with fishermen and the far existing inside station to Sch@@ ong@@ au move .

triggered the change the dism@@ iss@@ al of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been in the beginning since the beginning of the show of the Sch@@ ong@@ au Klinik and is now moving into a private pra@@ xis near the hospital .
when the question of who came to follow the follow @-@ up , he came to Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White , the name of &quot; Fischer &quot; into the game , who decided to take over the direction of October 1st , and altern@@ ate with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this is in each case a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; valuation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the area &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inn@@ ere medicine , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for cardi@@ ovas@@ cular and de@@ fi@@ br@@ ill@@ ators .

compar@@ atively for the next two years , fishermen with his team is to give up fishermen with his team when the Supervisory Board has led to both houses , until then next year the former Hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ ers , has finally closed over 35 beds to almost 140 years .
so far , the land@@ mark had been planned for 2018 , if the current rest@@ au@@ ration will be completed at the hospital in W@@ eil@@ heim .
Land@@ r@@ ät@@ in Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White , who also meet the chairman of the Supervisory Board , entered the house , which is in the possession of the Bundes@@ kn@@ app@@ antry , which should be used as an accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I close it out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to continue with the property , Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White not say there are several refl@@ ections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of the car@@ itas and a day@@ esp@@ sy@@ at@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what it could not happen to us such an opportunity not come back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such as fishermen about the Qu@@ asi Move to the Le@@ ch who have been received by the employees &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understand@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house , where fishermen has been working for over 30 years as sur@@ geon .

in the inter@@ ven@@ ing of the 20 year , the young people killed and their body was thrown into a channel in Rock@@ enhausen .

refugees need accommodation : study war@@ ned in front of housing
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
even more refugees are looking for a paid p@@ enter .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing construction stands in front of a challenge .
the distribution struggles on the German housing market have long been begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the coming refugees and job seek@@ ers from the EU still pus@@ hing more people on a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you compete with income of weak citizens around the last be@@ atable apartments .
to cover the demand for paid apartments , it would have to be built by 2020 every year 40@@ 0.000 new units .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to this result a study on behalf of the trade @-@ forces &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
compared to this year , Germany 26@@ 0,000 units are finished .
so that we are missing 14@@ 0,000 apartments .
refugees are no longer required for the first three months of their stay , as an asylum seek@@ ers in an initial tour of accommodation .
many come across the housing market and ranks into the long sn@@ akes before the rental apartments .
according to the statistical Bundes@@ amt dwelt in the last year less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers available for rent .
however , the negative development of the resi@@ des are however not only to the rising refuge@@ e camps .
the study also makes substantial lifts in the construction of the last few years .
Germany poses a residential defic@@ it in front of it that is bigger from year to year .
currently faul@@ ts in the met@@ ropol@@ itan areas already around 77@@ 0,000 dwellings , cl@@ oned Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many ess@@ enti@@ ces are therefore in big cities not@@ with@@ dr@@ ations in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults stayed because of the flo@@ at on the apartment market un@@ voluntary longer in the &quot; Hotel M@@ um . &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita was dropped once again in the past few years .
to solve the problem , the alliance is social housing to start a rest@@ art .
the new incentives to stimulate the social housing for the social housing .
so this might be disp@@ at@@ ed@@ ed on the ridge that may be susp@@ ended and the basic tax for sponsored apartments are exposed to be exposed .
moreover , according to the alli@@ zing attractive tax @-@ pro@@ men@@ tions necessary .
the funding programme for refugees in the state K@@ f@@ W is now working well in towns and villages .
a good week after the start was started with 184 million euros over half of the currently available around 300 million euros .
now the project could even be sho@@ cked .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia to cor@@ ridor
there is practically no more inf@@ all over Croatia , more and more refugees continue on the road over Croatia .
Zagreb pre@@ aches to grant transit through Slovenia to north without hur@@ d@@ les .
dangerous is the route but still .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ ridor for refugees .
&quot; I talked to the Sloven@@ ian indoor Minister , and when it is necessary , we will arrange a cor@@ ridor , &quot; said the Croatian internal Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already one of the Schengen area .
EU @-@ country Croatia has not yet been a Schengen country .
after the de@@ part of the Ser@@ b@@ isch @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees crossing to Croatia to arrive from there to Western Europe .
500 people came across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reported the Croatian TV @-@ C@@ RT@@ L .
Hungary had mir@@ r@@ ored its border to refugees before the day before .
new laws , which occurred on the same day in force , make it an extraordinary asylum procedure in Hungary to super@@ flu@@ ous .
Croatia wants to leave the refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can go through and we prepare for that possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , people do not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police took up the early refugees from the border of Serbia on the border of Serbia in Croatia in the morning .
most of the media reporting was reported from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they arrived at both the bus and the taxi in the Ser@@ bian border town S@@ ID .
immediately after their arrival they would have tried to go on foot across the green border to Croatia .
on the Croatian @-@ Ser@@ b border the refugees encounter not occur in the Gren@@ zz@@ ences .
this holds the border pat@@ ron of other dangers . there are still sharp min@@ als from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
min@@ ef@@ sp@@ ati@@ al is now to create a secure passage .
after Hungary there are barely more refugees after the closing of the border .
on Tuesday the police of 366 asc@@ ended people .
shortly before the gate on Monday we had been around 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws levels the over@@ coming and damage the Gren@@ zz@@ as is a criminal .
in the Southern Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eged , therefore 35 criminal proceedings were introduced .
the condem@@ ned adhesi@@ on Ar@@ tis@@ ing up to five years and the deport@@ ations from the country .
according to information by the immigration Authority , one took on Tuesday to the new on the border with &quot; Tran@@ se@@ ons &quot; a total of 94 asylum , including almost all - 93 - the most important transition short@@ age .
among the applic@@ ators , 13 families with small children and two elderly people .
at the middle of the morning , there would have had 40 refugees from there .
however , no one has a view to get a view in Hungary asylum .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after an hung@@ arian view , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers should be down@@ wards there .
in front of the &quot; RFID @-@ zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke gathered only a few hundred refugees among themselves .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke started working with it .
they gathered the tr@@ ash into the tr@@ ash that had left the tens of thousands of people over the past weeks .
barrier were destroyed and one of the pay@@ load in the border location was rebuilt .
for the purpose of this radical change nobody wanted to vo@@ iced .
Austria can only reach Austria after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country has also enhanced its border controls .
around 20,000 migrants are still held by government agencies , but still in the country .
in Salzburg there are approximately 1400 people waiting for the journey to Germany .
the public transport from there to Germany was stopped in the morning by the German public authorities .
in free@@ ze , smaller groups of refugees met by foot on foot .
Mayor of the Ges@@ hur@@ d@@ spoke &quot; over the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were focused on Sunday with show@@ rooms when suddenly ten people were standing with tour operators at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wern@@ ig@@ one Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted by train to Passau .
because Germany ended up on Sunday but because of the refuge@@ e stream the railway transport with Austria was surprising , she immediately offered its help and the but@@ chers , along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars on the border into the city of Passau .
before we have seen the un@@ hop@@ ed guests only even con@@ sol@@ ed with J@@ ause and drinks .
we have equal to , we bring it by car to Passau .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a matter of course &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; just Stad@@ ler in O@@ Ö@@ N talk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not allow him to pass a generous donation - 100 Euros for fire fighting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this made us very happy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the atten@@ de@@ es took up on Sunday evening in Wels from a ICE head to Passau , in order to Passau , in order to advance it after the short @-@ term pro@@ cl@@ amation , that the railway traffic to Germany has been set to Germany yet , yet over the border to try .
but the regional representative was placed before the border in Wern@@ stein at the inn .
in Wern@@ stein , the cross @-@ border general is generally high in the course .
the Br@@ ücken@@ fest is soci@@ able with the Bav@@ arian neighbours on Sunday before a two @-@ format sports - organized by the Union of Wern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has now sent more to@@ ber@@ thousand of us , is a logical result of a apparent policy :
instead of helping in the camp R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately in the establishment of structures , humanity , our Federal Chancellor , has been officially recognised and publicly expressed the attitude of the Hungarian government in the dun@@ ge@@ circle of nation@@ alism .
Lei@@ d@@ ant of these policies are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now faced in border areas with cha@@ otic states .
also the p@@ oultry will need to say that the &quot; yellow country , &quot; which it invited and welcome , nothing but another refuge@@ e camp is .
it will be a great challenge due to the continuing refuge@@ e flows and the nearby winter , to produce decent @-@ stands for prot@@ ectors .
and there will be an even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria .

Kon@@ rad has full to do with the e @-@ ordin@@ ance of all hands .
Christian Kon@@ rad is used to have his word weight .
the government has used the former mighty Rai@@ ff@@ eisen @-@ ban@@ ker to present a lod@@ g@@ ings for the thousand refugees .
the chaos in the first year of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already received Kon@@ rad already in the grip .
&quot; we do not have a hom@@ eless , more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the accommodation of 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without great vort@@ ex , Kon@@ rad and pra@@ ised the organisational &quot; master@@ piece &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cr@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
altogether , Kon@@ rad expects a requirement of 8@@ 5,000 Quar@@ az@@ ing in the he@@ ap year .
to meet the number , must be found in the next weeks still 35,@@ 000 accommodations - 20,000 should provide the countries , 15,@@ 000 of the federal government .
should it be more refugees away , we can create it .
&quot; but there is no barrel without floor , &quot; said Con@@ rad .
with the state capital he has already led talks .
these could not have saved him , even for the coming refugees to create Qu@@ arti@@ s .
&quot; in Ober@@ österreich runs it well , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Kon@@ rad .
tomorrow it will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , in doing so , how the church is going to be clari@@ fied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the big expectations of the asylum @-@ ordinator is also based on OR@@ F Action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ps like we &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform we can offer private people un@@ complicated accommodation .
moreover one hopes for hotels that are empty during winter .
Kon@@ rad and Ma@@ ier has critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as a &quot; very high . &quot;
in emergen@@ cies , we cannot be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ator must have a certain height of the hand@@ y @-@ card or size of the ceiling .
for a free@@ ze time would need to apply .
that he was successful in opposition to the German Ministry for Economic Affairs , a Con@@ rad with his experience .
I am an older master , which one does not even says in the face the in@@ tru@@ st@@ ness .
belief force is his most important weapon .
Kon@@ rad and Ma@@ ier do not cause any costs as they made themselves .
they want to increase their number of employees on three to four .
the own Qu@@ arti@@ ch@@ u@@ che has not been successfully successful .
Kon@@ rad wanted a container on the st@@ eri@@ li@@ ment as an office .
but there is apparently problems with the approval .
Linz is calling a better distribution
only no opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings like tips @-@ Arena and design Center for lodging of refugees planning the city of Linz .
at the moment it is not necessary , as we can present the people affected without these measures , says Mayor Klaus L@@ ug@@ er ( SP ) .
however , for the emergency purposes but further locations are to be tested on their di@@ vin@@ ity .
criticism of the cit@@ ations on the division of refugees during the Bundes@@ land@@ ing .
other areas have to make their contribution here .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; limits are not mir@@ r@@ ored &quot;
in a longer telephone call with the Bav@@ arian Minister of Horst Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ govern@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( FB ) on Monday the other steps in the refuge@@ e question .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer has assured me that the German borders will not be gr@@ illed .
further journey of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany continue to be possible .
however , I now give the appropriate border controls .
there will be no more special benefits to Germany with refugees in Germany .
but the prot@@ ectors would however have been with regular bree@@ ders to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states called once more reinforced solidarity in the refuge@@ e question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that now Austria will resume Austria to its borders , is for P@@ stir@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of action of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a matter of time
the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neues Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the left industries is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production location of the stock IT Group S &amp; T pul@@ led , the rest ( 2700 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology branch .
&quot; in the IT the clever heads our raw material - and we must try that they work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he could imagine , invest in Start@@ up @-@ firms of the New Wer@@ ft Group and later on which to act as well .
already from the start I want to collabor@@ ate with the new neighb@@ ors - where Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises some promises : &quot; the next R@@ unt@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
1.7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ center , which is one third of the city of Linz , the land of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is p@@ aired by the Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ center .
30 percent of the Fort@@ ress in the building are already rented for further 40 percent .
lia @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ it opened second shop in the arc@@ ade
in the new shop Fur@@ la @-@ hand@@ bags are at the centre .
actually J@@ utta has wanted to set a dog .
this project had to penet@@ rate the 49 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ owner of L@@ ia Per@@ oni in the exchange rates t@@ anning : finally she has now got to get entries in the form of another business location .
in the fur@@ la @-@ shop opposite the business , in which they sold under other po@@ ckets , suit@@ cases , shoes and tissue of different manufacturers , sp@@ un all around Dam@@ en@@ hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are from 75 Euro to have .
larger po@@ ckets and accessories are charged up to 500 Euros .
since yesterday the new shop is in operation .
previously , several weeks has been changed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long over@@ lay if I should open up even a store , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says wide . &quot; &quot; &quot;
decisive factors for the decision was among other things , that also the fur@@ la producers who are at home from the idea of a dedicated site , where only their hand@@ bags sel@@ ls are being sold to .
&quot; we are the base in the big room Linz , which sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has their own Italian roots .
your fashion interest has given wide from her mother to the cr@@ adle .
remember that most when something develops and I can show new trends at high @-@ performance prices .
why so some women in sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in p@@ impl@@ ant , it can also not answer the lady with last security .
perhaps it is that a nice bag is for each out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ul@@ lj@@ es@@ writer from K@@ all@@ stadt
the we@@ al@@ zer of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose local population has been called .
this property combines man@@ ners as well as with the milli@@ ard who wants to become president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for sti@@ ckers .
whether he emerged as a foreign @-@ enemy , journ@@ alist or dis@@ g@@ aps revealed or dis@@ g@@ aps in the international crisis policy - the applic@@ ant for the US presidential system could be vig@@ orous in favour of the election campaign .
and cuts good on it .
this is also registered in the pf@@ alz region of K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate annually origin@@ ates .
the New Yor@@ ker with the Com@@ promis@@ ingly is a word in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the Wein@@ straße .
man@@ cher in the 1200 @-@ inhabitants @-@ site is related to the old corners of him .
his grand@@ si@@ re came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in the elect@@ oral College .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del swi@@ vel a movie about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his aim , leg@@ acy man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that somehow was exciting , but in their k@@ all@@ boy , but not so deeply impressed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has a am@@ using documentary on the place and its famous in@@ spec@@ ers , to which beside Tr@@ ump were also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up @-@ Family Heinz ranks .
Tr@@ ump which is not known for mod@@ est , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) also too words - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in Cape Town .
to the king of the heart he did not have it .
although I give respect for the performance of the family , but also ten@@ den@@ ial the opinion that Tr@@ ump is already a bit a big mouth , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
acci@@ dental ven@@ ing of the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the radius , &quot; The Br@@ ul@@ lj@@ ko@@ macher &quot; - zu High@@ lands : the offerings , says it .
Tr@@ ump is thus from the village of the Offer .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began 1885 , when the later grand@@ father was emig@@ rated and opened in the US a loc@@ ale for gold @-@ makers .
Grund@@ stein of the real estate concept was first property @-@ sales in New York .
but the life of grand@@ parents was not free from Trag@@ ic : their desire to return to the home , fail on the Bav@@ arian state , which belong@@ ed to the Palat@@ inate back then .
he did not go Tr@@ ump , because he once was shot without permission , the director of the Institute for pf@@ alz History and Pop@@ ular , Roland Paul , to the film start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is reflected in contrast to the ranks of the after@@ math .
he had repeated re@@ sus@@ cep@@ tible to Mexican immigrants in the US and called the building of a border @-@ wall to des@@ per@@ ate illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the pol@@ arity , this is not so sympath@@ etic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relationship &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The O@@ ma was a n@@ dest Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was blow@@ n Heinz &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the win@@ em@@ akers in retirement is seen the Americans rather dis@@ soci@@ ated , &quot; he is always so up@@ gra@@ zing . &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump comes from ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot imagine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he never came about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reti@@ ant techniques mentioned as man@@ cher K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a desc@@ endant of the Family Heinz when visiting something for the church , which ended in general well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can not be revealed to me of the Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they f@@ ares it better if he does not dar@@ es , for &quot; who has such a radic@@ als , I do not know if the good is . &quot;
if those who had the time of his grand@@ father in the US the S@@ ages had been , would have been , if he had never had arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting subjects than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah B@@ ühler .
and as President ?
&quot; my president is not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are also without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
W@@ end@@ els film , for the ump long inter@@ viewed , have seen 12 000 Kin@@ og@@ gles , also in the USA which awak@@ ens the interest .

seven &apos; s Sun@@ rise is domin@@ ates the reviews , despite the attempts of N@@ ine , the loss of the ex@@ ecu@@ tives at the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wilk@@ inson share to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report in the loss of the leadership of the Liber@@ als , but it has no major shi@@ fts on the reviews for today .
the breakfast show of N@@ ine was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the federal capital , as Mal@@ col@@ m turn@@ out the over@@ throw of Tony Ab@@ b@@ ott .

this dis@@ advantage of the condition seemed to play no role for au@@ str@@ al TV spect@@ ators , since Sun@@ rise is an average $ 000 spect@@ ators among the five main cities , compared to today Casino Articles 000 .
today , a slight increase compared to the ratings on Monday ( 317.@@ 000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today the gap has over the last months the gap to Sun@@ rise is closed .
the average of August present at the average of 318.@@ 000 in comparison to the 33@@ 0.000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,@@ 000 and 5@@ 0,000 .
so far in September there is sunrise at the average 34@@ 9.@@ 000 spect@@ ators to 314.@@ 000 at today .
this is the most interesting what happened every morning .
the winds of the change are more than the parliament more than the Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are just fine , thanks for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive de@@ but of 800 words with former serial star of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new dr@@ ama on a recently conf@@ isc@@ ated father , who ent@@ ru@@ sted with his two children on the coast of New Zealand , has reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million spect@@ ators .

the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; Yes . &quot;

the final three agree with the Bachelor of Sam wood is the perfect man - but whom will it be ?
un@@ v@@ eil@@ ed ? ...
Lana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have uncomfortable to who The Bachelor wins .
the woman , at Sam Wood in The Bachelor finally arose , was wr@@ apped in greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three left un@@ even girls will certainly not indicate , whether it is the one that has received the last rose .
but when we with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows am day , before consisting of three two , you possibly have acci@@ dent@@ ally gave an indication of who the vic@@ tori@@ ous will be .
sam Wood keeps its lips up to the finale on the Thursday se@@ aled
all three women found himself out why wood is the perfect man and thus the sense of humor , ambi@@ tion , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you who should get W@@ oods last rose ? &apos; , their answers to the game applic@@ ants will become who the heart of the Bachelor &apos;s won .
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki t@@ anned both quickly - except itself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner in for wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam wood have had one simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went into the house and Sam@@ os energies , I noticed that they were pretty compatible , and I thought that in the whole course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah is standing with both feet on Earth , it is so much fun to be together with her , &quot; added mark@@ os@@ ki .
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
you feel comfortable and comfortable together .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay thinks that her and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
from their point of view M@@ ack@@ ay said that the land@@ se last week it made clear that wood &quot; the One can be .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I saw him with my friends and the family , I was clear that this obviously not only a game - I am now p@@ ending on him , &quot; said she . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked to whom Wood were sol@@ sti@@ le , if not them , there she was en@@ vi@@ bran@@ t .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say this , &quot; she said .
I love the left un@@ even girls equally - it is a le@@ ague between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lana .
the Bachelor &apos;s going on Wednesday , 19 : 30 clock , on Ten broadcast .

J@@ persist@@ y@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to begin its NF@@ L career .
Det@@ ro@@ it and Seattle showed great interest for his move into the USA - and there were many other teams working according to his monum@@ ental training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach J@@ im Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a clinical decision .
some trainers would have Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to b@@ anned the bank as he lost a sm@@ ug@@ by @-@ le@@ by le@@ ague on Tuesday , at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula tru@@ ged his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to return to a p@@ unt Return and also into the ongoing game after an injury to Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula showed to continue his true face in the lo@@ cker room after the game .
instead of his rook@@ ies against the rest of the team by the Mill into grinding , encouraged them .
Tom@@ an@@ ula strength@@ ens the public at its press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ re@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne also has been encouraged by speci@@ alt@@ e@@ ams @-@ Co@@ ordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who ri@@ pped his pal@@ p@@ her f@@ ang and to take care of the next game .
J@@ arr@@ ho@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ sy at a P@@ unt which was restored in the first quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
there was certainly not the start to get the Hay@@ ne and his massive au@@ str@@ al@@ gic emotions for his NF@@ L Deb@@ ut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field and told later the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not be a deteri@@ or@@ ably start into his NF@@ L career .
&quot; it was a thing that now occurs , one takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne .
Hay@@ ne conf@@ essing the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in Deb@@ ut at that time in 2007 , when a pass at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area lead to a tr@@ y for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

four people , including a 4 @-@ year group , were killed in southern Nepal after the police of Gum@@ mig@@ esch@@ os@@ se have to demonstrate against the proposed new Constitution , said an official on Wednesday .
the violence broke up on the ma@@ i@@ eve in the district of Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi , about 175 miles west from the capital city Kath@@ mand@@ u .
Bis@@ hn@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad Dh@@ ak@@ al , conduc@@ tive District Apostle said that more than 1,000 prot@@ esters are gathered outside a police station , with some of you h@@ els and fire bom@@ bs .
Mr Dh@@ ak@@ h said the police have spar@@ kl@@ ed tr@@ ades and then shot into the air before they get at Gum@@ mig@@ esch@@ os@@ se .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were wo@@ und@@ ed , he said .
it was not immediately clear on why the used rubber are known that they can &apos;t be used , but traditionally used as less de@@ adly alternative , clearly in@@ duced a high death rate .
the examination was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nep@@ als in southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ il@@ i say that new provinces , which will be formed in the framework of the proposed new constitution .
there were also protests in Nepal by the ethnic group of Th@@ u , which want to have his own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 Poli@@ zei@@ un@@ am@@ te , were in violent disputes since 10 .
August killed , when the four major political parties signed an agreement , the country in provinces , - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very contro@@ versi@@ al issue in Nepal , that has been centrally ruled out .
working on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ator acceler@@ ated the process after the devast@@ ating earthqu@@ akes that had killed in April thousands of men .
the legisl@@ ature have adjusted these week over certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional design in Kath@@ mand@@ u , and officials have said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .

Google Play a double @-@ based don@@ ate campaign to earn 11 million $ for refugees
Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . o ) announced a dou@@ bling don@@ ate campaign to promote 11 million $ for humanitarian agencies to give thousands of thousands of refugees who over@@ rol@@ men the European nations as they escape from war and im@@ pover@@ ished .
Google has un@@ usually personal approach to announc@@ ing the donation from donations to his blog .
instead of making a manager making the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google @-@ employee , who had es@@ cap@@ ed with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to our trip belong@@ ed to many dark railway and bus trips , as hunger , thir@@ st , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refuge@@ e crisis and migrants are grown in Europe , many people like my family des@@ per@@ ately been asking for help .
the donations will go to four char@@ itable organisations who provide help for refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High @-@ Ac@@ ar for refugees .
Google said that the first global clu@@ stered donations will be dou@@ bled up to a value of 5.5 million to $ 20 million in $ 17 million .
Europe is faced with its worst refuge@@ e crisis since World War II , largely causing by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , more than 4 million people displ@@ aced this year .

for slightly overweight di@@ ab@@ e@@ tics can be a weight loss of surgery .
the advantages of weight loss for slightly over@@ overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for a new study at least five years .
it is still early to say whether easily overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mort@@ ality data require a long time to show something &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , which wrote a leading article to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery .
weight loss or Adi@@ pos@@ itas surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body @-@ own ability to ab@@ sorb food .
over the years , Adi@@ pos@@ itas operations proved successful in treatment of type @-@ 2 diabetes as an efficient , but most studies have been performed on people who are path@@ y cas@@ ual with a Body @-@ M@@ ass @-@ Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain level of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18,@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I of 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study researchers we use Tai@@ pe@@ an Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data which has collected since 2007 in a study and compare two types of Adi@@ pos@@ itas surgery - Mag@@ enb@@ yp@@ ass and Mag@@ y@@ sm@@ elling treatment - medical treatments for type @-@ 2 diabetes by people who were easily overweight .
the average BM@@ I under which this operation is under@@ gone , decre@@ ased from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained with those who did not @-@ surgical diabetes treatments were about equal to 29 .
among those who under@@ went on a surgical procedure , rede@@ emed you with 36 % of diabetes @-@ disorder completely and at 28 % in part .
in the medical @-@ treated group , in comparison to diabetes , diabetes is completely only at one percent and sometimes in only two percent .
in addition , the results were found in the controls of blood pressure , the Trig@@ ly@@ c@@ eride and the &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L Chol@@ ester@@ ins &quot; generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , found the authors .
the researchers also monitored the patient @-@ blood level of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels in the course of time .
hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c is considered best under 7 percent , write the resear@@ cher .
after the surgery the average hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c levels of around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but these better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - like you reflects in the improved her@@ b of A@@ 1@@ c levels - did not reduce the mort@@ ality in five years , so the leading scientists Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also achiev@@ es average results with the two types of surgery .
in fifth year , the B@@ yp@@ ass Surgery Clinic had lost more weight ( 18,@@ 7 v@@ s. 14,@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater back@@ outputs in the BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 against 5.1 ) and hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % v@@ s. 2.@@ 1 % ) and fin@@ alist rather a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % v@@ s. 16,@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival for the surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of serious people in Sweden that surgery lead to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was obes@@ e people who under@@ went to a Adi@@ pos@@ itas surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group , the conventional methods tried .
although the new study had no benefit for survival in the surgery patient , Black@@ stone , it is so@@ othing for people with a BM@@ I under 35 , which are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , without increased risk of death or kid@@ ney disease , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously as soon as the patient with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 lies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting for long until we take people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said she . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think that once they have accumul@@ ated these gene@@ tic changes that have linked their body with obes@@ ity and diabetes is a re@@ vers@@ al truly difficult . &quot;

&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe could not take all refugees away , the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to refuge@@ e crisis in the Middle East was left . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ti@@ be@@ tically Buddh@@ ist leader addresses them to end the violence in the hom@@ etown of refugees .
the Dalai Lama declared the problem of the devast@@ ated refuge@@ e crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit in the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford , which is devoted to eth@@ ics studies .
he requested that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of individual nations or even continent .
he emphas@@ ised that the reaction of Western European countries at the refuge@@ e crisis will not be given to the refuge@@ e crisis , but the situation is not reasonable .
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech .
although the Dalai Lama of Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in addressing the crisis is pra@@ ised , he said that there is only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long term solutions like a real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ultimately we must remember how the tones is reduced in their countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reduce the use of force . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of force has never been solved in these problems , &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama declared the problem of violence and comm@@ ented by George Bush &apos;s action after the terror@@ ist attack from September 11 , and turned out that the violent reaction of the USA went over a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 I pushed my bone in a letter to President Obama , and I told him the way to resolve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; I know his moti@@ ves were good , but he sat force one ; and this has given un@@ expected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama .
four rise of intake of des@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the past 4 years
Gi@@ ft@@ on@@ oun centers in the USA report about a nearly 400 @-@ percentage increase in the number of children under twelve years of inf@@ ect@@ ants , so the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. G@@ ay@@ l@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , decre@@ ases the cases of revenue of inf@@ ect@@ ant inf@@ ect@@ ant with children under 12 years , the tox@@ ic@@ acy centers will report about 3,@@ 266 in 2010 on 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children often come more frequently to those products , and s@@ adly there is a percentage of them go into emergency , &quot; said Lop@@ ez C@@ NN .
he said that some children dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants can be seen , while some of it do to im@@ press their friends or because of a mut@@ rehear@@ sal with social media .
videos on YouTube show how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants can only be found because of a budget experience .
young people are supp@@ os@@ edly dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with soft m@@ outh@@ wash , to obtain a t@@ oug@@ her drink .
younger children can be stretched by attractive fragran@@ ces of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the attractive stri@@ es ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are ready @-@ to .
there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant with pe@@ ers , grapes and orange r@@ ots that are very appe@@ aling for children .
hang@@ ing inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 per cent alcohol .
especially in small children you can already cause a few spl@@ itting up for alcohol po@@ ison@@ ing .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the Gi@@ ft@@ not@@ ru@@ f@@ Center in the Hospital of the University of Kan@@ sas , the Sender Fox 4 in Kan@@ sa City .
so , you would not leave a cl@@ uck whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants within reach of children , and if children come back then it is a quick way to consu@@ me much alcohol .
N@@ hai@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year old girl who had recently taken four spra@@ w@@ berries from a stra@@ wberry sm@@ elling in the school , was taken into a emergency treatment .
her blood @-@ alco@@ ho@@ ation was 179 , twice higher than the thres@@ hold , which is in an adult at the same place , Dr. Chris rit@@ ch@@ ey , a not@@ ary doctor who treated it in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ hai@@ jah l@@ all@@ ed their words and was not able to go when she arrived in emergency measures .
the doctors super@@ vised by night in a separate nur@@ ser@@ y clinic on signs of Hir@@ n trau@@ ma , since the girl was through the alcohol and had its head down , Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; this was very wor@@ ris@@ ome , &quot; said Or@@ tor@@ ia Scott , N@@ hai@@ j@@ ahs mother , C@@ NN .
it could have to be de@@ adly for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers , non @-@ alco@@ holic products or dis@@ inf@@ ants to use and hand@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant outside the reach of the child .
beyond alcohol po@@ ison@@ ing out were some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with deaths .
in the year 2013 , two women were killed in Ont@@ ario women after sl@@ u@@ cks of incl@@ in@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , which had an tox@@ ic , un@@ declared ingre@@ dient .
employees of health authorities susp@@ ect that the product feature meth@@ anol , a fat@@ al solution , instead of eth@@ anol , which was noted as a drug .
in January Plan@@ ten three students of the fourth category in the state of New York , their &quot; gem@@ ent@@ alists &quot; con@@ gen@@ dered by anti @-@ bacter@@ ial products around the class@@ room , &quot; so have a police report .
the teacher is highly gra@@ vely allergic to the dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant inf@@ ect@@ ants and hi@@ mi@@ te them from their room .

the prison authorities say that I can not be a witness and a journ@@ alist , so it will not allow me to take a not@@ ebook and a bul@@ b to take care of what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journ@@ alist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma describe me on Twitter , my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the spring , as it wants and you get access .
I believe me with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it sp@@ ati@@ te that it could have said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could have better form@@ ulate , &quot; but still think it is wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard K@@ os@@ si@@ p had problems with some of the things I said and written .
he does not tell me what I have to write , and I would not do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove myself from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants that an international re@@ por@@ ter is present to write there .
if he dies , he thinks that public@@ ity work can help the movement against death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ vocation of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , is beside me sitting beside me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I have done .
I do not want to go back all the details here .
I can not say with certainty that Richard Gl@@ os@@ si@@ p is in@@ no@@ cent .
his actions after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guil@@ ty to be a benefici@@ ary of act .
but I believe that a strong lik@@ eli@@ hood is that he is not guil@@ ty of the mor@@ ality .
I sh@@ allow that there is not enough evidence to justi@@ fy a death .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective I will see him dying .
I can not claim to be truly objective .
there will be other Rep@@ or@@ ter to which you can turn for this .
what you get from me is what it means to see a man an un@@ necessary death .
man after hum@@ id police @-@ tracking , from the Cann@@ ing River to come
the Cann@@ ing V@@ ale Poli@@ in@@ ist was dry , when he sp@@ ake the man from the Cann@@ ing river .
an attempt of a man of Per@@ th to cut the police , was un@@ successful than he was in the s@@ eich@@ ed and su@@ mp@@ ed water was , just a few meters from a pol@@ ishing sh@@ am@@ ples , which tried to return , &quot; him g@@ ently to return , to the bank . &quot;
the police of Cann@@ ing V@@ ale was born on Tuesday to a household break@@ down in Beck@@ ett .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , tried to discover them towards Cann@@ ing River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water - and said , &quot; I &apos;m not coming out , command@@ ing and hol , &quot; he said Senior Serge@@ ant Sh@@ and@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ ine .
Con@@ stable Sal@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too thrilled about it , his uni@@ shape , therefore , he turned out a depend@@ able tac@@ tics - &quot; A good pol@@ ishing is negoti@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try , &quot; he said Senior ge@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ ine .
master @-@ so@@ cc@@ er Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 C@@ ous@@ ins had his car in the dit@@ ch in order to pull off a alcohol control and tried to swim over the Swan River .

Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claimed that ste@@ wards try to send him to the race and dro@@ ht to end the race sport
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claimed that ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria is trying to install a sp@@ y over the past year to install and dro@@ pping the race immediately .
he quot@@ ed on the ste@@ wards and the Integr@@ ated Department of Racing Victoria and all@@ eged to give her a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai due to a race @-@ day treatment , carried out of the last Stro@@ h@@ hal@@ m on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax media , that he always tries to do what is best for the racing sport and he found himself under difficult conditions than the positive b@@ alt test for Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had res@@ trained for 18 months due to the es@@ pion@@ age and did not want to see that it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too high hang@@ ing grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have long before eating , but sometimes you are so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you know that it went forward .
sometimes it respon@@ ds and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with it what I have said .
today I will go home to@@ night and sleep well .
I would like to go about , and I want to think that my owners think that I try my best for her .
when they start thinking , I do not do it , then I should not be a trainer .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
before , M@@ oo@@ dy had made the bom@@ b in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the Integr@@ ated Department had tried to produce his barn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ago Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart in a room with a man - that I will be asked , to deliver information about what I do within my st@@ alls , to deliver , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing.com . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they do believe that I am a che@@ at .
if that is the case , they certainly ought to touch on their n@@ apped because it is trying to summar@@ ised me when trying to post .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , eh@@ em . Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , acting President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ as , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of the time and are still alive today .
should I bring myself to the mind that it is personally going to be ?
has the R@@ V@@ L behavior and perhaps people are responsible outside of trainers , what is happening in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
perhaps the people are out there , that I am .
perhaps they have to take me my license and come to me , and I have no doubt that what I say , she now might think about it now .
but now I arrived at the point where me that is no matter , and that makes me sad .
this really makes me sad .
I will exercise the pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the fru@@ stration of the Train@@ ers made himself up with the long lasting go@@ at in Li@@ dar@@ i and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching led to that he said that he could have his license on the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ trained Masters Black &amp; , &quot; the race @-@ day treatment &quot; was ri@@ dic@@ ulous , &quot; after a pack of mu@@ d or sound on hor@@ seb@@ ack , which was sp@@ elling against the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing sports . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to take full responsibility for this , he said .
&quot; one of my employees has er@@ ron@@ ably mu@@ d on the B@@ ein .
it could have been this evening yesterday evening .
it would have been so yesterday all day so that was so .
but it also had such a race .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be faced with a three @-@ month discount for treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who raised these rules don &apos;t know about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you went too far , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy .

Melbourne @-@ Storm - Cra@@ ig Bell@@ am@@ y pro@@ poses to ring stocks
Melbourne @-@ Shop @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ am@@ y has been criticism of the bac@@ kl@@ ing of his players as &quot; Agenda Sett@@ ing &quot; of two Premier League favourites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robins@@ on said that the refer@@ ee of the F@@ allen @-@ players &quot; ring &quot; fought with his team during the high Storm victory in Sydney on Fri@@ day@@ Eve .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bronze Group Way@@ ne B@@ enn@@ ett made a little conf@@ lic@@ ate note to the Storm team , after his team scor@@ ing the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land C@@ ow@@ boys in the evening . he realized the game a &quot; Mu@@ ster@@ e@@ play &quot; of the R@@ ug@@ by League and said that the two of Que@@ ens@@ land was not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in R@@ ingen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ am@@ y def@@ ended the T@@ ack@@ li@@ mg of his team and said that they are concentrated on their &quot; contact with a bac@@ kl@@ ing . &quot;
Bell@@ am@@ y added that the review of two leading trainers in his team was confident , since it de@@ ute that they made him to be worried about the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this emerg@@ es again - I don &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robins@@ on talked about Ring @-@ batt@@ les , when she cast us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ am@@ y on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have changed a real emphasis throughout the year . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with bac@@ kl@@ es for a real main focus .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to exercise . it is therefore probably not to be used to lose , so it was a bit of shock for him .
it is already com@@ ical , as this is turning back on this season .
Bell@@ am@@ y has attacked B@@ enn@@ ese idea from the &quot; exciting so@@ cc@@ er &quot; and his ment@@ or remin@@ ded that B@@ enn@@ ets St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra led the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting so@@ cc@@ er .
he was compared his play on Satur@@ days evening with our on Fri@@ day@@ Eve , and how exciting their game was , &quot; said Bell@@ am@@ y .
I remember that in 2010 St George as a boring team cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed , and Way@@ ne said that he will take a divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team who can play and that we watch as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
that is the Ball@@ et , which one wants to play when you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not each team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford , and Ben Hunt , making them like these play .
I build a better confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing around us .
six weeks ago they probably did not think of us when it comes to the big Games .
Bell@@ am@@ y pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters a higher result obtained as the game Bron@@ cos against C@@ ow@@ boys .
the game of the bronze was probably a good game , I have not seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two further trials in our game , but is that a exciting game ?
or are Pau@@ wel@@ s do not make any points something exciting ?
for me it is the g@@ aps .
if they mention us , it means that we will meet at a stage still upon them .
the Storm team has won at this weekend as they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land C@@ ow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks at the next Sam@@ son &apos;s final evening at the A@@ AMI Park . the ticket sales starts from the next morning .
Ser@@ bier with 20@@ 0,000 $ deposit according to drug Clin@@ ical
a man who might be threat@@ ens a life penalty due to his experim@@ ental , into the possession of 40 k@@ ilo@@ grams Kok@@ ain who were s@@ orted by Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of 20@@ 0,000 $ .
Mar@@ ko Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested the last month after the Federal Police was 100 kg of the dro@@ ves on the yacht Sol@@ ay found in South America on V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed as he took his pe@@ dic@@ ated in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police took about 40 k@@ ilo@@ grams of the drug in one To@@ y@@ ota E@@ cho .
despite a potentially lon@@ gest penalty for the attempt to own a commercial amount co@@ at , ar@@ gu@@ essed of the law@@ yer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic that he tried no evidence that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the café from a harm@@ less reason could be .
the judge by the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter Sch@@ ag@@ an was worried about the river @-@ threat near Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travelled to Serbia , &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday .
in the pr@@ isons of trial , he also bel@@ lied the police of his position .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vi@@ cs mother and st@@ ep@@ father had a deposit of 20@@ 0,000 Dollar as security together to achieve his release .
&quot; following the reading from the two persons , it is clear that the edition of a security of 20@@ 0,000 Dollar is a real financial burden , &quot; said judges fl@@ ag@@ an .
but that alone is not enough to keep it from it , not to appear , war@@ ned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against a deposit , among the conditions that he announces his au@@ str@@ alian origin and its Ser@@ b pass , which stops the police daily and holds itself to a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

J@@ VA Berlin @-@ T@@ egel : five square meter pig@@ s are humane
the Federal Constitu@@ tional Court has given an ex @-@ prisoners of the J@@ us@@ tic@@ ultur@@ al compl@@ aint , the monthly el@@ ang is housed in one to small cell .
because of the violation of their human dignity , in@@ mates are generally entitled to financial compensation , when they are housed in small cells .
that has decided the Federal Constitu@@ tional Court in a Wednesday published decision .
people may expect the Rich@@ tern even then to money if they were only a few days in the con@@ fin@@ ed spaces ( A@@ Z . : 1 Bv@@ R 1127 / 14 ) .
in this way a ex @-@ prisoners with his breeding is successful in Karlsruhe : he was housed in the J@@ us@@ tic@@ ultur@@ al Berlin @-@ T@@ egel between June and November 2009 in a single cell line of around five square meters floor space ; the toilet was sp@@ ati@@ al not separated .
after that , the man was once again on the right foot in the open fork again , in a larger cell .
his am@@ t@@ sh@@ af@@ res@@ age because of the un@@ worthy sti@@ p@@ conditions against the land of Berlin fail .
but the constitutional mag@@ ist@@ ing the judgment of the chamber Berlin on and transferred to the case to renewed testing there .
you will see the man &apos;s dignity .
Kam@@ mer@@ dish decide now above the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons of the frag@@ ile period only a few days in days for compensation shall be significant , be a compensation , was called it .
otherwise , &quot; an un@@ v@@ ature of the legal protection of the personality would be fear@@ ed . &quot;
the chamber court needs to clear the amount of cash on payments .
the constitutional solution have often been reinforced in the past often the rights of prisoners .
so they said only in April a set of pra@@ ys , because he was incar@@ cer@@ ated in a cell .
human life is estimated to be a decision of 2011 as well as the multi @-@ pin connections of a cell without separate toilet .
in addition they will also confirmed the Berlin constitutional court , of a prisoners in a Parall@@ el in November 2009 .
the then r@@ ack@@ et was opened on three months daily between 15 and 21 hours in such a cell , as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin pr@@ isons were come over the past weeks also due to missing staff into head@@ lines .
prisoners will therefore be included only 23 hours , the ag@@ gression rises , even to b@@ lows , it should be already due to the ten@@ se condition .
after information of the J@@ us@@ tic@@ ulation , 21 offices are not occupied in T@@ egel due to Nach@@ wu@@ chs@@ man@@ es , 19 should 2016 away .
Angela Merkel and the refuge@@ e policy : &quot; we create the &quot;
the immigration of refugees is a tremendous challenge - the Federal Chancell@@ ery is decided to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
around 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany according to the forecast of the Federal Ministry for Germany , following statement by Vi@@ z@@ ek@@ anz@@ ler Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) is Germany even able to record a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) in view of the unusual challenge will demonstrate : &quot; I say again and again : we can create it , and we create it . &quot;
what is coming to Germany gives the following overview .
used in various perspectives between 35@@ 0000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Finance ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) each year - and the next five years are long .
this is almost twice as much as it is built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
dramatic is the lack of living @-@ living room but above all at pay@@ able properties : annual 6@@ 0000 to 8@@ 0000 social housing for the le@@ ase term , and around that particularly favourable apartments will also apply to refugees too .
Federal Minister of Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) will therefore double the promotion of double , from currently 518 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing would have to rise , and that the federal government must invest an encour@@ agement in the amount of 6.4 billion per year .
moreover , scientists and Federal Minister for Invest@@ ors are in fact that there must be more tax benefits for investments in the housing construction .
according to the estimates by the Institute for labour market and vocational research , it is that long @-@ term 55 percent of the refuge@@ e Mountains can be w@@ aged in Germany over the long @-@ term .
however , the refugees in Germany would not be sought after their qualification to help them in getting started by Claudia Walter , Project Management for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
but for the integration of refugees it is crucial if they find jobs in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the entry fee , but also for self @-@ este@@ em of immigration , says mig@@ rant researchers Diet@@ rich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
in Germany it has given to a political direction according to the throne of throne : the work offered for refugees to recognition work .
whilst earlier an employment offered for asylum seek@@ ers was reduced from up to five years , this in November 2014 is reduced to three months , as well as the resi@@ den@@ y of asylum seek@@ ers , the asylum seek@@ ers is limited to a residence .
in the society - also because of the lack of qualified labour - multip@@ ly the viewpoint that refugees should be able to gain access to the labour market .
a major hur@@ d@@ le for access to the labour market are lack of clarity .
up to now there is not yet sufficient knowledge of general and fair @-@ related language courses .
studies also show that jobs most frequently can be convey@@ ed by personal contacts .
the development of networks is therefore a point of view to Thr@@ ust@@ hardt on Königs@@ bau to work integration .
the Berlin School Administration has found that only a few es@@ cap@@ ed parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , estimated at ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the ro@@ oted parents it is only once important to keep the family , &quot; says Il@@ yes Ko@@ sch@@ em@@ bar , Sprecher for youth and family in the Berliner Sen@@ ats@@ management .
to convince the family nevertheless of the advantages of the K@@ ita , spread the administration of manual in different languages .
should the need to increase de@@ men@@ ors through the great number of refugees , the Berlin Sen@@ at would try to increase the training of training - about by increasing more technical colleges .
in the countries students are prepared without a German knowledge of welcome classes in the classes .
but they will not always be taught by fully trained teachers and teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers , who only have a qualification in English as a second language .
in them there is no short@@ age , says Be@@ ate St@@ ability of the Berlin School .
the German Stud@@ enten@@ werk is estimated that some 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
basically no State asylum seek@@ ers or commem@@ or@@ ations the study - the only exception was so far Berlin , Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator Frank H@@ enk@@ el ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned his position now but abandoned .
a member of voluntary refugees could be facilit@@ ated to the university directly .
for refugees with a resp@@ oni@@ ation or tolerance no achievements of asylum seek@@ ers do not get achievements after asylum seek@@ er , if they begin gradu@@ ate studies .
the latter occurs in principle not a BA@@ Fö@@ G , since they fall not under the circle of the eligible persons .
remem@@ bering refugees have had to lived in Germany so far as BA@@ Fö@@ G may have eligible to shor@@ ten this margin on 15 months .
but this financing gap must be closed but , Steffen K@@ RA@@ CH , Berlin@@ s Under@@ secret@@ ary for Science , and the Deutsche Stud@@ enten@@ werk ,
the students should immediately get BA@@ Fö@@ G .
Islam will be part of an important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should therefore clear the same rights as they have the churches and to further develop the existing state @-@ churches to develop their new state religions .
it would also be important to establish a Muslim welfare association , taking care of the new s@@ limmer .
among the rights also duties .
thus the representatives of Islam must agree to a clear contact person , and to cooperate with the state in many fields and to give it certain control possibilities .
this also includes the willingness to fight against religious fundament@@ alism .
the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , iced by Thursday the concern , religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany .
those who wanted to spend such conflicts in Germany , &quot; now have their right to stay here in Germany , he acts , &quot; he said in Bay@@ rische Rund@@ funk .
he proposed to translate the Basic Law on Arab .
integration will be much more today than today a subject of the whole community in the future .
this will also change the multi @-@ term society , the elimination of discrimination and rac@@ ism will be ev@@ oc@@ ative .
Germany has indeed a result of European decisions - a decade of anti @-@ discrimination and a general gender equality law .
but it is learning quite slow as the NS@@ U @-@ M@@ ord@@ work showed , in the police and authorities the rac@@ ist moti@@ ve has been systematically opposed .
equal opportunities for all : what mig@@ ran@@ s organizations and stakeholders of non @-@ white German have for too long and will commit themselves to international conventions such as anti @-@ ass@@ is@@ cop@@ ation@@ ism Germany , if the country remains peaceful and to use its new citizens - for the benefit of all .
generally , Germany insur@@ able which previously hop@@ ed to supply refugees medical , and sp@@ ice by Frank Ulrich Montgomery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what Man@@ - Power and capacity applies , we create the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tages@@ spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , they must have extra money into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Parker , all com@@ ers is equal to the registration of health Cards .
services could be dis@@ counted later with the Bundes@@ Bundesländer .
in the long @-@ term , it was highly question@@ able to get so many people with the limited service catalogue , which see the asylum seek@@ er .
otherwise , doctors are making the doctors particularly to create a language .
already before , so , the Berlin health scientists in The@@ a Bor@@ de were proven that migrants are worse than their diseases than other patients .
not only in clinics , also in medical practice would have to be assumed for interpre@@ ter .
it would be helped many refugees but also with more general medical practi@@ tion@@ ers in the emergency @-@ out @-@ patient .
and with another diagnostic view .
under refuge@@ e camps around , there are clearly more un@@ treated disabilities , and among young people it is about HIV @-@ clari@@ fication .
with the partial different pa@@ ences c@@ eb@@ ed German doctors made by their education , but clearly , said Harris .
&quot; equilibrium or Tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not so hard to recognize , &quot; and what the trouble of tem@@ angel is concerned , be it through the refugees and even all@@ evi@@ ation in sight .
the Syri@@ ans have had a high @-@ developed educational system , which may be even doctors .
to be practic@@ able , however , they would have to follow their qualifications and re@@ en@@ tically once again exam@@ ining .
at least half of the refugees in Germany ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) psych@@ ic acid ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) psych@@ ic acid : most of them suffer from a post trau@@ matic loads or among depression .
particularly vulnerable , refuge@@ e binder , explains Diet@@ rich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent published study of the TU München demonstrates that every fifth refuge@@ e refuge@@ e mo@@ ur@@ ation has been trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
those who is in a post trau@@ matic loads weighing is , suff@@ ers among others at the so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with resp@@ ir@@ atory , g@@ win@@ del , cardi@@ ac and death .
further symptoms are sleeping and concentr@@ ations . , strong per@@ mis@@ sible and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
to prevent that symptoms would be chronic , be an early treatment necessary , explained Mun@@ z .
however , only four percent of the psych@@ ic k@@ ran@@ ial refugees receive a psych@@ otherapy .
although , psych@@ ic k@@ ran@@ ke asylum seek@@ ers can put an application for a psych@@ otherapy , but does the treatment usually take several months .
moreover , in the social offices mostly in Sach@@ ers or doctors that are not trained for the mental illness do not decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Zim@@ bab@@ a Robert M@@ ug@@ abe will keep the wrong address in the parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr M@@ ug@@ abe , Africa For@@ t@@ ester guide , fell down the stairs in the beginning of the year from a podium .
he was in@@ ju@@ red , but the video of the case quickly became popular about the social media .
the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament &apos;s opening also was d@@ ined by MEPs from the opposition to preserve it and war@@ ned that they were war@@ ned by Mr M@@ ug@@ abe and accompany them before the address of Mr M@@ ug@@ abe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month she had expanded him and interrupted for him during his speech on the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he returns on Tuesday .

H@@ ew@@ let@@ t @-@ Pack@@ ard is up to 30,@@ 000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ let@@ t @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build 25.@@ 000 to 30,@@ 000 positions within the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP will become later this year in two listed companies and separate the computer and printer from its fast growing company @-@ hardware and service activities .
the expected job super@@ structure leads to a burden of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , and said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this restructuring measures will make a competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ let@@ t @-@ package enterprise &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ chair and Chief Executive , which should guide the unity according to the separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ let@@ t Pack@@ ard Enterprise becomes smaller and stronger focus than it is HP today and we have a wide and deep portfolio of shops that support companies when going to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as a independent company , we are better placed closer than ever before to satisfy the needs of our clients all over the world .
H@@ ew@@ let@@ t Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion $ annual turnover and is focused on delivering un@@ reachable technology solutions for companies , &quot; such as an explanation of the company .
it is granted a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30@@ s by gradu@@ ates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ let@@ t and Dave Pack@@ ard was formed to manufacture electric plants and whose Pal@@ o Alto garage is called &apos; the birth@@ place of Sili@@ con Valley . &quot;
HP has a massive restructuring to tackle the conversion of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the worldwide two @-@ largest PC producers and one of the biggest U.S. technology companies , is the latest in this area , based on conviction that closely foc@@ uss@@ ed companies on creating a better performance .
FC ar@@ senal @-@ captain Mik@@ hail Art@@ eta says that team coll@@ ars front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb , behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
they emphas@@ ised compared to Wil@@ sh@@ i , that there was only September and provided his rehabilitation after Plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario is already that Wil@@ sh@@ ers certainly means at least the next four games for England and certainly given its participation in the next summer on the European Championship and certainly un@@ certain .
the big shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ i had ended the last season after a separate Kn@@ u@@ ckl@@ ing , and then returned to his old momentum during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury is threat@@ ening the career , &quot; says W@@ enger .
it is a bones that does not healing .
this is not a major matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his ank@@ le or with the inj@@ uries that he had previously .
this may be true from purely medical view , but like W@@ enger also recognized , there is the associated danger of other bre@@ aches , always when a player tried to return in the middle of the season .
it is also developed a uncomfortable pattern .
the study of Premier In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has sold 23 different disorders of Wil@@ sh@@ i since his de@@ but six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of Ar@@ sen@@ als 157 Lig@@ pi@@ iel@@ en in the last five game times .
the wider image for ar@@ senal is that they have been in six of eight games times since 2007 / 08 of the two Premier League Clubs who have completed most acc@@ us@@ ation .
W@@ enger accepts the potential of a Teu@@ fel@@ i@@ ac , but ar@@ senal believes that an improvement in the danger rate during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , if you come from an injury , you have a random period , a time in which you will strengthen your body and mar@@ tial power , &quot; said W@@ enger .
Jack is young enough to overcome it .
I hope , his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will run a career of the way he deserves .
ar@@ senal starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of games on Saturday and against T@@ ott@@ enh@@ am Hot@@ sp@@ ur in the coming Wednesday , and W@@ enger inv@@ ade itself a rotation inside the team .
Hé@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelled to Croatia , which means that Ma@@ th@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ uch@@ y and Art@@ eta are starting .
W@@ enger can also start with Ki@@ eb@@ ed Gi@@ b@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Re@@ o Mon@@ real and The@@ o Wal@@ c@@ ott .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and the players who need it , a small break @-@ up , &quot; said W@@ enger .
although ar@@ senal clear favorites are , by group F to return , the Mak@@ si@@ mir @-@ St@@ adion in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest intim@@ id@@ ation in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also gone to 41 games after the &quot; Un@@ defe@@ ated &quot; campaign was started in the last season .
the st@@ adium was created on Tuesday evening by an earthquake , but measured on the Ri@@ chter@@ sk@@ ala .
this year it was the 10th of Zagreb .
W@@ enger is the opinion that ar@@ senal has drawn the doctrine of the past season with the Champions League against Monaco and remains committed to the distant hope with his management to the association for his first Europ@@ ap@@ ok@@ al tri@@ umph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said W@@ enger .
it has never worked with ar@@ senal .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not a dre@@ amer .
friendly feast : the com@@ edy @-@ show that provided us serious lessons by men .
the absence of similar represent@@ ations in shows are evident , especially with regard to how the need for men to open , now even more des@@ per@@ ate than ever before , how self @-@ record rates among young men at a 15 year yo@@ ke .
in 2013 it was the most important death for men at the age of 20 to 45 in Britain , and it remains more common in men than with women .
in trying to address the issue , announced the camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ly Living Mis@@ er@@ back ( CA@@ LM - campaign against a her@@ edit@@ ary life ) in 2015 , as the year of man , with the aim of asking the culture to ask for help when they need this .
friendship is the heart of the fight to master this challenge .
a recent study with more than 2.000 high school students , with de@@ pressed men@@ op@@ ause , that if the suff@@ erer gave a sufficient high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood &quot; had its chances of recovery .
for those who are not de@@ press@@ ants , hal@@ ved a circle of spirit@@ ually healthy friends the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have only made friends to make a friendship .
in the Age of social media guided communication , with its focus on style over substance is the im@@ ign@@ ity of the answer often more important than a significant contact .
our digital life have the need to appear strong , vital , and successful , even if in reality the isolation is dominated .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by the domin@@ ance , what psychologists &apos;s extr@@ enh@@ ic values indicate ; money , image , social status , everything to cost intr@@ in@@ ic values - our inner long@@ ing for personal development and friendship , which affects our mental health much deeper .
and as a video @-@ play invent@@ ors and Milli@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy .
the Beautiful at Friends was that this foc@@ uss@@ ing on the head was put .
each character was not defined by his work but by his personality , which gli@@ stering by interaction as friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent h@@ ugs , Mom@@ ents in the so@@ cc@@ er so@@ cks and the long@@ ing of Ros@@ s to Rach@@ el - all that came out of the knowledge that men can definitely be heard , even though they often res@@ ound up their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a staff of the phone @-@ care I stated : ... &quot; my attri@@ bute to people who are de@@ pressed to de@@ pressed and sel@@ ections to me how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the males who contact us feel often not able to speak with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I comm@@ end &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I comm@@ end &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a tremendous impact as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness if you talk about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Friends is one of the shows that comes to me in the sense if I try to offer long @-@ term residents .
it presents quite clearly the small moments of men .
so much my objective out@@ set status via the phone the people in moments of des@@ pair can also help the long term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so if you visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Festival with the celebration of the day to visit completely newly established back@@ drop , why do not take your friends to have a drink at Central Per@@ k .
or even better if you can see in Star@@ bu@@ cks anyone alone , give him a smile and tell him hello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends is sent on com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - the whole 236 ep@@ iso@@ des - for # Friend@@ s@@ Festival
di Maria meet to help you cr@@ ying on Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celeb@@ rates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ ui@@ di and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hits on Malm@@ ö .
di Mary met his de@@ but in the Champions League on Tuesday and will help to watch on Malm@@ ö .
here are the Report and reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held a course as Paris Saint @-@ Germain his Champions League season with a extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ par@@ st@@ st@@ adium on Tuesday started .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ut as a player who brought the French Master towards the way , but after they susp@@ ended them a number of occasions before they finally achieved their aw@@ pl@@ unge , as Cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1st minute a head .
with Real Madrid and Ver@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k , also in group A needed Paris a strong start against the Swedish Masters , as it is not only the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they came the points , there was no class @-@ game by Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovi@@ cs missed od@@ ds in front of his home @-@ Team and against the association , with whom he began his illustr@@ ated career in 1999 .
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or to win over the Champions League . therefore it &apos;s a good start to create our enemies issues and let loose spray , even if there is certain things we need to be perf@@ ected in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we have not yet scor@@ ed one or two more goals . &quot;
I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic returned after its violation of three changes in the Paris team , which could last on weekends a 2 : 2 un@@ decided on their own place against Bordeaux in the first League , but he was spread in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ inian wing pi@@ erc@@ er was referred to as the man , which was th@@ ink@@ able to take over the next month of Manchester United States , and he pointed out why , when he ran in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense , before he turned to Joh@@ an W@@ iland over beautiful in the long corner of the network .
if anyone believed that PSG I would succeed in a great victory which was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , the Cel@@ tic set in a play @-@ off to reach this level , joined in An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was called a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the field @-@ field .
but besides one shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , which is far from Kevin Tr@@ yp P@@ fo@@ sten at the 34@@ th minute mer@@ ges her little in the attack .
instead , there were suggestions on , with some mis@@ hes and poor deals , not least because of I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , which was in no less than five attempts alone in the first half of p@@ sy , and then left , after Cav@@ ani he had started after rest@@ art .
nevertheless he pointed much more skill , when he brought his fellow @-@ players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , the Di Maria had turned into a fil@@ ming , which was made of terri@@ fic in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the fo@@ oth@@ brush ...
the second gate was finally shortly after the hour brand thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Uruguay is achieved with its sixth summer season , after I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic a left side of Max@@ well was f@@ ished .
this ended all thoughts on that Malm@@ ö to come back in the game could come back , and only an excellent addition of W@@ iland from the short@@ est distance to David Lu@@ iz could hold down low before sub@@ players E@@ ze@@ qui@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi has been detected at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ eide , gave later to see a class about his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year .
since then , we have played only in the Swedish League that did not have the same level .
the qualifying games are not rich out . &quot;
hat from Paris !
it was a great game of them !

Det@@ ro@@ it tiger is over to Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ id past
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ OL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny to the Det@@ ro@@ it Tig@@ ers .
earlier they once were one of the best teams in the bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League Central .
however , the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as Sp@@ o@@ iler , playing this part on Tuesday , but on Tuesday , against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ ino with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field .
the bor@@ rowing a chance for Asc@@ ension in a game of Houston , Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card @-@ Platz .
for Det@@ ro@@ it , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that has been so hard to grasp about a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all vic@@ t@@ ories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad th@@ m .
Tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Am@@ fre@@ do Simon held its early @-@ off@@ ensive support , when Det@@ ro@@ it d@@ otted three times in the first two inside , then once in the sixth and then once in the nin@@ th .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) , 6 times cut off in 1 / 3 Internal : and for three run@@ ners .
it was only his third start in his last nine game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bul@@ l@@ pen every game , and therefore I want to concentrate entirely in the game .
the design@@ ate Tiger @-@ lat@@ tice Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ranks , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit song by Mart@@ ine@@ z since then he had four hits to the Seattle of Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has good wit@@ ch &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good for a stroke training ) , looked much better at the Bul@@ l@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three rings in the hinter@@ land at the end of seventh inner@@ ings , the band had their best chance to go back into play .
center F@@ iel@@ der B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left dirt road .
right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a b@@ unt , and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ ors to the stri@@ pe before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Hard@@ y .
Hard@@ y sur@@ ran wall , the only man , with whom he has faced , prior to the rect@@ ed R@@ ookie of Miguel S@@ ano , who to@@ oth@@ set to the rect@@ ory Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen a two @-@ Run .
with a pair of runner and the conclusion @-@ Run at the second brought the Third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ps to a Double Play .
it was the major in the Major League leading 27 times in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ps is a Double Play
after Det@@ ro@@ it added to Det@@ ro@@ it at the end of the ne@@ below for Insurance , the wall is an R@@ BI @-@ double against the Cl@@ os@@ er of the Tig@@ ers Bru@@ ce Ron@@ don and recorded the state of 5 @-@ 4 .
but the legal fr@@ aces l@@ ach are S@@ ano for three pitches for its fifth .
Det@@ ro@@ it benef@@ itted to the pr@@ el@@ ude of the game by an even not moving Phi@@ l H@@ ug@@ hes .
the Tig@@ ers scor@@ ed three rings in the first two inside and was veter@@ an before the play of the danger of inj@@ uries was chosen since he was missing because of a back in more than one month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ ug@@ hes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I felt myself , when I put down and notice that I would create some pretty good pitches for the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after they received the first Le@@ ad Bat@@ ter , Hus@@ sein gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z brought into play by a single &quot; up the Middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z created his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the run@@ ners in the scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman N@@ ick Castell@@ anos followed by a single on the right side , got another Run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown from the game , when he tried to get to the third , what the threat ended .
the Tig@@ ers laid on the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a great shock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ ino @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not take great be@@ aten but he has the right place to know .
H@@ ug@@ hes was found in a Pit@@ ch state , no points scor@@ ed in the third mind , before he was replaced by the rel@@ ie@@ ver A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .

Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria
the director of the Münch@@ ner Safety Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that &apos;s why I cannot take place on military action options without Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he cast the European states of the collective displ@@ ac@@ ement . &quot;
four years ago , it was glad that the ch@@ ali@@ ce of a military participation in Germany was gone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict is scr@@ ut@@ iny before our front door , &quot; he said in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the EU &apos;s interior ministers want to take a new meeting on the binding distribution of further 120 000 refugees during the upcoming Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
in view of the strong refuge@@ e war in Germany the federal government wants to support the countries with the initial listing and distribution of people .
in cooperation with the countries , Merkel will bring together with the countries , announced Merkel a late beginning to almost vi@@ bran@@ t consultations with the Prime Minister in the ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ ation office in Berlin .

Rome now has a Martin @-@ Lu@@ ther @-@ Platz
almost 500 years after the Re@@ formation , there is now a Martin @-@ Lu@@ ther place in Rome .
in the presence of city @-@ President Ig@@ na@@ zio Marino was bap@@ tised on Wednesday a far @-@ known place in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill on the names of the German Reform@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is now called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ ans of the Re@@ formation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park lies in the middle of the old Rome next to the Colos@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the work of the ev@@ angel@@ ic churches in Rome .
J@@ ens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , parish of the Lutheran Church in Rome , rec@@ alled on Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es over centuries were often only in sec@@ rec@@ y of their faith .
this place become visible in symbo@@ lic way that their tradition of the Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Lu@@ ther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) presented themselves as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k in the year 1999 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he took the city at that time as a comm@@ ented sin@@ ner .
his negative impressions thir@@ sty his view of histori@@ ans in his later fight against Rome .

hammer artists inv@@ ests three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( g@@ ild@@ ed ) Dor@@ n@@ enk@@ rone is one of the main plants , the Ot@@ mar Old for his Scrip@@ tures has painted .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and b@@ agu@@ ed tex@@ te .
at the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ old Bible , which has now been published with amazing pictures .
at the beginning the picture was formulated for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his very personal inter@@ pret@@ ations of bi@@ b@@ lical stories on paper and canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and fant@@ asi@@ ve forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but is not syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; images . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary , the respective topics can be adjusted , which can quite be quite sh@@ ü@@ ster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; around three years ago Ot@@ mar has worked in his Bible project for which he has made a subjective artistic selection from the many topics of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; book of all books &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
created , cycles , which devote themselves topics like Cr@@ ash , pl@@ agues , commandments or pat@@ ernity .
in this way he has fascinated ane@@ ously , several partners : this applies to the Lu@@ ther @-@ Verlag with his the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publisher with his emphasis on art@@ tion@@ aries .
and there is especially the author of Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , which deals on the basis of painting with the respective Bible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has interpreted the art of Ot@@ mar to the selected fac@@ ulty , and translated into the Today , into current co@@ her@@ encies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are as ver@@ bal mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
immersed them among the original scrip@@ tures of Martin Lu@@ ther and each one of the artist who formulated his very personal thoughts for the particular situation .
the jewelry Coll@@ ar has golden letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old must be twice a deep insight into his soul , its emotions .
this is a high level of intimacy .
emotions were ultimately all the trigger for the Bible @-@ Project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in Wern@@ ig@@ ero@@ de and grown in Berlin , comes from a family that belong to the strict Protest@@ ant Moravian Or@@ ders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the education was already being with the Rohr@@ stock , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Ot@@ mar Old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to do this , perhaps to bring me back to the Lord again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to be more significance in terms of art in quick@@ time : &quot; the perception of imag@@ ining is still dominated by complaints , and which is loud .
symbol@@ ism is being condem@@ ned .
artists have another desire and w@@ onne , things to show .
images always have something mys@@ tical and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect I am a dinos@@ aur@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar am I want to let the viewer in the pictures &apos; s , let them seem , discover and feel that power they have : &quot; the image is looking for its counter@@ ing . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost and on Tuesday during the presentation of Ot@@ mar @-@ old @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; has always been &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art : &quot; I like it as he is att@@ ained with his works . &quot;
old did not notice how the Bible has fully grasp the Bible , but that is selected for him important , also mysterious themes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was not a collaboration on eye @-@ level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says M@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text explains &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; formed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Bible . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider the greatest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there can no one say in principle that I don &apos;t matter , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be interested in this topic for each individual , this topic under the control , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B @-@ Chief Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the so@@ cc@@ er might help you .
but the decisive turn@@ outs must face the politics .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help , where and how they can only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lever@@ Office Fur@@ di Fi@@ ler &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; image &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Tuesday ) and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Self @-@ Action Plan &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refuge@@ e dr@@ ama goes every way , not everyone should be able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

at Bor@@ ussia Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eb@@ ack of Marco Re@@ us in the first group@@ ment of the Europe League .
the nation@@ als will be missing the sp@@ ector of the so@@ cc@@ er Bundes@@ l@@ iga as well as in du@@ el with the F@@ K . on Thursday ( 07 : 00 pm / Sky ) are missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot draw on him unfortunately , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether to be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ l@@ iga @-@ Top@@ play against Lever@@ k@@ usen , the B@@ VB Coach open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
given the high load of its pro@@ s , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change his st@@ alls on the Re@@ us position .
so he announced a change on the go@@ ali@@ @-@ position .
therefore the Roman Wei@@ den@@ ial is given the place of tri@@ ke@@ eper novel @-@ ki .
&quot; he trained on a absolute top level , &quot; pra@@ ised the football teacher the World Champion .
whether past@@ ries in the future in all the Europe @-@ League game comes to use , Tu@@ ch@@ el left open .
with high prob@@ ability he will also have the second participation .
the for@@ warding statement of fellow @-@ players Re@@ us that the Fin@@ als for the B@@ VB in Europe League will be the destination , holds mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l for fully understand@@ able : &quot; that makes Marco not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to access the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rob@@ oter@@ cars : government aims at the cutting edge for Germany
Germany shall be at the end of the federal government on the shift of the cars of technological technological .
the Bundes@@ kab@@ in@@ ett decided on Wednesday a Strateg@@ i@@ ap@@ eritif in the house of traffic b@@ ini@@ ster Alexander Dobr@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which shows for example investment in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dobr@@ ind@@ t &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spoke on Wednesday at Frankfurt on the edge of the Autom@@ esse I@@ AA of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobile age &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
automated and connected @-@ connected , will increase the road safety and ensure less steel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dobr@@ ind@@ t &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wants to discuss the topic with his ministers from the G@@ 7 countries that come together with representatives of the industry on I@@ AA .
the Strateg@@ i@@ ap@@ eritif of the traffic of traffic is stressed among other things the importance of mobile broad@@ band installation and a high level of revenue on digital radio .
at the testing of new technique is currently a test circuit on the highway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional limitation has to be short@@ ened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will examine the Federal Government to verify the legal parameters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary to adapt to the new developments &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , Germany wants to ap@@ point itself internationally for making the possible peak speed for self @-@ driving cars from 10 to 130 levels of kilometers .
the Federal Government also wants to stand up for a change of the Vienna Convention which has so far seen for the human being as a driver so far .
when driving , when driving , the car takes you the guidance , the driver will become more and more for passenger .
the technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data within an individual .
following a study of the contest , which will be high @-@ based driving on high@@ ways to 2020 technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , driving vehicles on public roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only far to 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value creation in the area of driver assistance systems and the high @-@ automated driving functions at the location of Germany appreciate the authors of the study by 2025 on about 8,@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital conn@@ ectivity of the car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road transport , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD @-@ announc@@ ements S@@ ör@@ en Bart@@ ol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the issue of liability in inci@@ dents and the security of the personal data of the driver must be clear .
even the German self @-@ driving cars are however skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
an on Wednesday at the AA presented survey of the For@@ mer company on behalf of the test for@@ eg@@ li@@ zation DE@@ KRA comes to the result , that only eight percent of the Germans believe that their autonom@@ ous cars will count on the next ten years , 32 percent count only in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe in it at all .
in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents must be expected by 2025 with aut@@ on@@ oun vehicles , in the USA 33 percent .
anyway the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to leave completely on a self @-@ driving vehicle .
after a survey of the dig@@ ital@@ ist Bit@@ kom only seven percent will agree , take control over the entire trip on all roads .
on the highway could imagine that in flowing traffic together 15 percent , at the St@@ au 45 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well every fourth party , the car would not leave the car under no circumstances . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for a en@@ ant H@@ enny
it is a mixture of very large Mo@@ den@@ schau and a wax gl@@ aze fir@@ es : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich to show an exhibition about his works .
the highlights : man@@ nequ@@ ins , which were shot thanks to video @-@ proj@@ ections .
you bear the spectacular creations of the French designers , which became among other things with Mad@@ onn@@ as Bü@@ hn@@ en@@ out@@ fits to the big star of the female scene - and with it that he put men in skirts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the en@@ ant of the Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier it was very easy , in the meantime it is real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk , ( V@@ om Ci@@ tiz@@ ens@@ ky on the cat@@ walk ) , which is seen from September 18 at the Kuns@@ thalle the hyp@@ o @-@ Kulturstiftung , it is a luck that the mo@@ des@@ ch@@ opp@@ ers has changed its beginning position on a show over his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually , he had been on the other , for : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me the show me even a bit after death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously made in the Canadian Montreal and in Paris station .
&quot; it is so much more than just beautiful dres@@ ses , &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren .
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits put an insight into this not yet at the bli@@ ck@@ ly work of the man , the mo@@ dem@@ ons , without ever have an education to have completed .
chron@@ ologically is not built , but it is a beautifully chore@@ ography overall work , for which much effort was operated : around the doll@@ s , was committed to the example of a Sty@@ list .
14 tons of material have established the cre@@ ators according to details of the Kur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
shortly before the start of the Okto@@ ber@@ fest was still a special shot at : a leather h@@ osen @-@ out@@ fit with cor@@ set@@ t .
Heidi meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are lighter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ ti@@ ers old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
he is designed for the first , tender mo@@ edi@@ c to the design of the designers .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he was attracted to his t@@ ed@@ dy B@@ HS and dres@@ ses , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
playing with a d@@ oll , his parents were not allowed to him .
that design of fashion he took us later .
he sto@@ le against mo@@ dem@@ ics and looked at the dra@@ fts of other designers , such as Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
later I then bought it .
for his first own fashion show , he can not pay the mod@@ eling .
they got nothing , were allowed to keep the clothes ...
jewelry instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener tip as mode @-@ niche
earlier it went to the long embro@@ ider@@ y machines in and around Pl@@ auen to make feet .
the embro@@ ider@@ y fabrics and tips emerged in a large amount of customers , which they ar@@ isen , for example to de@@ co@@ es and she@@ er curtains .
this alone works today no longer , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of Mo@@ des@@ p@@ ie Pl@@ auen .
instead it is fashion again .
in the initial time of the Pl@@ au@@ ener tip , mode has been a major role , then used by the textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as n@@ ical re@@ discovered .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : head in jewelry , with accessories such as po@@ ckets and in regional tra@@ ys .
at all the so @-@ called vintage mode , which rests on past styl@@ istic periods , a growing potential for damage .
those who has operated in the textile industry in Germany is no longer served on the market .
with us they are already half of all orders .
Mo@@ des@@ p@@ ie Pl@@ auen is together with nine other companies member in the sector of industry , Pl@@ au@@ ener tip and embro@@ ider@@ ies .
only they are allowed to bear the protected label .
over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of its sales are broken .
private technical shops and also the wholes@@ ale there are almost no more .
our products achieve the customers on this path not yet .
the mass ware wants to be much cheaper in the Asian region and is almost sold exclusively through chains .
furthermore , we@@ aker of the export , currently to Russia and the US .
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association is also tried to score points such as Cord@@ ula Bauer by the embro@@ ider@@ y in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since this year , we introduce a seal of quality that shows that we manufacture ecological and socially balanced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt compl@@ emented by : &quot; this is also related to the used materials . &quot;
diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt taught at the Snow@@ eberger Ob@@ enst@@ al of the West@@ s@@ ächs@@ isches University Z@@ wick@@ au - at the fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in embro@@ ider@@ ies and tips .
in order to find out the competition from the Asian region something must find quality and innovative products .
you need time and courage .
it creates a tension between the fres@@ h@@ est ideas of the designer and the factories , who need to think above all economically . &quot;
therefore , an existing design is often only slightly m@@ ated to keep a customer size .
a couple of years ago bust@@ ling textile design of Kat@@ i Re@@ uter the historic snow @-@ top .
sti@@ cking the machine to some places of small ch@@ ats .
the Pl@@ au@@ ener gol@@ d@@ ric@@ ants in Bianca * * * * * * * * * * * * * I was able to start with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze . &quot;
now they use the snow@@ y tip for their jewelry .
in an elabor@@ ate process it shaped the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people of the region identify with the subject of Pl@@ au@@ ener tip - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter .
she also supplies in the USA , to Australia and Finland - especially to customers who lived in Pl@@ auen and surroundings and who like to have a reminder .
I view my jew@@ ellery as a modern Ambassador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze .

XI ur@@ ges the economy to open the economy wider for the world
the economy needs to be wider broader public to promote growth , President Xi Jing@@ ping at the Tuesday of a group that was charged with the ste@@ ering reform of the reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should stand out to improve foreign investments and know @-@ how and to improve strategies for business @-@ ups &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said in an address in the 16th session of the Central leadership for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new start @-@ ups and advance reforms will boost new momentum and v@@ itality and provide new place for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot;
the executive Group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a neg@@ ativity listing , including a negative key list , relaxation of the border controls , health promotion ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the residents @-@ milking system .
following statement , a negative list will be created , the sectors and companies identified to have not come into question for investments .
the system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of importance because it provides a greater role in the ap@@ oration of resources , a legally binding business environment and designed the market open , said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the government is also controls over the transferred to the companies of the deleg@@ ates and ensure that companies decide how they manage their stores .
the statement also said that China border @-@ border reserves the border , new models of cross border @-@ border cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth .
in the framework of a offerings , state @-@ controlled sectors will open more areas for private investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legal interests of outside companies , and better services to them , &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , it is easier for foreigners , to apply a permanent residence permit , or the &quot; Green Card &quot; to apply the requirements and the application process might be facilit@@ ated .
the right of law@@ yers to guarantee their job practice , and professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .

EU wants to double @-@ du@@ mp@@ its limits in rob@@ ber@@ y bor@@ du@@ cks
the European Commission wants to double the thres@@ hing limits for Mercury in large rob@@ ber@@ y and the consumers thus significantly higher dos@@ es of ner@@ ve .
consumer organisation Food@@ watch , which pre@@ ci@@ zed the plans of the EU , cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed the plans , &quot; risks and side @-@ effects ex@@ propri@@ etary industrial and environmental policy , with full of requests to pregnant and inf@@ ants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t of Food@@ watch .
Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t is supposed to be the limit values of the Ner@@ ven@@ gi@@ es for large fish at the end of the food chain such as Hai@@ tian or w@@ aver@@ ing for &quot; economic reasons , &quot; from one to two mill@@ ig@@ ram Mercury for the k@@ ilo@@ grams .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; big smo@@ kers should be so strongly opp@@ y with Mercury on the basis of the current thres@@ hold about 50 percent of the length . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after dou@@ bling of the limits , only 14.5 percent are not negoti@@ able .
in return for this lo@@ os@@ ening , the EU considers the limit values to another fish of currently 0,5 Mill@@ ig@@ r@@ amm at 0,1 Mill@@ ig@@ r@@ amm of 0.1 Mill@@ ig@@ r@@ amm pro k@@ ilo@@ grams .
food@@ watch str@@ ing@@ ed this but as &quot; tri@@ ck , &quot; because smaller peac@@ eke@@ ep@@ ers , like some car@@ p are usually not so low , they are the planned flo@@ ods already today .
the avo@@ idance at Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &apos; a per@@ fi@@ des distr@@ acting , which helps the economy alone &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mercury is a powerful focus for man high @-@ tox@@ ic sword , which affects the food chain in above all in rob@@ ber@@ y@@ fish .
the federal government therefore war@@ ns that &quot; already small quantities can result in dis@@ inf@@ ants of the nervous system . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Ministry of Conformity Statements to its homepage with regard to the valid high@@ s , but that an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health haz@@ ard is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
