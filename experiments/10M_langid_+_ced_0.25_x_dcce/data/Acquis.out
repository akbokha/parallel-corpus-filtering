II ) the protection of industrial powers and other the insp@@ ections of the organization to be aware of the confidential information is ensured .
&quot; each State is aimed at the organisation , including their assets , means , and funds , as well as their insp@@ ectors and other officials , the responsibilities of the agreement on the rights and liber@@ ations of the International At@@ omen@@ energy organisation . &quot;
&quot; the backup measures after this Convention shall be termin@@ ated in relation to core material , when the community and the organisation declare that the material is consumed or in a way that it has been used for a nuclear activity , which is no longer usable or virtually un@@ avo@@ idable . &quot;
the community noti@@ fied the organisation following the transfer of this convention on the passing of nuclear material from the states that is subject to the backup measures following this Convention .
&quot; the backup measures after this Convention shall be termin@@ ated in relation to core material , as soon as the recipient state , as in this Convention shall be assumed . &quot;
&quot; the organisation carries documents , each passing on and if necessary the re@@ application of the backup measures will emerge on the continuing core material . &quot;
&quot; the nuclear material is to be subject to nuclear power , such as the manufacture of allo@@ ys or ceramics , used in non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the manufacture of allo@@ ys or ceramics , so agreed the community with the organisation of such use of the material , under which circumstances the backup measures can be completed in terms of this material . &quot;
II ) that the cand@@ y material may not be used during the duration of the non @-@ application measures after this Convention not to the production of nuclear weapons and other core compounds .
&quot; ( B ) The organisation and the community meet a regulation that which in this Convention may be applied only as long as the core material used in such activity . &quot;
&quot; in the regulation as far as possible , how long and under what circumstances these backup measures will not be applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the backup is once again used in this Convention as soon as the core material is once again led to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
the organization will be over the total and the composition of this in the concerned state or the question of such material from this state or these countries are held on the ongoing basis .
&quot; this explains its consent as quickly as possible ; it extends only to matters as possible , but it does not extend a tr@@ ash or imp@@ lied knowledge of the military activity , but also does not refer to the following use of the material material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the states bear the cost , which each of them grow in the implementation of their respective obligations arising from this Convention . &quot;
&quot; arise by the community , the states or individuals who are subject to their territory , however , as a result of particular accompl@@ ishment of the organization , so the organization rei@@ m@@ bur@@ sed the costs , provided that they have en@@ closed ahead in advance . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organisation bears the cost of all additional measurements and pro@@ ben@@ ah@@ men that will be demanded by the insp@@ ectors of the organization . &quot;
