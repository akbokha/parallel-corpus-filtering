&quot; this document is a summary of the European Public Opinion report ( EP@@ AR ) , in which explains how the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ ta ( CH@@ MP ) has been judged to see recommendations regarding the use of the drug . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the pack carrier ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or a pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of mel@@ ting tablets , as solution to inser@@ tion ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an inj@@ ection @-@ solution ( 7,5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. wir@@ res thoughts and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or to@@ es of things that are not present ) , distr@@ ust and del@@ usions ; • Bi@@ polar disorder , in which patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods an@@ or@@ m@@ aler high @-@ tuning ) altern@@ ately with periods of regular mood . &quot;
&quot; A@@ bili@@ fy will be used for the treatment of serious to heavy man@@ ic episodes and the prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed in the past on the drug . &quot;
inj@@ ection solution will be applied to a fast control of gest@@ ure un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disorder when the oral intake of drug is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution can take a solution or the mel@@ ting tum@@ or in patients may be applied to the g@@ low of tablets difficulties . &quot;
&quot; in patients , at the same time other medicines are taking place the same as A@@ bili@@ fy , the dosage should be adjusted by A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , i.e. chemical substances that allow communication of ner@@ ve cells to each other . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l probably appears mainly as &quot; partial ag@@ on@@ ist &quot; for the recep@@ tors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydr@@ o @-@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( also ser@@ otonin ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in less measures than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter affects the recep@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydr@@ o tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin with schi@@ z@@ ophr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder played a role to norm@@ alize Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , causing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and prevent their re @-@ occur . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy , the re @-@ emergence of the symptoms , was examined in three studies over up to one year . &quot;
the effectiveness of inj@@ ection @-@ solution was compared in two studies at 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophr@@ enia or similar diseases that compared to a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy over twelve weeks of 347 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the eff@@ ic@@ ation of A@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo , which have been stabil@@ ised to 160 patients , in which the man@@ ic symptoms have already been stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy inj@@ ection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that suffered by Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
&quot; in all studies , the change in patients was examined by a standard sk@@ ala for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the company also led studies to investigate the body the mel@@ ting tum@@ or and the solution to use . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies with the inj@@ ection solution showed patients , the A@@ bili@@ fy in cans of 5,@@ 25 mg , 75 mg or 15 mg received , a significant reduction in symptoms gest@@ ed un@@ rest than the patients who received a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder reduced A@@ bili@@ fy in four of the five short @-@ term studies of more effective than plac@@ ebo .
&quot; A@@ bili@@ fy is also more effective up to 74 weeks of more effective than plac@@ ebo , the re @-@ occur@@ rence of Man@@ ian episodes in previously treated patients and if it was added to an existing treatment . &quot;
&quot; A@@ bili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg @-@ cans , also decreased effectively as plac@@ ebo the symptoms gest@@ ed un@@ rest and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy to take ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are ex@@ tr@@ ap@@ y@@ ram@@ id@@ ale disorders , head@@ ache ( twi@@ light ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion ( increased memory ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , o@@ hel@@ pless@@ ness , In@@ som@@ nia , In@@ som@@ nia ( sleep dysfunction ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ az@@ ate ( CH@@ MP ) suffered at the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophr@@ enia and of medium to severe man@@ ic episode in patients , which had pre@@ domin@@ antly di@@ ary episodes on treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l said to over@@ weig@@ h the risks . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Committee came to the result that the benefits of inj@@ ection solution in the fast control of gest@@ ures and behavi@@ our@@ al disorder in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophr@@ enia or in patients with man@@ ian episodes at Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if an oral therapy is not suitable to over@@ weig@@ h the risks . &quot;
June 2004 the European Commission opened the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharm@@ ac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . a licence for the transport of A@@ bili@@ fy in the whole European Union .
AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y is prescribed for treatment of moderate to heavy man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar disorder in patients who had mostly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l said ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended An@@ de@@ press@@ osis for AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a refresh@@ ing dose of 15 mg / day independently of the meals .
&quot; a gest@@ ed effectiveness of dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
the recommended An@@ de@@ press@@ osis for AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as a mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients &gt; 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initi@@ ald@@ osis should be considered , if clinical factors justi@@ fy this ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ duc@@ tor is set out of the combination therapy should be reduced the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l dose to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; the appearance of su@@ person@@ alised behaviour is among psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders , and in some cases reported after the beginning or after change an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
results of a ep@@ idemi@@ ological study revealed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder does not have raised Su@@ izi@@ Dalmatian risk with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to other anti@@ psych@@ oti@@ ka .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with known car@@ di@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ osis diseases ( M@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ inf@@ arkt or isch@@ ul@@ cer@@ ation disease ) , cer@@ ebral vas@@ ect@@ omy ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hy@@ genic medicines ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ak@@ zel@@ unc@@ ated and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies , which had a year or less considered , there were occasi@@ onal reports of during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; if with one with AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y , patients should occur signs and symptoms of a sp@@ ät@@ tis pul@@ ling , should be considered to reduce the dose or to break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient signs signs and symptoms developed on a m@@ ns , or not clear fever without any additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , must be set out all anti@@ psych@@ otic , including AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y . &quot;
&quot; therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used in patients with v@@ amp@@ ian waste in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese or states , which are associated with ph@@ amp@@ les in connection with caution . &quot;
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in patients associated with psych@@ osis who were treated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease patients had treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in comparison to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; however , there were in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the assu@@ mption of unwanted rov@@ ascular events with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treated patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia in some cases are extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ azi@@ osis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em Kom@@ a or death , was reported in patients who were treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y . &quot;
there are no precise risk assessment of hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related undes@@ irable events with AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic medicines @-@ treated patients to allow direct conc@@ es@@ sions .
Poly@@ di@@ p@@ her , Poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ h@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes Mell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes Mell@@ itus should regularly monitored in terms of deteri@@ oration of glu@@ cose levels . &quot;
&quot; a weight of gaining is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophr@@ enia patients and in patients with bi@@ polar Man@@ ie due to Kom@@ or@@ bi@@ ds , the use of anti@@ psych@@ otic medication , in which weight increases as a side @-@ effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l on the central ner@@ ve system , caution is advis@@ able if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines will be taken as se@@ ding ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 @-@ Ant@@ agonist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a gast@@ ric acid @-@ blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , whereby this effect is considered clin@@ ically relevant . &quot;
in a clinical trial with healthy celebri@@ ties a highly effective CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l around 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
&quot; it is expected to expect other highly effective inhi@@ bit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects and therefore should be made similar dos@@ ages . &quot;
at CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism can result the common use with highly effective inhi@@ bit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ concent@@ rations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l as compared to CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive Met@@ abol@@ ism .
&quot; when you consider the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors with AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y , the potential benefits should over@@ weig@@ h the potential risks for patients . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhi@@ bit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HIV @-@ prot@@ ections , should have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dos@@ ages . &quot;
after lo@@ osing the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors should be raised the dosage by AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y to the Dos@@ age height before the start of the accompanying therapy .
Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y administ@@ er can be administ@@ ered with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - Con@@ centr@@ ations .
in clinical trials showed cans of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l a day not significant effect on Met@@ abol@@ ism of the Sub@@ str@@ ate of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ ph@@ an / 3 @-@ method _ morph@@ in@@ an @-@ R@@ atio ) , 2C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ ra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ ph@@ an ) . &quot;
the patient should get out to notify your doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
&quot; due to the in@@ sufficient data base for the safety of people and due to the reproduction studies in the animal studies may not be applied , unless the potential benefits justi@@ fies clearly the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , with other anti@@ psych@@ oti@@ ka the patients should be war@@ ned , dangerous machines , including power vehicles , to operate , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has no negative influence . &quot;
the following side effects occurred more common ( &gt; 1 / 100 ) than in plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medical negative side effects ( * ) .
&quot; the incidence of side effects are defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; Schizophrenia - In a controlled term study study over 52 weeks , with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , has been treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , a total of reduced incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , Dy@@ na@@ emia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ ese , compared with patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 57@@ ,@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study study over 26 weeks was the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l @-@ treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another controlled study study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine therapy . &quot;
man@@ ic episodes at Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks was the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.@@ 3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment .
in a different study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those of li@@ thium treatment .
in the long @-@ time savings phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study was the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo patients .
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and plac@@ ebo , in which potentially significant changes in the rout@@ in@@ ous control parameters occurred , there is no medic@@ ally important differences . &quot;
&quot; increases of the CP@@ K ( Kre@@ atin @-@ Ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ cin@@ ase ) , generally tempor@@ arily and as@@ y@@ mpt@@ omatic , were observed at 3,5 % of patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treated patients compared to 2,0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo patients . &quot;
&quot; to the side effects associated with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and about whose appearance also has been reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , Sp@@ ät@@ tis , unwanted events and increased mort@@ ality in older demen@@ tia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and Diabetes Mell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
in clinical trials and since the market launch has been acci@@ dental or in@@ estim@@ able excess of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l alone in adult patients with estimated cans of up to 1260 mg and without death succ@@ ession .
&quot; although there is no information about the effectiveness of a her@@ edi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ hau@@ led with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ or@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose of benefits is , as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has a high plas@@ map@@ rot@@ ation mechanism . &quot;
it is susp@@ ected that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in schi@@ z@@ ophr@@ enia and Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder over the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on Dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and Ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recep@@ tors and a ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recep@@ tors con@@ veys .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a high aff@@ inity to the Dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 recep@@ tor and for Ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recep@@ tor as well as an excessive Aff@@ in@@ arity to the Ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ in@@ ep@@ ine and to the Hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ recep@@ tor .
in case of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in Do@@ cks of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks to healthy celebri@@ ties showed the Pos@@ it@@ ches @-@ E@@ missions @-@ tom@@ ography with a D2 / D@@ 3 recep@@ tor Lig@@ hts , on Nucle@@ us Rel@@ dat@@ us and at the Put@@ ten . &quot;
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short period studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1.@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ ophr@@ enia patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to plac@@ ebo a statis@@ tically significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms .
&quot; in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol controlled study was 52 the share of the Respon@@ si@@ s patients , which poses an attack on the study medi@@ ation , in both groups similar ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from Mess@@ enger , which were defined as secondary study program , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ gomery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - Dep@@ res@@ sion@@ al scale , showed a significant improvement than for Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophr@@ enia showed herself for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l a significant higher reduction of resi@@ dual percentage that was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l group and at 57 % under plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in a O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multi @-@ blind study conducted in schi@@ z@@ ophr@@ enia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients sur@@ vey@@ ed and in which the primary studies &apos; weight@@ less ( N = 18 or 13 % of the most valuable patient ( N = 18 or 13 % of the reduced patient ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg with an average weight of approx . 7 kg ) . &quot;
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l one compared to plac@@ ebo over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l against plac@@ ebo no over@@ leg@@ ged effectiveness .
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo@@ at and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psychological characteristics , showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l one compared with plac@@ ebo over@@ leg@@ ged effectiveness in week 3 and a maintenance effect , which was comparable to that of li@@ thium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol a week 12 . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l also proved to 12 a comparable share of patients with sympt@@ omatic re@@ mission of Man@@ ie on such as Li@@ thium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a Bi@@ polar disorder , with or without psychological characteristics , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l a over@@ leg@@ ged effectiveness in reducing some symptoms associated with li@@ thium or Val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ time expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic phase , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l had achieved a re@@ mission against plac@@ ebo with regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar back , pre@@ domin@@ antly in preventing a refund in the Man@@ y . &quot;
&quot; based on in vit@@ ro @-@ studies , the enzy@@ me CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydr@@ o mod@@ elling of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is responsible for the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ ries is cat@@ aly@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the middle of Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al @-@ time is in approxim@@ ate 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l on exten@@ sive Met@@ abol@@ ism on CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and with approxim@@ ate 146 hours in &apos; poor &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism on CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; at Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l there are no differences in the phar@@ yn@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy celebri@@ ties , as well as shown in a pharma@@ co@@ c@@ ine@@ tic investigation of schi@@ z@@ ophr@@ enia patients had no gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
a Populations @-@ specific evaluation of the Pharma@@ co@@ c@@ ine@@ tics have no reference to clin@@ ically significant differences in ethnic affili@@ ation or the effect of smoking on the Phar@@ fl@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
the pharma@@ co@@ c@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were similar to patients with severe kid@@ ney in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy celebri@@ ties .
&quot; a single @-@ osis study at Pro@@ ban@@ den with different tum@@ or liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ P@@ ugh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the imp@@ air@@ ment of the liver cir@@ c@@ lical of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but the study em@@ braces only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their met@@ abo@@ lic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity at repeti@@ tive gen@@ etics , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the prot@@ ect@@ ogen@@ ous potential , the pre@@ clinical data have no particular danger for the people . &quot;
&quot; Tox@@ ic@@ onic significant effects have only been observed in d@@ oses or compositions that significantly exc@@ eeded the maximum dosage or exposure , so that they have only limited or no meaning for the clinical use . &quot;

P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a tim@@ icro@@ bi@@ uli ingredi@@ ent that promotes the con@@ fis@@ cation of Mik@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli from the tubes and the Mik@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli by in@@ hibition of their Dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to a in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mi@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ular network that is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ ory cell@@ aneous functions .
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ in the Trans@@ cy@@ t@@ osis of plastic containers con@@ veys and in the framework of in @-@ vit@@ ro studies were proved that the presence of Alb@@ um@@ lit@@ ax@@ el promotes the transport of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through the end@@ ot@@ hel@@ cells .
it is believed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ dot@@ tive transportation is convey@@ ed by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ Alb@@ umin@@ ni@@ cep@@ tor and due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous Prot@@ eins SP@@ ARC ( estimated protein aci@@ dic rich in Cy@@ steine ) occurs a p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the field of tum@@ or .
&quot; the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic mamm@@ ak@@ ar@@ cin@@ oma is treated by data from 106 patients in two native studies and by 454 patients who were treated in a random@@ ized phase III , compar@@ ative study . &quot;
&quot; in a study , 43 patients were treated with metastatic breast cancer , which has been given in the form of in@@ fusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion about 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic mamm@@ ary cancer .

member states need to ensure that the owner of the approval for the transport system will provide medical personnel in di@@ aly@@ tic centres and retail stores with the following information and materials :
&quot; • training bro@@ ars • summary of the characteristics of the drug ( technical information ) , lab@@ eling and packaging system . • With clear presentation of the correct application of the product received refriger@@ ation for transport through the patient . &quot;
&quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed of a biological medicine is similar , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and also contains the same substance ( also &quot; reference purposes ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood vessels , in connection with a blood tran@@ sc@@ ant complications could occur in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion of complications and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected . &quot;

the iron values of all patients are in front of the treatment to ensure that no iron com@@ plex@@ es and fer@@ v@@ ents should be administ@@ ered during the entire treatment .
&quot; in patients who received a chemotherapy , or in patients with kid@@ ney problems can be a an@@ emia caused by a ery@@ thro@@ po@@ iet@@ in@@ gel or thereby , that the body is not sufficient to the body &apos;s own ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also applied in operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a blood loss .
&quot; it is produced by a cell , into which a gene ( DNA ) was brought up to the formation of ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; se@@ amed was compared with appointments in a v@@ ene in the context of a major capit@@ als with 479 patients who caused by kid@@ ney problems caused by kid@@ ney problems , with the reference purposes . &quot;
all patients participating in this study was at least eight weeks for E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a V@@ ene in@@ quired before they received either on se@@ amed or continue E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main index@@ ator for the effectiveness was the change of the her@@ mo@@ fic values between the beginning of the study and the completion period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
&quot; the company also laid out the results of a study before , in which the effects of the skin intensi@@ fied ab@@ se@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were investigated with 114 canc@@ els , which received a chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in the study with patients , caused by kid@@ ney problems caused by kid@@ ney problems , the her@@ mo@@ dem values were provided on se@@ amed , in the same measure as with those patients , which still received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , patients that continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , an increase of 0,0@@ 63 g / dl of the output of 12.@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side @-@ effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is a rise of blood pressure , which occasionally lead to symptoms of a encephal@@ opath@@ y ( brain problems ) such as su@@ dden , st@@ iny head@@ aches and confusion . &quot;
se@@ amed may not be used in patients who may be over@@ sensi@@ tively ( allergic ) against ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or one of the other components .
&quot; se@@ amed as inj@@ ection under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kid@@ ney problems , since other studies are required to ensure that herein is not an allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ az@@ ate ( CH@@ MP ) has been bor@@ ed to the conclusion that for Ab@@ se@@ amed , according to the provisions of the European Union of detection , the medicines has been a comparable quality , security and eff@@ ic@@ acy profile like E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;

the decision for application re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit risk exposure to the involvement of each patient which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
&quot; in patients who are intended for a larger electric ste@@ ering procedure , if possible , before the beginning of ep@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ emia is examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients who educ@@ ate themselves in a larger electrical technique , should have an appropriate Thro@@ mb@@ osis proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis , as it is an increased risk for thro@@ mb@@ otic and vas@@ cul@@ arian diseases , particularly in a fundamental cardi@@ ac disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it cannot be excluded that in treating with ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with a starting point of &gt; 13 g / dl a higher risk for post @-@ operative or v@@ ascular events can be . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled studies were not proven for ep@@ ox@@ ins that they increase the overall survival with sympt@@ omatic ana@@ emia , or dimin@@ ishing the risk of tum@@ our pro@@ gression . &quot;

the overall survival in studies could not be explained by differences in incidence of thro@@ mb@@ osis and related complications at re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ istic ery@@ po@@ e@@ tin treated patients and at controls satisfac@@ tory .
there is an increased risk for thro@@ m@@ bo@@ char@@ itable events in tum@@ our patients who are treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ istic ery@@ po@@ e@@ tin and a negative impact on the overall survive cannot be ruled out .

&quot; A@@ cl@@ asta is used to treat the following diseases : • oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease , which makes the bones de@@ br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ opause and in men . &quot;
&quot; it is applied in patients with a high frei@@ ght risk ( bone breaks ) , including in patients who have recently changed a little trau@@ mati@@ cal hips as with h@@ inf@@ all suffered . • Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et should take at least 500 mg calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip sion should be a great dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or through inj@@ ection in a muscle . &quot;
&quot; the administration of Par@@ ac@@ et@@ am@@ ol or id@@ ling ( means against infl@@ amm@@ ation ) just after the application of A@@ cl@@ asta can reduce the symptoms , like fever , muscle aches , gri@@ ev@@ ing similar symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta can be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease . &quot;
&quot; as the active ingredi@@ ent in A@@ cl@@ asta can be like in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the material material for Z@@ omet@@ a was attracted to the evaluation of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , almost 8 000 older women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and it was investigated the number of sp@@ ine and hips about a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study travel@@ ed 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , which had recently investigated a stro@@ kes over a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; by Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta was compared to a total of 357 patients and six months long with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( a different mus@@ li@@ on@@ ate ) . &quot;
&quot; the main index@@ ator for the eff@@ ic@@ acy was , whether the sal@@ ary of the al@@ kal@@ ine Ph@@ osph@@ at@@ ase in the ser@@ um ( an enzy@@ me , the bone substance re@@ builds ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or at least 75 % compared to the starting point . &quot;
in the study with older women the risk of vert@@ eb@@ rac@@ tures of patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ? ) over a period of three years compared to the patients under plac@@ ebo around 70 % .
&quot; in comparison of all patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis , the risk of hip implants by 41 % was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
in the study with men and women with hips had 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ asta a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 065 ) compared to 13 % of patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ asta occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less common in repeti@@ tive inf@@ usions .
&quot; A@@ cl@@ asta can not be used in patients , which may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ ate or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates are subject to patients at A@@ cl@@ asta to risk of kid@@ ney , reactions to the inf@@ usions and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( depart@@ ures of bone tissue ) in the j@@ aws . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ asta will be clari@@ fied material for doctors , the A@@ cl@@ asta to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis who explains how the drug use , as well as such material for patients , in which the effects of drug means are addressed and advised when they should consult with the doctor . &quot;
April 2005 the European Commission of Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited won a permit for the entry of A@@ cl@@ asta in the entire European Union .

&quot; for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and the oste@@ opor@@ osis in men will recommended a intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ asta once a year . &quot;
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ mati@@ cal hips the administration of in@@ fusion is recommended by A@@ cl@@ asta two or more weeks after the operational supply of the hips ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et should be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et .
&quot; after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et with A@@ cl@@ asta , a long re@@ sion period was observed in patients who have addressed to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition it is very advis@@ able , in patients with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , a sufficient shelter of calcium , according to twice daily at least 500 mg of element@@ ary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ asta to ensure ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recent spread low @-@ trau@@ mati@@ al stro@@ kes is a initi@@ ald@@ osis of 5@@ 0,000 to 12@@ 5.000 i.e. , or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D in front of the first A@@ cl@@ asta in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the incidence of symptoms that occur within the first three days of the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta , can be reduced by par@@ ac@@ et@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ s just after the application of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
patients with kid@@ ney interference ( see section 4.4 ) For patients with a cre@@ mat@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min is not recommended as a limited clinical experience for this patient group .
&quot; older patients ( &gt; 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary as the bio@@ availability , distribution and Eli@@ mination at older patients are similar to younger patients . &quot;
&quot; children and young teen@@ agers will not be recommended for use in children and young people under the age of 18 , as data are missing and effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cl@@ asta will be recommended for patients with severe kid@@ ney in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Cre@@ ator@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , as for this patient population only limited clinical experiences . &quot;
an existing hy@@ po@@ kal@@ ine lam@@ ine is before the beginning of therapy with A@@ cl@@ asta due to adequate supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the rapid inser@@ ting of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in the bone construction can develop a temporary , relative to sympt@@ omatic hy@@ al@@ kal@@ ine , its maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ asta occurs ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure that patients with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et is a sufficient shelter of calcium , according to twice daily at least 500 mg of element@@ ary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer disease , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids , poor oral hygiene ) should be used in front of an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate correc@@ tive tooth treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients who require the dental care , do not require any information whether the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ ate is reduced to the risk of oste@@ o@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the orth@@ odon@@ tics . &quot;
the clinical assessment by the doctor should be based on the treatment plan of each patient and are based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
&quot; the incidence of symptoms that occur within the first three days of administration of A@@ cl@@ asta , can be reduced by par@@ ac@@ et@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ s just after the application of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the incidence of severe cre@@ ases in cases of pre@@ ten@@ sen was increased in patients who received A@@ cl@@ asta ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients , the plac@@ ebo ( 0.3 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 852 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( P@@ FT , HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Recur@@ rent Fr@@ ac@@ ture Tri@@ al &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was the overall pre@@ valence of pre@@ aching ( 2,6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2,@@ 1 % ) . &quot;

&quot; kid@@ ney @-@ disturb@@ ing Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid has been linked with kid@@ ney dys@@ functions , which is an increase in the ser@@ um @-@ cre@@ mat@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as a failure of kid@@ ney failure . &quot;
the change in the Cre@@ ator@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ( every year before the administration measured ) and the appearance of kid@@ ney cancer were measured in a clinical study conducted in oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years compared between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in the Ser@@ um Cre@@ ator@@ ins within 10 days of G@@ abe was observed in 1.8 % of patients with A@@ cl@@ asta treated patients towards 0.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo patients .
&quot; based on the evaluation of laboratory findings , the temporary as@@ y@@ mpt@@ omatic values , which were under 2.3 % of the patients compared to 21 % of the patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in a large clinical trial of patients compared to 21 % of the patients with A@@ cl@@ asta in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pag@@ et @-@ Pag@@ et studies . &quot;
all patients received supplement@@ ary sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study on post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis in the study for avoiding clinical frei@@ ght trains in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pag@@ et @-@ Studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; in the study on avoiding clinical frei@@ ght frac@@ tures , the vitamin D @-@ mirror were measured not rout@@ in@@ ous , however , the majority of patients received an Initi@@ ald@@ osis Vitamin D before the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions After the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported via local reactions to the in@@ fusion , such as tube , sw@@ elling and / or pain , reports ( 0.7 % ) . &quot;

&quot; a summary of the EP@@ AR for the general public The present document is a summary of the European Public Opinion report ( EP@@ AR ) , which is explained how the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ ta ( CH@@ MP ) has been judged to see recommendations regarding the use of the drug . &quot;
Ac@@ tos is used for the treatment of type @-@ 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insu@@ lin diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( in particular overweight patients ) . • It can be used along with another di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medi@@ medication ( Du@@ al@@ Therapy ) .
&quot; in addition to Met@@ form@@ in patients ( in particular , overweight patients ) can be applied with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest possible dosage cannot be satisfac@@ tory . &quot;
&quot; in combination with an Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant or insu@@ lin can be maintained , except for patients with hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( lower blood sugar ) ; this should be reduced to the dose of the Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ gling respectively . &quot;
this means that the physical In@@ su@@ lin can be enhanced better and decre@@ ases the blood sugar levels which makes a type of 2 @-@ diabetes better .
&quot; in more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of Ac@@ tos was examined in Tri@@ ple@@ otherapy , in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with an Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant , in addition they received up to 3.5 years either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ ed hem@@ ost@@ glob@@ ine , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) , which shows how well the blood sugar has been adjusted . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to lo@@ wering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which makes it possible that the blood sugar levels used in applying the d@@ oses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg were reduced . &quot;
at the end of the Tri@@ ple@@ otherapy study the effect of the additional gift from ac@@ tos to existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant in lo@@ wering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % while the extra gift of plac@@ ebo was reduced to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
&quot; in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insu@@ lin in 289 patients was examined , the patient , the Ac@@ tos in addition to insu@@ lin , compared with 0.@@ 14 % in patients compared to 0,@@ 14 % in patients , which were in addition plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects in connection with ac@@ tos were visual dys@@ functions , infections of the upper air@@ ways ( cre@@ ases ) , weight increases and hy@@ po@@ ana@@ esth@@ esia ( dimin@@ ished sensitivity to Rei@@ zen ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos can neither be applied in patients , which may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) compared to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or one of the other components , still in patients with liver problems , her@@ es@@ in@@ suffici@@ ency or di@@ ab@@ etic K@@ eto@@ azi@@ o ( high level mirror - saw blades - in the blood ) . &quot;
&quot; it has been decided that Ac@@ tos can serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in patients , in which met@@ form@@ ations is not shown . &quot;
October 2000 the European Commission of the Company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited limited approval for the entry of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
&quot; the tablets are white to white , round , cur@@ ved and wear on one side the mark@@ ings &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the wor@@ ding &quot; AC@@ TOS . &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is also shown for combination with insu@@ lin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar is in@@ adequate with insu@@ lin due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility . ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; for application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from the presence at least one risk factor ( e.g. past cardiovascular disease or sympt@@ omatic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose of step . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a dental in@@ suffici@@ ency , weight increases or o@@ de@@ me , especially those with reduced cardiovascular reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a dental in@@ suffici@@ ency , weight increases and o@@ de@@ ms to be observed when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insu@@ lin . &quot;
a cardiovascular study conducted with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients suffering from 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and prec@@ urs@@ em@@ ec@@ ular disease has been carried out .
&quot; in this study , an increase in reports of flo@@ ating in@@ suffici@@ ency , which did not lead to an increase in mort@@ ality in the study . &quot;
in patients with increased output cells ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of norm@@ ality ) or with other signs of a liver disease may not be used .
&quot; if the AL@@ T mirror is increased to 3 @-@ fa@@ chen of the upper limit of the stand@@ ar@@ chs , the liver values are as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient symptoms developed to indicate a hep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , appeti@@ te , fatigue , Ap@@ pe@@ tit@@ ment and / or dar@@ ker ur@@ n , are the liver values to review . &quot;
the decision whether treatment of patients with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on will continue until the pre@@ conditions of the laboratory parameters accepted by the clinical assessment .
in clinical trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one has proven a dos@@ ed @-@ dependent weight of weight that can be st@@ amped by li@@ abilities and in some cases with a liquid control .
as a result of a her@@ ren@@ unci@@ ation entered under the therapy with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on a low @-@ reduction in the middle chamber ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ oc@@ ru@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) .
similar changes have been observed in compar@@ ative controlled studies with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ ines by 3 @-@ 4 % ) and at a lower extent even in patients under Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff and In@@ su@@ lin ( relative reduction of the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ ines by 1 @-@ 2 % and the hem@@ at@@ oc@@ ru@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.7 % ) .
&quot; as a result of the increased in@@ su@@ lin@@ tiveness consists of patients , the pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on as oral two @-@ professional or triple combination therapy with insu@@ lin delivery , the risk of dos@@ ages @-@ dependent hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the launch of the market , under the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , about an occur@@ rence or a deteri@@ oration of a di@@ ab@@ etic Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms with a reduction in visual ac@@ uity . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear whether there are a direct link between the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and the occur@@ rence of Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms , however , if patients report on the visual ac@@ uity ; a suitable oph@@ thal@@ mic declaration should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summar@@ izing analysis of announcements of unwanted events relating to bone brood , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients who were treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one . &quot;

&quot; in Pro@@ active study , a study on 3.5 years of investigation of cardiovascular events , coll@@ ec@@ tures stood at 44 / 870 ( 5.@@ 1 % ; 1,0 Fra@@ k@@ ours per 100 patients ) of patients with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated patients who were treated with a comparison with a comparison medi@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or that one enters the treatment ( see section 4.6 ) . &quot;
studies for investigation of inter@@ actions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on does not have any relevant effects on the Pharma@@ co@@ gen@@ etics or phar@@ mak@@ eup of diges@@ ox@@ in , war@@ nings , phen@@ pro@@ co@@ um@@ on and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; inter@@ actions with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzy@@ mes , e.g. or@@ ale contra@@ dic@@ tive , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ kan@@ alb@@ lo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duction tas@@ ers are not expected . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) resulting in an increase in the AU@@ C from Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on to the 3 @-@ fold .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2C@@ 8 @-@ In@@ duc@@ tor ) results in lo@@ wering the AU@@ C from Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is dimin@@ ished in pregnancy and increased in@@ su@@ lin@@ s resistance and thus reduce the availability of met@@ abo@@ lic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fine growth .
&quot; very frequent &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , individuals : unknown ( from the present data is not estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; these lead to a temporary change in the Tur@@ g@@ ors and the Bre@@ ch@@ ment index@@ es of the l@@ ens , as they are also observed in other hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ish agents . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on appeared AL@@ T @-@ An@@ sti@@ s across as plac@@ ebo , but less frequent than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff . &quot;
in an out@@ come study in patients with prec@@ urs@@ em@@ ec@@ ular disease has been the incidence of heavy flo@@ ating in@@ suffici@@ ency under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 1.6 % higher than in plac@@ ebo when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on .
&quot; since the launch of the market , it has been reported more frequently about Her@@ cul@@ in@@ suffici@@ ency under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , however , if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insu@@ lin or in patients with c@@ age in@@ suffici@@ ency in an@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; it has been a summar@@ ised analysis of announcements of undes@@ irable events with regard to disease breaks out of random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated groups and over 7.@@ 400 patients with compar@@ ative drug treatment performed . &quot;
&quot; in the over a period of 3.5 years ongoing pro@@ active study , coll@@ ecti@@ bles were treated at 44 / 870 ( 5.@@ 1 % ) of patients with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) at the patient who were treated with a comparison medi@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; when taking a maximum of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days occurred no symptoms . &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on seems to have a activation of specific core recep@@ tors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator Activ@@ ated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ g ) ) , which results in the animal model to an increased incidence of liver , obesity and sk@@ elet@@ on muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduces the Glu@@ co@@ se@@ production in the liver and increases the peri@@ ph@@ ere glu@@ co@@ atings in case of an insu@@ lin resistance .
a clinical trial with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d as a mon@@ otherapy has been continued for over two years to investigate the time up to the post@@ ure of the therapeutic effects ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &gt; 8.0 % after the first 6 lines ) .

&quot; in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced the average H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - value of 0,@@ 45 % , compared to the patients , which continue to have only In@@ su@@ lin ; a reduction in insu@@ la@@ in treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated in the group was observed . &quot;
clinical trials over a year showed herself under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one running a statis@@ tically significant increase in the album / Kre@@ mis@@ in @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ ves in comparison to the output values .
the effect of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( Mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small , on 18 weeks of investigation into type @-@ 2 di@@ ab@@ etics . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical trials were compared to plac@@ ebo , a reduction of the total plas@@ ma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and a rise of HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as reduced , however clin@@ ically not significant le@@ DL@@ - cholesterol levels . &quot;

&quot; in the study , after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ ed hem@@ ost@@ glob@@ ine ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which shows how well the blood sugar has been adjusted . &quot;
Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e led to a decrease of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c Spi@@ eg@@ els that resulted in the blood sugar levels as strong as with another human insu@@ lin .
Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e should not be applied in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) or one of the other components .

&quot; when the ur@@ av@@ al bri@@ cks after two to four weeks is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ ites , the dosage can be increased once daily 120 mg once daily . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment phase , you can still act Gi@@ cht@@ an@@ cies ; therefore , it is recommended that patients may take at least during the first six months in treatment with A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic still further drugs for contrac@@ eption . &quot;
&quot; the drug is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ@@ tran@@ splan@@ t , since it was not examined for these groups . &quot;

&quot; in the second study , two dos@@ ages of A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) one year was compared to 762 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot;
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol is used in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kid@@ ney problems received only 100 mg per day .
&quot; the main index@@ ator for the eff@@ ic@@ acy was the number of patients , their ur@@ ic s@@ ails in the blood of the last three measurements under 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of the patient , the A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg received , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of the patients once a day 120 mg in the blood of under 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; in comparison with this , this was at 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in no of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , rash and normal liver values . &quot;
especially in patients with cardi@@ ac be@@ ats in the pre@@ history there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects which affect the heart and blood vessels .
&quot; the committee for Human@@ arz@@ az@@ ing ( CH@@ MP ) suffered at the conclusion that A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lo@@ wering the ur@@ gency in the blood as Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side @-@ side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels . &quot;

it is therefore recommended before the beginning of Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ ues and further course depending on the clinical analysis and a liver function ( see section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line Z@@ was not conducted any inter@@ acting studies to Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at but it is known that the X@@ O &apos;s in@@ hibition can lead to an increase of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ lin@@ ders ( a shirt of Met@@ abol@@ ization by The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in was also reported for other X@@ O shirts ) .

&quot; clinical study results The effectiveness of A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC has been described in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and fact study as described below ) , which were performed with 18@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ik@@ emia and g@@ out . &quot;
&quot; the primary efficiency analysis was in each study of the percentage of patients , in which the last three months of certain ser@@ um species &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were included . &quot;
plac@@ ebo ( s = 134 ) ; A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) or Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) or Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) for patients with a ser@@ um cancer ( s = 10 ) for patients with a ser@@ um cancer ( s = 10 ) for patients with a ser@@ um cancer .
the AP@@ EX study showed significant stress levels under 6 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) ( see table 2 and figure 1 ) the statisti@@ c significant su@@ peri@@ ority of both the treatment with A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared with conventional used d@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the fact @-@ study showed significant reduction in the ser@@ um har@@ dens under 6 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) the statis@@ tically significant su@@ peri@@ ority of both the treatment with A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared with the usual dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
&quot; patients with ser@@ um cancer ( 1.5 and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 509 ) were summar@@ ised for the analyses . * p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus 80 mg . &quot;
the reduction of the Ser@@ um di@@ ap@@ plet@@ es on &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was kept in the doctor in week 2 and permanently maintained over the entire treatment .
509 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um cancer &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kid@@ ney identi@@ fies the AP@@ EX study evaluated the eff@@ ic@@ acy of 40 patients with kid@@ ney buil@@ ders ( d. h ) .
&quot; with A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary eff@@ am@@ us@@ ement was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patient . &quot;
&quot; there was no clin@@ ically significant differences in regard to the percentage revers@@ al back@@ ing of the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ ent , regardless of their kid@@ ney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kid@@ ney function and 55 % in the group treated with severe kid@@ ney dys@@ functions ) . &quot;
&quot; primary end point in the sub@@ group of patients with Ser@@ um har@@ dened concent@@ rations &gt; 10 mg / dl About 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and fact @-@ study ( Bas@@ eline ) had a Ser@@ um har@@ dened , concentration of &gt; 10 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; the data collected in two years in the open extension of the phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of the ser@@ um di@@ ap@@ plet@@ ed volumes used on &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , that less than 3 % of patients needed in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against a g@@ auge ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction of toxic@@ ity size , which at 54 % of patients had a complete dis@@ appearance of the Gi@@ cht@@ on@@ otes until month 24 . &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ - Values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in open long @-@ time extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .

for d@@ oses between 120 mg and 300 mg is observed for Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at a rise in AU@@ C which is greater than the dos@@ cent increase .
after taking easier or multi@@ pl@@ ung@@ er cans of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the C@@ max is about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.6 µ@@ g / ml .
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage decrease in the percentage of ser@@ um concentration was observed unless that has been tested ( multiple cans of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The seem@@ ing ste@@ ady state @-@ state volumes ( v@@ ss / F ) of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is in the range from 29 to 75 l after intake of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
&quot; the plas@@ map@@ rot@@ or permission of Feb@@ ur@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary bond to Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is reached on concentration levels , which is achieved with cans of 80 and 120 mg . &quot;

&quot; 3 The risk of severe mal@@ oph@@ age@@ al side effects does not seem to be raised in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or , after the appearance of symptoms , that indicate to an ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation . &quot;
it is very important that all lec@@ turer will be passed on to patients and are understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; while in large , clinical studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no increased risk has been established , rarely ( according to market leadership ) Mag@@ - and Du@@ th@@ al@@ ul@@ zer@@ a , including some severe and associated complications , reported ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;

patients should be reli@@ eved that they should be taking over the next morning at taking the intake of a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE the tablet the next morning after they noticed her om@@ is@@ ance .
they are not supposed to take two tablets on the same day but the intake of one tablet per week like originally planned for this week@@ day .
&quot; other diseases , which imp@@ aired the mineral change ( such as vitamin D @-@ lack and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ di@@ sm ) , should be treated before the beginning of therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE . &quot;

&quot; therefore , patients need to wait after taking Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at least 30 minutes before they take other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific inter@@ actions studies have not been performed , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at in clinical studies have been taken together with a variety of prescribed medicines , without having clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions . &quot;

patients should always keep the same T@@ acro@@ sse formulation and the corresponding daily dose . changes in the formulation or regime should only be made under the tight@@ er control of one in the tran@@ splan@@ tation of an experienced physician ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; in consequence of an adjustment to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic pharmac@@ euticals and appropriate dosage adjustment must be performed to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus remains intact . &quot;
the dosage of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f should be based primarily on the clinical evaluation of cont@@ ention and compatibility in the individual case and on blood @-@ handling ( see below ) .
&quot; after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , the T@@ acro@@ ion @-@ Tal@@ asso should be controlled before the conversion and over two weeks after switching . &quot;
&quot; on day 4 was the systematic exposure , measured as a talent mirror , with both form@@ ulations both in N@@ ier@@ - and with livel@@ ih@@ ood patients comparable . &quot;
careful and repeti@@ tive controls of the T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus talent @-@ mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after tran@@ splan@@ tation in Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f to ensure proper substance exposure to the immediate re@@ tran@@ splan@@ tation phase .
&quot; since T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus a substance with low Clear@@ ance can take several days , until the ste@@ ady State can be reached . &quot;
&quot; if the condition of the patient is permitted in the first post@@ operative phase , the T@@ acro@@ a treatment of intra@@ ven@@ ous ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml Concent@@ rate for the production of a backup solution ) are introduced with a dose of ca . &quot;
the duration of the application Z@@ ur supp@@ ression of tran@@ splan@@ tation is necessary to maintain the immune @-@ soup ; consequently , a maximum duration of the or@@ als therapy cannot be specified . &quot;
dos@@ er recommendations - N@@ ear@@ drop@@ splan@@ t proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of Tran@@ splan@@ tation therapy should start with 0,@@ 20 - 0,@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily guns in the morning . &quot;
further Dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tations can be later necessary since the phar@@ yn@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of T@@ acro@@ li@@ m can change in the course of stabil@@ isation of the patient after the tran@@ splan@@ tation .
dos@@ ages - Leb@@ er@@ tran@@ splan@@ t proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of Tran@@ splan@@ t therapy should start with 0.10 - 0,@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily guns in the morning .
&quot; dosage adjustment from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f must be converted from twice daily dose of pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to once daily intake of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , so this conversion has changed in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , except for the entire day @-@ dose . &quot;
N@@ ier@@ - and liver tran@@ splan@@ t after a change from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f once every day the treatment must begin with each in N@@ ier@@ - and liver tran@@ splan@@ t recommended Initi@@ ald@@ osis for the proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of tran@@ splan@@ tation .
&quot; heart tran@@ splan@@ t in adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , is an or@@ ale Initi@@ ald@@ osis of 0,15 mg / kg / day every day at the morning . &quot;
&quot; other tran@@ splan@@ ts , however , there are no clinical experience with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f at lung , p@@ ank@@ ed patients in a or@@ als Initi@@ ald@@ osis of 0,2 mg / kg / day and at intest@@ inal initi@@ ates of 0,@@ 3 mg / kg / day to apply . &quot;

patients with reduced kid@@ ney function Da the kid@@ ney function does not affect the phar@@ yn@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus can be considered that a dosage adjustment is not required .
&quot; due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ical potential of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus , however , a careful monitoring of the kid@@ ney function ( including a regular determination of ser@@ um cancer is recommended , a calculation of the Cre@@ ator@@ in@@ aug@@ ance and a monitoring of ur@@ inary tract ) . &quot;

recommendations to the Tal@@ &apos; mirror in the full bl@@ ut The dosage should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of dis@@ cont@@ ention and compatibility in the individual case under cust@@ ody of whol@@ eg@@ ion @-@ T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ asso controls .
&quot; it is recommended frequent controls of the T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ asso during the first two weeks of tran@@ splan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during invent@@ ory therapy . &quot;
&quot; blood @-@ valley of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled by Pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , Dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tion , changes of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in simultaneous application of substances which could change the T@@ acro@@ ion @-@ blood circulation , ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is a medicine with a low Clear@@ ance , adjustments of the dose may require for several days until the ste@@ ady State . &quot;
the data in clinical trials make sure that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the talent mirror in the blood 20 ng / ml cannot exceed .
in clinical practice the valley mirror of T@@ acro@@ li@@ m generally lie in the full flo@@ wering in the first time after liver tran@@ splan@@ ts usually in the range of 5 - 20 lit@@ ter / ml and with - and sav@@ oy patients with 10 - 20 lit@@ re / ml .
&quot; during the dar@@ ing reduction of liver therapy of liver , kid@@ ney@@ - and heart tran@@ splan@@ ts were usually used blood @-@ concent@@ rations in the range of 5 - 15 lit@@ ter / ml . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious undes@@ irable events , including tran@@ splan@@ ts , or other side effects , which can occur in sequence of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus sub@@ - or over@@ ex@@ position . &quot;
patients should always keep the same T@@ acro@@ sse formulation and the corresponding daily dose . changes in the formulation or regime should only be made under the tight@@ er control of one in the tran@@ splan@@ tation of an experienced physician ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 tooth treatment adult patients with tran@@ splan@@ t po@@ ison that proved to be used against other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants than therap@@ ists are still no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f .
&quot; for the proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of tran@@ splan@@ tation tests in adults and tran@@ splan@@ ts in childhood , are still no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation advoc@@ acy . &quot;
&quot; due to possible inter@@ actions that can lead to a flo@@ wering of the T@@ acro@@ id levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements , the cur@@ rants ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) contain , or other p@@ onder@@ ant drugs during treatment with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea is a particularly careful monitoring of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mia - concent@@ rations in the blood , since the T@@ acro@@ some blood levels under such circumstances may be subject to significant vibrations . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , Pro@@ gra@@ f was referred to as Kar@@ di@@ omy@@ opath@@ y referred to cam@@ mer@@ - or sep@@ um @-@ hyper@@ tro@@ phy that can therefore also occur among Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders , are an already existing heart suffering , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids , hyper@@ tension , or liver dys@@ functions , infections , liquid @-@ load and oil . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , the effect of sun@@ light or UV @-@ light should be restricted because of the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin changes through suitable clothing or use of an umbrella with a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients , the T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus take symptoms of PRE@@ S such as head@@ aches , changed consciousness levels , cl@@ amping and visual dys@@ functions should indicate a radi@@ ologic examination ( e.g. &quot;
&quot; da Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f Hart@@ cap@@ es , re@@ tar@@ es , re@@ tar@@ osis , L@@ act@@ osis is included in patients with the rare gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , le@@ act@@ ase @-@ lack or glu@@ cose Gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ absor@@ ption specific caution . &quot;
the simultaneous application of medicines or herbal medicines that are known as Hem@@ mer or In@@ duc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can influence metabolism of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus and thus increasing the blood values of T@@ acro@@ sse .
&quot; it is therefore recommen@@ ds to change the T@@ acro@@ li@@ mia - blood levels in the same gift of substances which can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and to adjust the T@@ acro@@ sse dose to maintaining equal concent@@ rations in accordance with ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
a strongly distinctive interaction has been marked with An@@ tim@@ y@@ k@@ oti@@ ka such as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and Vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ol as well as with the Macro@@ lid @-@ antibiotic Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ agonist ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; Pharma@@ co@@ ine@@ tic studies that the increase of blood levels primarily from the increased bio@@ availability of T@@ acro@@ ix@@ mus , caused by the in@@ hibition of gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal diseases , resulting from the in@@ hibition of gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal diseases . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ domin@@ ate pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as it is used by ac@@ ute exp@@ ul@@ ating actions , the concentration of T@@ acro@@ ix@@ ism can increase or decrease in blood . &quot;
effect of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines T@@ acro@@ li@@ m is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhi@@ bit@@ ors ; therefore the simultaneous application of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus can be met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed the metabolism of metabolism .
&quot; since T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus the Clear@@ ance of Ster@@ oid contr@@ ap@@ ec@@ tiv@@ a and thus increase the hormon@@ al position , is particularly careful in decisions about recep@@ tive measures to be particularly careful . &quot;
&quot; the results of animal attempts have shown that T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus potentially reduce the Clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ one , and pro@@ long their half @-@ value . &quot;
the results of a small number of exam@@ inations at Tran@@ splan@@ t@@ ation@@ sp@@ ati@@ sts do not provide any indication that under T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants a higher risk for unwanted events in regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .

Adv@@ oc@@ ate is used to treat and prevention of blood vessels in patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( one by the lack of factor VIII @-@ related , inn@@ ate ble@@ eding inter@@ rup@@ ture ) . &quot;
the dosage and frequency of application can then be applied to whether to be applied to treatment of ble@@ eding or to prevention of blood@@ stream at surgical procedures .
&quot; patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency , which causes blood problems like ble@@ eding in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extrac@@ ted from human plas@@ ma but according to a method that is called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA @-@ Technology &quot; :
&quot; it is produced by a cell , into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which it is applied to the formation of the human body factor . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ oc@@ ate is another in the European Union approved medicines called re@@ produce , similarly , however , is no other way that the drug contains no proteins human@@ istic or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies of patients with heavy to moderate H@@ äm@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the use of the drug was examined in prevention of blood@@ stream and surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the capit@@ als , the effectiveness of Adv@@ ates was rated by the prevention of ble@@ eding in 86 % of 510 new blood@@ thir@@ teen sessions with &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; good &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ z@@ zin@@ ess , head@@ aches , Py@@ re@@ xy ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; advoc@@ ate must not be applied in patients , which may be over@@ sensi@@ tively ( allergic ) against the human body factor VIII , mouse , or Ham@@ ster@@ ility , or any of the other components . &quot;
March 2004 the European Commission of B@@ ax@@ ter AG shared a licence for the transport of Adv@@ ates throughout the European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution treatment are based on the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII deficiency according to the place and extent of the blood and the clinical state of the patient .
in the following ug@@ mor@@ ant events the factor VIII activity in the corresponding period does not apply to the specified plas@@ mas@@ room ( in % of the standard or in i.e. / dl ) .

inj@@ ection all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk for the patient is over .
during the treatment it is stim@@ ulated to control the dose and pre@@ valence of inj@@ ections an appropriate determination of the factor VIII @-@ plastic straps .
&quot; individual patients can distinguish in their reaction to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo Recovery and different sem@@ iconduc@@ tors . &quot;

&quot; if the expected factor VIII @-@ plas@@ ma@@ activities will not be reached or if the blood@@ stream is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be performed to im@@ itate an In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so other therapeutic measures must be saved . &quot;
&quot; the administration speed is intended to address the patient , with maximum inj@@ ection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exc@@ eeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ ality antibodies against the factor VIII is a known comp@@ lication in treating patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .

&quot; the patients affected by the largest number of patients were inhi@@ bit@@ ors against the factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , which played all patients treated in previously untreated patients who had a higher risk to the formation of inhi@@ bit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ z@@ zin@@ ess ( each 3 patients ) . &quot;

&quot; it is a type of virus that has changed so , that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body . &quot;
&quot; in the virus in Adv@@ ancement , it is a &quot; A@@ den@@ ovi@@ rus &quot; which has changed so that there are no copies of themselves and therefore no infections can trigger . &quot;
&quot; advoc@@ acy should be carried out directly into the tum@@ ors , and thus to allow cancer cells to make the normal p@@ 53 protein again . &quot;
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is made of the non @-@ def@@ ects in the human body existing p@@ 53 gene , usually contributes to the recovery of cor@@ rupt DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered . &quot;
&quot; at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is def@@ ect , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company laid data from a study with a patient before the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the area of the sub@@ field , in the bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP the answers of the company had checked the questions , there were still some questions to be clari@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; based on the inspection of the submitted documents the CH@@ MP is created on day 120 , a list of questions that will be sent to the company . &quot;
according to the CH@@ MP was not sufficiently demonstrated that the inj@@ ection of Adv@@ ancement in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ors benefits for the patient .
&quot; the committee also had concerns about the processing of drug in the body , the type of administration , as well as the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not proven sufficient that Adv@@ anc@@ ements can be manufactured and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient which is harmful . &quot;
&quot; the CH@@ MP is not aware of whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who currently have a result of clinical trials or &quot; com@@ pression @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ancement . &quot;
changing active ingredients &apos; means that the tablets are composed of that one of the effective components immediately and the other is slow down over a few hours .
&quot; Aer@@ ori@@ ze is used for treating the symptoms of seas@@ onal allergic rhin@@ itis ( l@@ ending stress , caused by an allergy to pol@@ len ( infl@@ amm@@ ation of the nas@@ al paths ) in patients with nas@@ al skin cells ( hidden nose ) . &quot;
in adults and adoles@@ cents from 12 years the recommended dose of aer@@ ena twice a tablet with a glass of water should be taken with or without food .
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ended as soon as the symptoms , especially the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al skin ( hidden nose ) , break@@ down . &quot;
a treatment of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of drug can end on the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
&quot; the main @-@ effective dimensions were the changes of the sword @-@ cycle of the l@@ ending sympt@@ om sympt@@ om , which reported from the patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment were reported . &quot;
&quot; during the trial , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a di@@ ary and evaluated with a standard sk@@ ala , how heavy the symptoms included in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; in viewing of all the h@@ ay symptoms sympt@@ om except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported the patients , the aer@@ on@@ ze took over a decrease of symptoms around 46,@@ 0 % , compared with 35,@@ 9 % in the patient , the pse@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al skin was considered , the patients under Aer@@ ori@@ ze showed a alle@@ viation of symptoms around 37,@@ 4 % compared to 26,@@ 7 % in the patient , the Des@@ ten@@ at@@ adin alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aer@@ ina@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ ma ( cardi@@ o ) , oral , fatigue , head@@ ache , fatigue , fatigue , fatigue , fatigue , fatigue , fatigue and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ ori@@ ze is allowed to be used in patients , which may not be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ ten@@ at@@ adin , Pse@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or one of the other ingredients , against in@@ ep@@ an@@ ine ingredients or Lor@@ at@@ adin ( a different medicines for the treatment of allergi@@ es ) are not being applied . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ ena may also not be used in patients who have suffering from a bott@@ len@@ angle glau@@ com@@ a ( high speed pressure ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ y ( hyper@@ tension of the thy@@ ro@@ id ) , or have already caused a ug@@ mor@@ ant stroke ( hyper@@ tension of the thy@@ ro@@ id ) or have already suffered a risk for a ug@@ ar stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission of the SP Europe adopted a licence for the transport of aer@@ ators in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , is to swal@@ low in whole ( i.e. without it to break or ch@@ ew ) . &quot;
Aer@@ ori@@ ze should be applied to harm@@ lessness and eff@@ ic@@ acy ( see section 5.1 ) in children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not continue to end the symptoms .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the use of time to 10 days , as long @-@ term application the activity of pse@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine can decrease in time . &quot;
&quot; after drop the sw@@ elling of the vei@@ ls of the vei@@ ls in the upper breath@@ s , the treatment can be continued when needed with Des@@ ten@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; as aer@@ on@@ ze Pse@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the drug is also contra@@ sting in patients infected with a mon@@ o@@ am@@ ino@@ x@@ id@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhi@@ bit@@ or ( MA@@ O ) inhi@@ bit@@ or within the two weeks after the end of such a therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity using a combination of Pse@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin , Per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Cab@@ erg@@ oline , Er@@ got@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , Eph@@ ed@@ rine , Oxy@@ gen@@ ac@@ olin , Nap@@ ht@@ olin , etc . ) . &quot;
the safety and the effectiveness of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient . and the data is not enough to speak for appropriate recommendations for dosage .
the safety and effectiveness of aer@@ on@@ ze were not checked in patients with kid@@ ney or liver inter@@ rup@@ tions and the data will not submit to the appropriate recommendations for dosage .
&quot; patients need to be informed about that treatment in appearance of a hyper@@ tension or a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ nation , or any other neuro@@ logical , cardi@@ ac disease , nau@@ sea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such head@@ aches or rein@@ forcement of head@@ aches ) must be set . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of the following patients groups , patients suffering from digit@@ alis • patients with cardi@@ ac disease patients suffering with hyper@@ tension • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with a m@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ inf@@ arkt , in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , blad@@ der hal@@ so@@ ons or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ mus in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ ori@@ ze is at least 48 hours before the realisation of dermat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka otherwise can prevent positive reactions to indicators of Hau@@ tre@@ aties or in their extent . &quot;
&quot; within the framework of clinical trials with Des@@ ten@@ at@@ adin , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in addition have been administ@@ ered , however , were not clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions or changes in the plas@@ mak@@ on@@ cology of Des@@ ten@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or@@ ical tests could not be noticed differences between the patients suffering and the patients treated with plac@@ ebo , ir@@ respective of whether Des@@ ten@@ at@@ adin alone or with alcohol was taken . &quot;
&quot; the enzy@@ mes for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ ten@@ at@@ adin responsible enzy@@ mes has not been identified yet , so interaction with other medicines cannot be excluded completely . &quot;
Des@@ ten@@ at@@ adin inhi@@ bited in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not , and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bited and neither a sub@@ str@@ ate nor an In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of the P gly@@ co@@ red . &quot;
&quot; the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ ena during pregnancy is not guaranteed , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies , however , no increase in frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities , compared to the incidence of normal population . &quot;
&quot; because Re@@ production studies on animals are not always transmitted to people , and due to the vas@@ cal properties of Pse@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine should not be applied aer@@ on@@ ze in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be clari@@ fied , however , that in very rare cases can lead to an imp@@ air@@ ment of traffic or ability to use machinery . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a Z@@ NS depression ( Se@@ aling , Ap@@ nea , Kom@@ a , Cardiovascular Diseases ) and a Z@@ NS Stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pless@@ ness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , Tre@@ ble , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ als . &quot;
&quot; head@@ ache , anxiety , fri@@ ght@@ en Mik@@ tion , muscle weak@@ en and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ orie , arous@@ al , irrit@@ ation , so@@ othing , tran@@ sist@@ ence , vom@@ iting , Tinnitus , no@@ dul@@ es , visual dys@@ functions and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; a Z@@ NS Stimulation is most likely , as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth@@ wash , p@@ up@@ ill@@ ag@@ ar and - di@@ lat@@ ation , cur@@ rant , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; this close both the in@@ hibition of fre@@ ading of pro@@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory cy@@ tok@@ ines like IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human m@@ ast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the Ad@@ j@@ sion@@ sm@@ ol@@ ek@@ ü@@ ls P @-@ Sel@@ ect@@ tin on End@@ ot@@ hel@@ per . &quot;
&quot; with an individual osis study involving adults , Des@@ ten@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes including the strengthening of subjective battles or the tasks that are linked to the traps . &quot;
in controlled clinical trials at the recommended dosage of 5 mg a day no increased incidence of sl@@ ender compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; the or@@ ale application of Pse@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage may cause other sympath@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ nation or manifest@@ ations of a Z@@ NS @-@ arous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; there were 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seas@@ onal allergic rhin@@ itis part , with 414 patients aer@@ on@@ ze tablets were received . &quot;
&quot; in both studies the hist@@ amine agon@@ istic effectiveness of Aer@@ ori@@ ze tablets , determined based on the total cor@@ es for symptoms ( except nas@@ al skin @-@ sw@@ elling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pse@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of Aer@@ ori@@ ze tablets with regard to the sw@@ elling effect , determined by the nose @-@ down skin , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ ten@@ at@@ adin over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
the effectiveness of aer@@ ena tablets showed no significant differences with regard to gender , age or ethnic groups . &quot;
in the scope of a single @-@ dose study on the Phar@@ in@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ ori@@ ze is Des@@ ten@@ at@@ adin within 30 minutes after the administration of the plas@@ ma .
&quot; after the per@@ or@@ als application of Aer@@ ori@@ ze at healthy celebri@@ ties over 14 days the flow @-@ weight of Des@@ ten@@ at@@ adin , 3 @-@ hydr@@ o @-@ lor@@ at@@ adin and pse@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine on day 10 has been reached . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of a pharma@@ co@@ c@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ type study , which has been carried out with the wor@@ ding as tablets to healthy adult celebri@@ ties , has been established that four pro@@ hibition has been poor@@ ly galvan@@ ized . &quot;
a component of inter@@ actions study shows that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of Pse@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio@@ eth@@ ane equivalent to the sole gift of Pse@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio@@ ular equivalent was for exposure to the gift of a aer@@ ena tablet .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , for toxic@@ ity at repeti@@ tion gen@@ etics , to gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and to re@@ productions the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ ten@@ at@@ adin however , does not recognise particular dangers for the people . &quot;
&quot; the combination poss@@ essed no greater toxic@@ ity than their individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredi@@ ent of Pse@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine . &quot;
in reproductive studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin / Pse@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine used in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day not ter@@ at@@ ato@@ gen .

A@@ eri@@ us was evaluated in a total of eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and young people with allergic rhin@@ itis ( including four studies with seas@@ onal allergic rhin@@ itis and two studies of patients who had also as@@ thma ) .
&quot; the effectiveness was measured by the variation of symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the squares , imp@@ air@@ ment of sleep and performance in the day ) before and after six@@ ties treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been submitted to im@@ itate that the body take the sy@@ rup , the solution to inser@@ ting and the mel@@ ting tum@@ or in the same manner as the tablets and the application in children is harm@@ less . &quot;
&quot; if allergic rhin@@ itis led when the results of all studies have been taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us to increase average of 12 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patient , which received a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
in the two studies at Ur@@ tik@@ aria was the decrease of sympt@@ omatic treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared to 40 and 33 % in the patients treated with plac@@ ebo patients .
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be over@@ sensi@@ tively ( allergic ) against des@@ cen@@ at@@ adin , Lor@@ at@@ adin or one of the other ingredients . &quot;
January 2001 the European Commission of the SP Europe adopted a licence for the transport of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union .
&quot; one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms in allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and Persian rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see under section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there are limited experience from clinical trials to effectiveness in the application of Des@@ ten@@ at@@ adin people from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
&quot; the treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis ( appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the results of the disease , and may termin@@ ated after the end of the symptoms and at their re@@ plac@@ ements . &quot;
&quot; in the Persian allergic rhin@@ itis ( appearance of symptoms , 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during allergi@@ es period . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were established in the context of clinical studies with Des@@ ten@@ at@@ adin tablets were not established in which Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in addition have been administ@@ ered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clin@@ ically pharma@@ cological study has not been reinforced by A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol imp@@ lic@@ ating effects of alcohol ( see below section 5.1 ) .
&quot; however , patients should be clari@@ fied in very rare cases that can lead to imp@@ air@@ ment of transportation or ability to use machinery . &quot;
&quot; clinical studies in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , were reported at recommended dose of 5 mg a day 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , when patients were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects , over the more common than in plac@@ ebo were reported , fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , oral drying ( 0,8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0,@@ 6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with 578 adoles@@ cent patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side @-@ effect head@@ aches , these occurred at 5.4 % of patients who were treated with Des@@ ten@@ at@@ adin and were treated with 6.7 % of patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ gym study , where up to 45 mg of Des@@ ten@@ at@@ adin ( ninth clinical dose ) have been administ@@ ered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory cy@@ tok@@ ines like IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human m@@ ast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the Ad@@ j@@ sion@@ sm@@ ol@@ ek@@ ü@@ ls P @-@ Sel@@ ect@@ tin on End@@ ot@@ rop@@ pers . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of a clinical study with multi @-@ disciplinary study , in Des@@ ten@@ at@@ adin in a dose of up to 20 mg a daily over 14 days , no statis@@ tically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clin@@ ically pharma@@ cological study , in Des@@ ten@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 mg a day ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold the clinical dose ) was administ@@ ered over ten days each day , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c Inter@@ v@@ alls showed itself . &quot;
&quot; in a single dos@@ er study with adults , Des@@ ten@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes including the strengthening of subjective battles or the tasks that are linked to the traps . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the alle@@ viation of symptoms like Ni@@ esen , Nas@@ en@@ secre@@ tion and Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z the nose , it@@ ch , tr@@ ash flu@@ ence and red@@ ness of the eyes and it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rhin@@ itis can be divided into dependence on the duration of the symptoms , also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and pers@@ ist allergic rhin@@ itis . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
pers@@ ist allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the appearance of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks .
as shown by the total cor@@ es of the ques@@ tionn@@ aire of the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ Kon@@ junk@@ ti@@ vi@@ tis was shown to be dimin@@ ished A@@ eri@@ us effectively the allergic rhin@@ itis prot@@ ru@@ ed burden .
the chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria has been dep@@ rec@@ ated for further forms of ur@@ tik@@ aria as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is ir@@ respective of the eth@@ ni@@ ology in different forms and chron@@ ological patients can be recru@@ ited from recur@@ ring patients .
&quot; as the Hist@@ oric Value is a cur@@ ative factor in all ur@@ etic diseases is expected , that Des@@ ten@@ at@@ adin is expected to improve symptoms , except in other forms of the Ur@@ tik@@ aria to an improvement of symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first tin . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka in chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the minority of patients who do not re@@ acted on anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka , from the study . &quot;
an improvement of it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients compared to 19 % of patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo patients .
the treatment with ast@@ eri@@ us reduced the disorder of sleep and wax@@ es significantly as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to assess these variables .
&quot; in a pharma@@ co@@ c@@ ine@@ tics study , where patients @-@ demo@@ graphics with the general seas@@ onal rhin@@ itis -@@ population was comparable to 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of desktop . &quot;
there are no cl@@ ue for a clin@@ ically relevant g@@ ulation after once daily use of Des@@ ten@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days before .
&quot; the enzy@@ mes for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ ten@@ at@@ adin responsible enzy@@ mes was not yet identified , so inter@@ actions with other medicines will not be excluded completely excluded &quot;
Des@@ ten@@ at@@ adin inhi@@ bited in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bited and neither a sub@@ str@@ ate nor an In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of the P gly@@ co@@ red .
&quot; in a single dos@@ is@@ Study with Des@@ ten@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of 7.5 mg of effective meals ( fatty , cal@@ ori@@ ental breakfast ) does not affect the availability of desktop . &quot;
the performed with Des@@ ten@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ atal studies showed in a compar@@ ative degree of exposure of Des@@ ten@@ at@@ adin , no qualitative or quantitative differences with regard to the toxic@@ ity profil@@ ing of Des@@ ten@@ at@@ adin and of Lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity at repeti@@ tive gen@@ etics , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and to re@@ production process , the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ ten@@ don &apos;t recognize any particular dangers for the people . &quot;

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals to alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and pers@@ ist allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see below section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rhin@@ itis can be caused by a infection ( see under section 4.4 ) and that no data is prescribed for treatment of a inf@@ ectious rhin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respir@@ atory diseases , or an@@ atom@@ ical an@@ om@@ ali@@ es should play a role in diagnos@@ ing the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , bodi@@ ly investigations and appropriate laboratories . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of met@@ abo@@ lic Des@@ ten@@ at@@ adin and experience a higher sub@@ str@@ ate load ( see below section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the security of A@@ eri@@ us Si@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , the limited met@@ abo@@ lic , is identical to the children that normally met@@ abo@@ li@@ ze normal met@@ abo@@ lic . &quot;
&quot; this drug contains Sac@@ char@@ ose and Sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with inher@@ ited problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glu@@ cose Gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ absor@@ ption or a sac@@ char@@ ase inhi@@ bit@@ or in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not established in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in addition have been administ@@ ered ( see below section 5.1 ) .
in a clin@@ ically pharma@@ cological study has not been reinforced during the intake of A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see below section 5.1 ) .
the overall side of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Si@@ eri@@ us Si@@ rup Group similar to plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; clinical studies with adults and young people in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , were reported at recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , when patients were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ gym study in adults and young people , at which up to 45 mg of Des@@ ten@@ at@@ adin ( ninth clinical dose ) have been administ@@ ered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; children aged between 1 and 11 years came into question for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy , received a daily descent of 1,@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) . &quot;
&quot; because the course of allergic rhin@@ itis / chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ ten@@ at@@ adin people are similar in adults and children , the eff@@ ic@@ acy data of Des@@ ten@@ at@@ adin can be ex@@ tr@@ apped in adults on the children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of a clinical study with multi @-@ disciplinary study of adults and young people , in Des@@ ten@@ at@@ adin in a dose of up to 20 mg a daily over 14 days , no statis@@ tically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
in a clin@@ ically pharma@@ cological study of adults and teen@@ agers who was applied in a dose of 45 mg a day ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) over ten days in adults showed no renewal of the Q@@ T@@ c Inter@@ v@@ alls .
in controlled clinical studies at the recommended dosage of 5 mg per day for adults and young people have no increased incidence of sl@@ ot@@ ance compared to plac@@ ebo .
a single @-@ day dose of 7.5 mg led ap@@ eri@@ us tablets with adults and young people in clinical studies to no imp@@ air@@ ment of the psych@@ omot@@ ors .
in clinical @-@ pharma@@ cological studies of adults it was not affected by simultaneous intake of alcohol neither to a strengthening of alcohol @-@ induc@@ ed performance nor to an increase in battles .

&quot; A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be caused by adults and elderly people to protect flu , which is caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of influ@@ enza @-@ A @-@ virus . &quot;
&quot; this is a special kind of vaccine that could cause a trunk of the flu , which could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; a Gri@@ pp@@ ep@@ an@@ dem@@ ie breaks out if a new trunk of the flu is emerging , which can easily spread from man to man because people still have built no im@@ munity ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; according to administration of the vaccine recogni@@ zes the immune system the immune system contained in the vaccine is contained in the vaccine as &quot; &quot; physical &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; thus , the immune system later is able to form a contact with a grip virus of this pedi@@ gre@@ e faster antibodies . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the membran@@ es of the virus was dis@@ connected with the &quot; &quot; surface @-@ surface &quot; ( proteins on the membran@@ e interface , which recogni@@ zes the human body as body @-@ alien ) , and be used as an element of the vaccine . &quot;
a inspection of some of the study reveals that the study was not performed in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
the extent of the clinical data base for evalu@@ ating the safety of the vaccine is not made to fulfill the requirements of the guidelines of EME@@ A for pre@@ pan@@ dem@@ ic vacc@@ ines .

&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ vi@@ ral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which is caused by human im@@ weak@@ ening virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which caused the er@@ ected immune we@@ aving Immun@@ e Def@@ iciency Syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who can not swal@@ low the capsules , as@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution for entry , but this cannot be taken along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the security of this combination was not examined . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should only be arranged if the doctor has been tested , which anti @-@ vir@@ ral drugs of the patient has previously taken , and the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood has judged that the virus is talking to drug . &quot;
recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice a day which are taken along with twice daily 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ vi@@ ral medicines .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg is the recommended dose of as@@ gener@@ ase according to body weight .
A@@ generated decre@@ ases in combination with other anti@@ vi@@ ral medicines the HIV amount in the blood and holds it at a low level .
&quot; AIDS not to cure AIDS , however , may delay the damage of the immune system and thus also delay the development of associated with AIDS infections and illnesses . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in combination with other anti@@ vi@@ ral medicines but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 736 HIV @-@ infected adults , which previously had not been treated with prot@@ agonist . &quot;
this with low do@@ si@@ ert@@ em Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased medicines A@@ generated was taken at 206 adults that had previously been prot@@ ect@@ able formerly compared to other proteins .
the main index@@ ator for the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ect@@ able concent@@ rations of HIV in the blood ( Vir@@ us@@ last ) or the change of Vir@@ us@@ last after treatment .
&quot; in studies with patients who had previously had no prot@@ agonist had taken over 400 copies under using 400 copies / ml than plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ gener@@ ase has also decreased the Vir@@ us@@ last but with the children , formerly been treated with prot@@ agonist , only very few to the treatment . &quot;
in the study with adults that had been treated earlier by prot@@ ect@@ avi@@ r reinforced medicines A@@ gener@@ ase the Vir@@ us@@ last after 16 @-@ week treatment as well as other prot@@ agonist :
&quot; in patients with HIV , that was up against four other proteins of drugs , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase , together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of the Vir@@ us@@ last after four weeks as in the patients who continue their previous proto@@ coll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( di@@ arr@@ ings ) , Flat@@ ul@@ ence ( par@@ aly@@ sis ) , vom@@ iting , rash and Fatigue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
&quot; 2 / 3 A@@ generated ase may not be applied in patients , which may be over@@ sensi@@ tively ( allergic ) against Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase may also not be used in patients , the cur@@ rants ( a herbal preparations for the treatment of depression ) or medicines that are just as A@@ generated as@@ ase and are in high concent@@ rations in the blood of health harmful . &quot;
&quot; as with other drugs against HIV , the A@@ gener@@ ase is taking , the risk of a Li@@ po@@ dy@@ stro@@ phy ( change in the distribution of the body fat ) , a oste@@ o@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( precip@@ itation of bone tissue ) or an immune re@@ activation ( symptoms of an infection , which is caused by the rec@@ ess immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ nei@@ ra ( CH@@ MP ) gel@@ te to the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral medicines to treat patients with prot@@ ect@@ oral drugs called HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken along with the pharma@@ co@@ c@@ ine@@ tic amplifier , but the committee firmly established that the benefits of A@@ generated in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have previously had no prot@@ agonist . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , as at the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information . &quot;
&quot; October 2000 , the European Commission of the G@@ lax@@ o Group approved a licence for the transport of as@@ gener@@ als throughout the European Union . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase is combined with other anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1@@ - infected ( PI ) -@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
for usually A@@ generated capsules are to administ@@ er capsules to the pharma@@ co@@ c@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ klet of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r together with low d@@ oses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r should take place taking into account the individual vi@@ ral resistance and the treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the bio@@ availability of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take up is 14 % less than by Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ generated capsules and solution to inser@@ ting on a milli@@ gram ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ generated capsules is 600 mg Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r twice a day with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral medicines .
&quot; 2 If A@@ generated capsules are applied without the increased supplement of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ klet ) , higher d@@ oses to A@@ generated ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; recommended dose for A@@ generated capsules , 20 mg Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r which should not be exc@@ eeded ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the pharma@@ co@@ c@@ ine@@ tics of eff@@ ic@@ acy and safety of A@@ generated in combination with low d@@ oses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other proto@@ coll@@ ars were not examined by children .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for application in children under 4 years , due to the lack of data to harm@@ lessness and eff@@ ic@@ acy ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on the pharma@@ co@@ c@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose should be reduced to A@@ gener@@ ase capsules for adult patients with medium @-@ he@@ ater liver disorder on 450 mg twice a day and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions to 300 mg twice a day . &quot;
simultaneous application should be treated with caution with more easily or reduced life @-@ working with caution when patients with severe liver inter@@ rup@@ ture is con@@ stitut@@ ed ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ generated must not be given simultaneously with pharmac@@ euticals that have a small therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ate of the cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzy@@ mes 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations are included ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) must not be applied because of the risk reduced plastic @-@ concent@@ rations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ f@@ avi@@ r during the intake of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ generates or any other anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opport@@ un@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral therapy including treatment with A@@ generated does not prevent the risk of transfer@@ ring HIV on others through sexual contact or cont@@ amination with blood .
&quot; for usually , A@@ generated capsules are to be applied together with low d@@ oses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients who are suffering from chronic hep@@ atitis B or C and treated with an anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral combination therapy , an increased risk for serious liver inter@@ actions with potentially fat@@ al course . &quot;
for the case of simultaneous anti@@ vi@@ ral treatment of hep@@ atitis B or C please read the concerned professional information of this medicine .
patients with existing reduced life function including a chronic @-@ active hep@@ atitis show an increased incidence of liver dys@@ functions under an anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
&quot; the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with fluor@@ tic@@ as@@ on or other Glu@@ co@@ ok@@ or@@ tik@@ oid changes , unless the possible benefits to treat the risk of systematic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ atings , including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the cl@@ aws of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ e @-@ reduction Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is a simultaneous appointments of A@@ generated with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin because of the increased risk of My@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ ses not recommended . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ nings ( under supervision of the International norm@@ alization R@@ atio ) , stand methods for determining the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; in patients that take these medicines at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced Plas@@ mas@@ room of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r . ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of met@@ abo@@ lic inter@@ actions with Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contra@@ indications can be modified , but the information is not sufficient to appreciate the type of inter@@ actions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time using Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on the ress@@ buch sympt@@ om , especially if there are also low d@@ oses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the possible risk of risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high prop@@ ylene gly@@ co@@ col@@ ts of the A@@ generated solution to the entry , this portra@@ yal of children under the age of four years and should be applied with caution at certain other patient groups . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase should be placed on duration 5 if a rash may be accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms or the vei@@ ls are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; in patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral therapy including proteins , was reported on the appearance of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or an exc@@ itation of an existing Diabetes Mell@@ itus . &quot;
&quot; many of the patients had other diseases , to whose therapy drugs were necessary to connect with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; B. higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral treatment and the associated met@@ abo@@ lic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in h@@ amm@@ op@@ hil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ agonist , reports about an increase of ble@@ eding including spontaneous ha@@ emat@@ aner hem@@ at@@ oms and hem@@ or@@ thro@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in HIV infected patients with serious immune def@@ ect , at the time the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an infl@@ amm@@ able reaction to as@@ y@@ mpt@@ omatic or res@@ dual opport@@ un@@ istic infections that leads to severe clinical states or deteri@@ oration of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a multi@@ fac@@ torial apples is adopted ( including the use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher Body @-@ Mass Index ) , were reported cases of O@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose especially in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width of A@@ generated must not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a small therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ate of the cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzy@@ mes 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width of A@@ generated with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be changed together with pharmac@@ euticals , whose substances are pre@@ ten@@ ded primarily via CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are linked to the increased plas@@ mas@@ room with heavy and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects . &quot;
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in has caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C by Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to a resistance development .
&quot; when attemp@@ ting , the reduced plastic mas@@ room through a dosage increase of other prototype inhi@@ bit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were very often unwanted effects on the liver . &quot;
Johann@@ is@@ k@@ ova ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The Ser@@ um mirror of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with Johann@@ is@@ matic ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient is already taking bro@@ ods , the amp@@ f@@ avi@@ ral mirror and if possible to check the Vir@@ us@@ last and en@@ force the cur@@ sor . &quot;
a dosage adjustment for one of the drug is not required if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administ@@ ered together with Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ ency below ) .
&quot; 508 % increased , for C@@ max against 30 % lower , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
in clinical trials dos@@ ages of 600 mg Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r twice a day and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day who occupy the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this treatment schem@@ at@@ as .
52 % lower when Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice a day ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) .
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r in Plas@@ ma , which were achieved in combination of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) , in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day . &quot;
&quot; a lec@@ turer for the simultaneous appointments of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , it is recommended for a closer monitoring , since the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; no pharma@@ co@@ c@@ ine@@ tic study conducted in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , due to the an@@ ta@@ ci@@ de component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , is due to the revenue of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ generates at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
therefore at G@@ abe from E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ ency in combination with Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) no dosage is required .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ ency in combination with Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both Prot@@ eas@@ e@@ ers would be low .
the effect of ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ ine to other prot@@ ect@@ e@@ ers and existing limited data can be mu@@ cked that Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ ine may possibly sen@@ sed the Ser@@ um@@ kon@@ zentration of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if these medicines should be used at the same time , caution is advis@@ able because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din due to decreased or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plas@@ mas@@ on may be less effective . &quot;
&quot; if these medicines are used together , caution is advis@@ able ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made since a precise forecast of the effect of combining Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult for Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din . &quot;
the simultaneous under@@ carriage of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to a rise in the plas@@ mak@@ u@@ tin ( AU@@ C ) by ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 193 % and thus related to a rise of associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to administ@@ rate ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with A@@ generated dose , becomes a reduction of dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose , although there is no clinical data . &quot;
Phar@@ fl@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies of A@@ generated in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin have not been carried out but could be increased the plas@@ mas@@ on of both drugs in the case of simultaneous appointments .
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase in the C@@ max of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plas@@ ma around 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 ) in comparison with the value that was observed after 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily without simultaneous application of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhi@@ bit@@ or in@@ duction of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , if they are applied together with A@@ generated , possibly to inter@@ actions . &quot;
patients should therefore be associated with toxic reactions that are associated with these drugs if they are used in combination with A@@ generated .
&quot; based on the data of other proteins , it is advis@@ able that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da is not taken at the same time as A@@ generated , since it can be res@@ or@@ ption disorders . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ s@@ va , which are known as enzy@@ me ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degra@@ dation of the plas@@ mas@@ room of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; the Ser@@ um concent@@ rations of Cal@@ ci@@ um can@@ alb@@ lock@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Fel@@ ger@@ pin , Wall@@ ra@@ pin , Ni@@ eu@@ pin , Nim@@ fe@@ pin , Nim@@ fe@@ pin , Nis@@ odi@@ pin , Nis@@ odi@@ pin , Nis@@ odi@@ pin , Nis@@ odi@@ pin , Nis@@ odi@@ pin , Nis@@ odi@@ pin , Nis@@ odi@@ pin , Nis@@ odi@@ pin , Nis@@ odi@@ pin , Nis@@ odi@@ pin , Nis@@ odi@@ pin , Nis@@ odi@@ pin , Nis@@ odi@@ pin , Nis@@ odi@@ pin , Nis@@ odi@@ pin , Nis@@ odi@@ pin , Nis@@ odi@@ pin , Nis@@ odi@@ pin , Nis@@ odi@@ pin , Nis@@ odi@@ pin , Nis@@ odi@@ pin , Nis@@ odi@@ pin , Nis@@ odi@@ pin , Nis@@ odi@@ pin , Nis@@ odi@@ pin , Nis@@ odi@@ pin , Nis@@ odi@@ pin , Nis@@ odi@@ pin , Nis@@ odi@@ pin , Nis@@ odi@@ pin , Nis@@ odi@@ pin , Nis@@ odi@@ pin , Nis@@ odi@@ pin , Nis@@ odi@@ pin , Nis@@ odi@@ pin , Nis@@ odi@@ pin , Nis@@ odi@@ pin , Nis@@ odi@@ pin , Nis@@ odi@@ pin , Nis@@ odi@@ pin , Nis@@ odi@@ pin , Nis@@ odi@@ pin , Nis@@ odi@@ pin , Nis@@ odi@@ pin , Nis@@ odi@@ pin , Nis@@ odi@@ pin , Nis@@ odi@@ pin , Nis@@ odi@@ pin , Nis@@ odi@@ pin ,
the simultaneous medication with A@@ generated may increase their plas@@ ma @-@ concent@@ rations and increase with PD@@ E@@ 5 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors in conjunction with PD@@ E@@ 5 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors in conjunction with PD@@ E@@ 5 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors in conjunction with PD@@ E@@ 5 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in a clinical study , in Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ al ( 4 @-@ times daily ) over 7 days on Pro@@ ban@@ den , the Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ous ( 4 @-@ times daily ) , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol has significant ( 90 % -@@ Kon@@ fi@@ den@@ c@@ inter@@ val 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; consequently , the simultaneous grid of A@@ generated with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended along with these glu@@ cose o@@ ids not recommended , unless the possible benefit of treatment is the risk of systematic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids of effects ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduction inhi@@ bit@@ ors , such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , which is dependent heavily by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are pronounc@@ ed increases of the plas@@ mas@@ room at equal arrangement of A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
since plas@@ mas@@ floor increase of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduction inhi@@ bit@@ es can lead to my@@ opath@@ y including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of these medicines with Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended for a common monitoring of therapeutic concent@@ rations until stabil@@ isation of the mirror , since the Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ concent@@ rations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus can be increased by Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied together with oral into the Mid@@ az@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while at the same application of A@@ gener@@ ase , with par@@ enter@@ al mid@@ az@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mid@@ az@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ect@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors show a possible increase in the plas@@ mas@@ room from Mid@@ az@@ ol@@ am around 3@@ - to 4 @-@ fold .
&quot; when Meth@@ ad@@ on along with Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r administ@@ ered , patients should therefore be monitored on the ress@@ ourc@@ ed sympt@@ om , especially if there are also low d@@ oses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the use of small aband@@ on@@ eness of historical sources , there is no recommendation to be given as the Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ ons dose is to adjust if Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r will be administ@@ ered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ on . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous abilities of war@@ nings or other or@@ als anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ anti@@ es along with A@@ gener@@ ase , an enhanced monitoring of the IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or rein@@ force the anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ al effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ eption is not predic@@ table , therefore , as alternative methods are recommended for contrac@@ eption . &quot;
careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example D@@ esi@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended in simultaneous guidance of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; this drug may only be used during pregnancy just after careful consideration of the potential user for the mother , compared to the possible risks for fatty acids . &quot;
&quot; in the milk lak@@ eb@@ ender , Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were proven , but it is not known whether Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r goes to man into the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
a re@@ production study to imp@@ air@@ borne rats that was administ@@ ered by the in@@ scription in the uter@@ ine to the end of the lac@@ tation Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r until the end of the breast@@ feeding time Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r showed a dimin@@ ished increase of the 12 body weight in the offspring .
the further development of the offspring including fer@@ til@@ isation and re@@ productions are not affected by the administration of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r to the parent &apos;s mother .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ generated was examined in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral medicines .
most of the A@@ generated treatment connected effects were easy to moder@@ ated , occurred early and rarely led to the treatment of treatment . &quot;
&quot; with many of these events is not clari@@ fied , whether they are associated with the intake of A@@ generated drugs or at the same time the HIV @-@ treatment applied drugs , or whether they are a result of atro@@ ci@@ ous diseases . &quot;
most of the above side effects are developed from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 30@@ 01 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with prot@@ ect@@ oral in@@ cis@@ es patients 1200 mg A@@ generated twice daily received . &quot;
&quot; events ( degree 2 to 4 ) , which have been root@@ ed by the investig@@ ators and in connection with the study medi@@ ation , and in more than 1 % of patients were performed , and under the treatment of treatment changes ( degree 3 to 4 ) are listed . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral combination therapy has been associated with a re@@ distribution of the body fat ( Li@@ po@@ dy@@ stro@@ phy ) in HIV @-@ patients , including a loss of peri@@ ph@@ er@@ em and fast @-@ visual fatty tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ vi@@ vi@@ cal li@@ abilities . &quot;
&quot; under 113 anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral not prescribed individuals who were treated with Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r in combination with Lam@@ iv@@ udi@@ n / Z@@ id@@ ov@@ udi@@ n over a medium duration of 36 weeks , was only one case ( pin ) ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , at 245 NR@@ TI@@ - prescribed patients under Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) at 241 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various NR@@ TI@@ s on a medium duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; skin attacks were usually easy to moder@@ ated , ery@@ them@@ atic or mak@@ u@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and disappeared spont@@ ane@@ ously during the second treatment week and disappeared spont@@ ane@@ ously during two weeks without having to be broken with Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
cases of O@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose especially were reported in patients with generally known risk factors to reports HIV @-@ disorder or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral combination therapy ( ART ) .
&quot; in HIV infected patients with serious immune def@@ ect , at the time the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an infl@@ amm@@ able reaction to as@@ y@@ mpt@@ omatic or res@@ dual opport@@ un@@ istic infection ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in with PI prescribed patients , the 600 mg A@@ generated Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( degree 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( degree 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( degree 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( degree 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( degrees 3 and 4 ) have been observed in patients , the A@@ gener@@ ase , together with low do@@ si@@ ert@@ em Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in case of transition , the patient is able to observe signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , are necessary supporting measures needed . &quot;

&quot; anti@@ vi@@ ral activity of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 I@@ I@@ IB has been studied in ac@@ utely and chronic de@@ pressed cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peri@@ ph@@ eren blood@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; the 50 % less Hem@@ m@@ kon@@ zentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0,@@ 012 to 0,@@ 08 µ@@ M in ak@@ ut infected cells and amounts 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells . &quot;
the connection between the activity of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vit@@ ro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication of human beings is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral not pre @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r d@@ oses were rarely observed with prot@@ ect@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations rarely .

&quot; the conclusions with regard to relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation@@ ers can be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is advised to attract the current interpre@@ tations @-@ systems for analysis of the results of resistance tests . &quot;
on ph@@ onic resistance @-@ test@@ able analysis clin@@ ically vali@@ dated ect@@ oral interpre@@ tations can be applied in conjunction with the gen@@ otypes of the activity of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ect@@ able isolation .
&quot; companies , the diagnostic resistance testing , have clin@@ ically developed @-@ ph@@ onic cl@@ ility ex @-@ off@@ s ( divi@@ ders ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV that can be applied to the interpretation of results of a resistance test . &quot;
&quot; each of these four with a reduced sensitivity against Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r associ@@ ated genetic patterns creates a certain cross @-@ resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity against In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data for cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r and other proteins for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resistance , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral patients , with which a Fos@@ ap@@ ren@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ in@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r reserves its activity against some other prot@@ ect@@ able insu@@ lin resistance ; the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and the type of resistance mut@@ ations in isolation . &quot;
the early break of a vers@@ y therapy is advised to hold the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in limits which can affect the subsequent treatment .
&quot; the cover of the effectiveness of A@@ generated in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day based on vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( 600 mg twice daily ) and nuclear therapy ( standard of care , So@@ C ) , with a PI , mostly with a humili@@ ated Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; , &quot; received . &quot;
&quot; 100 @-@ three @-@ thir@@ teen ( n = 163 ) patients with a weight@@ ed virus sensitivity to A@@ generated , at least another PI and at least a NR@@ TI were included in the partial study A by PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
&quot; the primary analysis presented the non @-@ leg@@ ality of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the So@@ C @-@ PI group in terms of the time @-@ an average level of average ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the Plas@@ ma for 16 weeks , in a non @-@ leg@@ ged shaft of 0,@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml . &quot;
&quot; the cover of the effectiveness of un@@ constitutional A@@ generated is based on two un@@ controll@@ able studies with a total of 288 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18 , from which 152 with PI were treated . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , A@@ generated solution to take and capsules in d@@ oses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients 20 mg / kg twice a day . &quot;
&quot; there was no low met@@ ering Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of the patients treated with PI , previously had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the following with A@@ generated NR@@ TI@@ s . &quot;
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the included patients had a plas@@ ma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 @-@ R@@ NA concentration &lt; 10.000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with a medi@@ a@@ increase in CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the starting point . &quot;
&quot; 19 Bas@@ tion to this data should be considered at the therapy optimization with PI , to be expected to be an anticipated benefit from &quot; &quot; unbeliev@@ able &quot; &quot; A@@ generated ase &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after the first administration of the average duration ( t@@ max ) to maximum ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r , approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0,5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; 508 % increased , for C@@ max to cut 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) along with Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) . &quot;
&quot; the administration of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % of the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r 12 hours to dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by dietary intake , although the simultaneous food intake influences the scale and rate of res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
the seem@@ ing volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be added to a large proportion of volume as well as an enormous penetration of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r from the blood cycle to the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the drug in plas@@ ma , whereby the amount of unbeliev@@ able Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active proportion , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ break@@ able Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r remains unchanged , pregnant the percentage share of free active invent@@ ories during the overall drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady state over the area of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ ed or inhi@@ bit@@ ate or a sub@@ str@@ ate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 to be administ@@ ered with caution when they are given simultaneously with A@@ generated 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ generated capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leading to a similar daily Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r exposure , like in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r is out of the solution 14 % less bi@@ ble , as of the capsules ; therefore , A@@ generated solution and A@@ generated capsules are not inter@@ change@@ able on a milli@@ gram . &quot;
&quot; also the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r negl@@ ect , therefore the impact of a kid@@ ney failure to be small on the Eli@@ mination of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these treatment schem@@ ata lead to Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r @-@ Plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ eg@@ els compared to those who get to healthy celebri@@ ties after a dose of 1200 mg Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r twice a day without simultaneous appointments of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .

these liver toxic@@ ity can be observed and detected in clinical everyday life by measurement of A@@ ST , AL@@ T and the activity of al@@ kal@@ ine Ph@@ osph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; until now , in clinical studies there has been no significant liver damage in patients , neither during the administration of A@@ generated still after the end of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; studies on toxic@@ ity in juven@@ iles , which have been dealt with at an age of 4 days , showed both in control and with Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r treated animals a high mort@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; in case of system@@ ic Plas@@ ma@@ ex@@ position , which was significantly higher ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the anticipated ex@@ position under therapeutic dosage with human beings , however , were observed a number of minor changes including Th@@ y@@ mus@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and low sc@@ atter@@ ies changes observed in a delay . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ generated capsules are applied without the increased supplement of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ klet ) , higher d@@ oses to A@@ generated ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; recommended dose for A@@ generated capsules , 20 mg Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r which should not be exc@@ eeded ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
simultaneous application should be carried out in patients with weak or more liver inter@@ rup@@ ture with caution when patients with severe liver inter@@ rup@@ ture is it contra@@ indications ( see section 4.3 ) .

A@@ generated should be noti@@ fied on duration 27 if a rash may be accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms or the vei@@ ls are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; increased risk for a Li@@ po@@ dy@@ stro@@ phy has been associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral treatment and the associated met@@ abo@@ lic disorders . &quot;
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in has caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C by Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to a resistance development .
&quot; 508 % increased , for C@@ max against 30 % lower , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r in Plas@@ ma , which were achieved in combination of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) , in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day . &quot;
&quot; a lec@@ turer for the simultaneous appointments of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , it is recommended for a closer monitoring , since the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ ency in combination with Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both Prot@@ eas@@ e@@ ers would be low .
&quot; if these medicines are used together , caution is advis@@ able ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made since a precise forecast of the effect of combining Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult for Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to administ@@ er ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with A@@ gener@@ ase , becomes a reduction of d@@ osing rate of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose 31 out , although there is no clinical data . &quot;

&quot; with simultaneous abilities of war@@ nings or other or@@ als anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ anti@@ es along with A@@ gener@@ ase , an enhanced monitoring of the IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or rein@@ force the anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ al effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous appointments of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg eth@@ in@@ yl@@ est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1,0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ ind@@ ron ) led to a withdrawal of AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r around 22 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this drug should only be applied only after careful consideration of the potential user for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
a re@@ production study to imp@@ air@@ borne rats that was administ@@ ered by the in@@ scription in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r until the end of the breast@@ feeding time Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r showed a dimin@@ ished increase of body weight in the offspring .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ generated was examined in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral medicines .
&quot; in case of transition , the patient is able to observe signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , are necessary supporting measures needed . &quot;

the cre@@ ams is sitting in front of the bed@@ time thin in the affected skin surfaces so that they remain sufficient for long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before they washed off .
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( same cre@@ ams , but without the active material ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies of 923 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area of 16 weeks . &quot;
the main index@@ ator for the eff@@ ic@@ acy was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined to 724 patients with small bas@@ al@@ cell@@ ul@@ cin@@ oma in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or the plac@@ ebo every day or five times a week .
the main index@@ ator for the eff@@ ic@@ acy was the number of patients with complete precip@@ itation of tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies at a total of 505 patients with ac@@ ular ker@@ at@@ ories .
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than plac@@ ebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in genital area was 15 % to 52 % to patients with al@@ ebo patients . • The results of the two studies were treated with plac@@ ebo . • The results of the two studies were treated to Bas@@ al cell@@ ular patients compared to 0 % to 3 % in plac@@ ebo group . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cre@@ ams ( pain or it@@ ch ) .

&quot; a break in the above @-@ term treatment should be weigh@@ ed , if intense local infl@@ amm@@ ation actions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or if in the treatment area a infection is observed . &quot;
&quot; if you follow the follow @-@ up investigation 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the untreated shops are only in@@ complete , should a different therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;

&quot; in other studies , in which no daily pre@@ auth@@ orization has been carried out , two cases of severe ph@@ im@@ osis and one case have been observed with a circum@@ cis@@ ion of leading stri@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; in an application of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od cream in higher than the recommended d@@ oses , there have been observed risk for heavy local skin supplements ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , which made a treatment necessary and / or lead to a temporary physical imp@@ air@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions came at the end of the ur@@ eth@@ ra , some women had trouble passing ur@@ ges , which made a emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; for the application of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od cream , immediately following treatment with other k@@ ut@@ an app@@ rais@@ als available for the treatment of extreme co@@ war@@ ts in the genital and peri@@ odic@@ als are now no clinical experience . &quot;
&quot; limited data suggest to be an increased rate of war@@ nings of HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od cream in this patient group in relation to elimin@@ ating the war@@ ts however showed a lower effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of Bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od within 1 cm around the eyel@@ id , the nose , the lips , or the hair@@ line has not been studied . &quot;
local Hau@@ tre@@ actions are common but the intensity of this reaction takes generally during the therapy or the reactions form after completing the treatment with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od cream .
&quot; if it is required due to the complaints of the patient or because of the sever@@ ity of the local skin actions , a treatment @-@ break can be made of several days . &quot;
the clinical result of therapy can be judged after the re@@ generation of the treatment performed approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .

&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and prescribed BC@@ C@@ s are no clinical experience , therefore the application is not recommended for previously treated tum@@ ors . &quot;
data from an open clinical trial indicate that in large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) is a lower probability of contact to the I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od therapy .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od was not investigated for the treatment of ak@@ tin@@ ism on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or the ears or on the lips area within the lips run . &quot;
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od for the treatment of ak@@ tin@@ ism in an@@ atom@@ ical places outside the face and the scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the gre@@ ased ker@@ ato@@ ose on the sub @-@ arms and hands support the effectiveness in this application , therefore , such an application is not recommended . &quot;
local Hau@@ tre@@ aties often appear on but these reactions usually take in the course of therapy in intensity or go back after the treatment of therapy with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od cream .
&quot; when the local Hau@@ tre@@ aties to the patient will cause great discomfort or are very strong , the treatment can be exposed for some days . &quot;
&quot; in the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 AC@@ s l@@ esi@@ ons rises a lower complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 stores . &quot;
&quot; because of the imm@@ ac@@ ul@@ ating properties , I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients who received an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for the enzy@@ me therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a mu@@ kop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ ch@@ ari@@ ot I ( M@@ PS I ; α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) applied to treat the not neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( the symptoms that are not related to brain or ner@@ ves in connection ) .
&quot; this means that certain substances ( Gly@@ kos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ can@@ e , G@@ ags ) are not re@@ constructed and thus ash@@ amed in most organs in the body . &quot;
&quot; the following not neuro@@ logical symptoms of the M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , sti@@ cking joints , the movements are compl@@ aining , dimin@@ ished pneum@@ atic volume , heart and au@@ dition . &quot;
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inher@@ ited met@@ abo@@ lic diseases .
&quot; the administration of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or clinic with re @-@ insul@@ ating devices , and patients may require corresponding medicines to explo@@ it an allergic reaction . &quot;

&quot; in the study , mainly the security of the drug was examined , but it was also measured its effectiveness ( by increasing its effect in relation to the reduction of g@@ ag concent@@ rations in the ur@@ ine and regarding the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under the age of five years of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me the G@@ ag @-@ concent@@ rations in the ur@@ ine around 60 % , and half of the children gathered a normal large liver at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , sick@@ ness , ab@@ ache , rash , rash , sor@@ eness , pain@@ s , fever , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion place . &quot;
&quot; very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , decreased oxygen @-@ satur@@ ation ( a measurement size of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ die ( acceler@@ ated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients , which may possibly be strongly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lak@@ tic reaction ) , not being applied . &quot;
&quot; the European Drug Agency ( EME@@ A ) will be all new information , which may possibly be known , check and update this summary required . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will get patients who received al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , with regard to the reactions to in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies . &quot;
June 2003 the European Commission adopted by the G@@ enzy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. approval for the entry of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by using Ch@@ o @-@ mam@@ mal @-@ cell culture ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , eggs of the Chinese HAM@@ ST@@ ERS ) . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is a long @-@ time enzy@@ me therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a mu@@ kop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ ch@@ ari@@ fier I ( M@@ PS I , α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase ( M@@ PS I , α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place by a doctor , the experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inher@@ ited met@@ abo@@ lic disorders . &quot;
&quot; the initial inf@@ usions rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient contributes to a maximum of 43 E / kg / h / h . &quot;
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients may not be advised .
the safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kid@@ ney or liver in@@ suffici@@ ency has not been determined and for these patients may not be a lec@@ turer .
&quot; with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , patients can develop inf@@ usions @-@ related reactions , which are defined as any related to effect , which occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the information period ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , particularly these patients should continue to be sur@@ vey@@ ed and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be made available in a reasonable clinical environment in which the re@@ covering facilities for medical treatment should be available immediately . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase @-@ 3 study , it is expected to constitute almost all patients Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the treatment starts . &quot;
patients that develop antibodies or symptoms of inf@@ usions @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; because little experience regarding the res@@ um@@ ption of treatment after a longer break , must be cau@@ tious due to the theore@@ tically increased risk of risk , after a break in the treatment . &quot;
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti @-@ py@@ ru@@ dic@@ s ) to minim@@ ise the potential occur@@ rence of inf@@ ectious reactions .
&quot; in the event of light or medium @-@ serious inf@@ all @-@ related reaction should treat treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and Par@@ ac@@ et@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ s , and / or a reduction of inf@@ usions on half of the in@@ fusion rate , where the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a single , heavy inf@@ usions , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reported to decrease in treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and Par@@ ac@@ et@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ s . &quot;
in@@ fusion can be added with a reduction of inf@@ usions on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate when the reaction has occurred .
3 are ( Anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and Par@@ ac@@ et@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ s and / or Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids ) as well as a reduction of inf@@ usions on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate , in which the prec@@ eding reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied at the same time with chlor@@ o@@ quin or Proc@@ ain because a potentially risk of interference with in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular recording of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; animal experim@@ ental studies do not leave direct or indirect impact on pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no data to new@@ bor@@ ns that were ex@@ pon@@ ted towards Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , the mother &apos;s milk , is recommended , during treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me are not breast@@ feeding . &quot;
the effects in clinical trials were rank@@ ed mainly as inf@@ usions that have been observed at 53 % of patients in phase 3 @-@ 3 study ( treatment of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study conducted with participants under 5 years ( treatment of up to 1 year ) .
unwanted drug actions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me that were observed during phase @-@ 3@@ - study and their extension at a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older during treatment period of up to 4 years are commonly observed ( &gt; 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper breathing paths and lungs in the pre@@ history , there were heavy reactions to , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ mus , breathing and face @-@ face ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children &apos;s unwanted drug inter@@ actions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a ph@@ as@@ - 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged 5 years , with mainly severe sever@@ ity and a treatment period up to 12 months , reported are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; intra@@ ven@@ ous once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg of intra@@ ven@@ ous once weekly , 200 E / kg of intra@@ ven@@ ous every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg of intra@@ ven@@ ous every two weeks . &quot;
&quot; for most patients it occurred within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment at a Ser@@ ok@@ on@@ version , whereby it was usually reported during a month at a Ser@@ ok@@ on@@ version ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the phase @-@ 3 study ( or up to an early retirement out of the study ) , with 13 / 45 patients had no longer refer@@ enc@@ itation ( Ri@@ p ) Ass@@ ay @-@ refer@@ able antibodies before , including 3 patients , where it has never came to ser@@ o@@ version . &quot;
&quot; patients with error to lower antibodies to lower Kur@@ ds is a robust reduction in the G@@ ag @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els in Har@@ n , while in patients with high antibodies to establish a variable reduction of g@@ ag in Har@@ n . &quot;
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in the phase @-@ 2 study ) showed a mar@@ gin@@ ally to low neutral neutr@@ ality inhi@@ bit@@ or activity in vit@@ ro that seemed to imp@@ ly affected the clinical effectiveness and / or the reduction of g@@ ag in Har@@ n .
&quot; the presence of antibodies seemed not to stand in connection with the incidence of unwanted drug actions , even if the occur@@ rence of undes@@ irable medicines typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G @-@ antibodies . &quot;
the ration@@ ale for the enzy@@ me therapy is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulation of accumulation and the prevention of a further accumulation of adequate recovery of the enzy@@ mes .
&quot; after intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the cycle and of cells into Ly@@ s@@ os@@ omen , most likely about Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recep@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ized , double @-@ blind , plac@@ eb@@ ok@@ ont@@ rol@@ ed phase @-@ 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , the majority of patients reported from the medium phen@@ otype , and only one patient pointed to the heavy phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited if they had an ongoing exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the anticipated FE@@ V and the absolute distance in 6 @-@ Min@@ ut@@ - Ge@@ ht@@ est .
all patients were subsequently rec@@ ru@@ sted for an Open @-@ label extension study where they received further 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
&quot; after 26 weeks therapy , the patients associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients compared to the plac@@ ebo group , an improvement of the lung function and the sal@@ ability to appear in the following table . &quot;
in the open renewal study an improvement and / or maintaining these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 182 weeks in plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as shown from the following table .
the withdrawal of the expected pro@@ zent@@ u@@ inal FE@@ V is not significant about this time period and the absolute lung vol@@ um@@ ina increased further propor@@ tional to the body size of growing children .
&quot; from 26 patients with a Hep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly reached in front of treatment 22 ( 85 % ) until the end of the study , a normal life size . &quot;
&quot; within the first 4 weeks , a marked precip@@ itation of the G@@ ag mirror in Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ in@@ in ) was established until the study @-@ end . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the heter@@ ogen@@ eous path@@ ologies , among the patients that has been taken into account by using a combined end @-@ point ( too expected pro@@ zent@@ u@@ inal norm@@ ales ) , a result of 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration at 9 patients ( 20 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
&quot; it has been conducted a one @-@ year open phase @-@ 2 study , in which mainly the safety and pharma@@ co@@ c@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined at 20 patients who were under the time of their recording in the study under 5 years old ( 16 patients with heavy duty form and 4 with the medium speed form ) . &quot;
in four patients the dosage was increased due to increased G@@ AG@@ - Spiegel in Har@@ n in week 22 in the last 26 weeks on 200 E / kg .
&quot; in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight of weight ( n = 3 ) , according to the Z @-@ Score ( &lt; 2.5 years ) , and all 4 patients with the medium speed form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with severe swe@@ ating form was limited limited , or no progress in cogni@@ tive development . &quot;
in a phase @-@ 4 study conducted studies on pharma@@ co@@ odynam@@ ic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ Do@@ si@@ lic@@ enc@@ ata on the G@@ ag @-@ Spiegel in Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute drive . &quot;
&quot; intra@@ ven@@ ous once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg of intra@@ ven@@ ous once weekly , 200 E / kg of intra@@ ven@@ ous every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg of intra@@ ven@@ ous every two weeks . &quot;
&quot; the Do@@ si@@ tiz@@ ing scheme with 200 E / kg of intra@@ ven@@ ous every two weeks can be possible in patients , the difficulties with weekly inf@@ usions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two do@@ si@@ fications are equal . &quot;
&quot; the European Medi@@ c@@ ines Agency ( EME@@ A ) will evaluate all new information that will evaluate each year , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug are updated . &quot;
the pharma@@ co@@ c@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged 5 years was similar to older and less strongly affected patients .

A@@ lim@@ ta is being used together with Cis@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) if cancer patients cannot be res@@ ent@@ able ( drugs against cancer ) or spread itself easily to other parts of the body ) . • Moder@@ ate or metastatic &quot; non @-@ cl@@ onal &quot; lung cancer .
A@@ lim@@ ta is not treated with patients who have previously been treated in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapy as well as some therapy .
&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should be treated as Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and fol@@ ate ( a vitamin C ) and inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administ@@ ered together with cis@@ pl@@ atin should be added before or after the gift of Cis@@ pl@@ atin additionally a &quot; anti@@ em@@ e@@ tik@@ um &quot; ( drugs against vom@@ iting ) and flu@@ ids ( around a liquid man@@ gel ) .

&quot; the active form of P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , thus slow the formation of DNA and R@@ NA and prevent the cells . &quot;
&quot; the transformation of P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed to its active form is easier than in cancer cells than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concent@@ rations of active form of drugs and a longer active period of cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of mal@@ ig@@ ail Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ o@@ oms , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a capit@@ als to 456 patients who had previously received any chemotherapy against their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ kl@@ ed lung cancer the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were treated in a study of 571 patients with local current or metastatic disease , which previously had previously been treated with chemotherapy ( or other medicines for cancer ) . &quot;
A@@ lim@@ ta also was compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another medicine against cancer ) and both in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study on 1 725 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
&quot; patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ pl@@ atin , survi@@ ved on average 12,@@ 1 months , compared to 9,@@ 3 months at the all@@ low administration of Cis@@ co@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients who had previously received a chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8,@@ 3 months , compared with 7.8 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , patients referred to cancer in which the cancer did not attack the record epi@@ thel@@ ial cells , during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer survival times than with the comparison medi@@ a@@ medication . &quot;
September 2004 the European Commission opened the company El@@ i Lil@@ ly Nederland B.@@ V. a permit for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta in the whole European Union .
each di@@ p @-@ bottle has to be raised with 4.7 ml 0.58 % of Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ chl@@ ori@@ de inj@@ ection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) - which gives a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dosage is taken from the test bottle . and with 0.3 % of Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ chl@@ ori@@ de res@@ sources ( 9 mg / ml ) on 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA has been shown in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin on the first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic bron@@ chi@@ al cardi@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is shown for the treatment in two @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - radic@@ ally advanced or metastatic bron@@ chi@@ al@@ kar@@ cin@@ oma except for och@@ ism epi@@ thel@@ ial Hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) administ@@ ered as a intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of Cis@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - In@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ kl@@ ed bron@@ chi@@ al@@ kar@@ cin@@ oma after the st@@ aging chemotherapy is the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F administ@@ ered as a intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; to reduction the incidence and sever@@ ity of Hau@@ tre@@ actions , the day before and on the day of P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed goods , as well as on the day after the treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed must be taken at least 5 cans of fol@@ ate acid , and intake must continue during the entire therap@@ i@@ ed@@ auer and for further 21 days after the last P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot;
patients also have to receive an in@@ tra cular inj@@ ection inj@@ ection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) during the week prior to the first P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed dosage and after each third operator .
&quot; in patients who receive P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed should be created before each gift , a complete blood picture should be created , including a differenti@@ ation of the leu@@ co@@ cy@@ tes and a Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ sus . &quot;
the al@@ kal@@ ine Ph@@ osph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ at @-@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( A@@ ST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ in @-@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should be &lt; 3 @-@ fold of the upper border level . &quot;
at the start of a new treatment cycle must take place a dosage examination under the considerations of the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ ug@@ atory toxic@@ ity of the previous treatments .
&quot; after recovery , patients must be treated according to the instructions in the tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are available for AL@@ IM@@ TA as a mon@@ chem@@ y or combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria comply with the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity Criteria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) &gt; C@@ TC Grad 2 ble@@ eding .
&quot; should patients not develop @-@ ug@@ mat@@ ological toxic@@ ity &gt; degree 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy has to be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA , until the patient has the value before the treatment &quot;
the treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA has to be broken if in patients after 2 dos@@ ages of medication or non @-@ ug@@ mat@@ ological toxic@@ ity degrees 3 or 4 appears or so@@ - on the appearance of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies have no indication that in patients aged 65 years or in comparison to patients aged 65 years or in comparison with patients aged 65 years of age .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to the in@@ concei@@ vable data and eff@@ ic@@ acy .
clinical trials were necessary for patients with a cre@@ mat@@ in@@ Clear@@ ance of &gt; 45 ml / min no dosage adjustment necessary for all patients recommended Dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tations .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ mat@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of under 45 ml / min was not adequate ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver function@@ alities of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fa@@ chen of the upper b@@ ili@@ ru@@ bies and / or trans@@ amine of the upper bound@@ ary value ( near liver metastatic breast ) or &gt; 5,0 @-@ fa@@ chen of the upper border value ( near Leb@@ ede@@ metastatic rab@@ bits ) are not specifically examined in studies . &quot;
patients must be monitored with regard to the expertise and P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed may not be administ@@ ered to patients before their absolute neutr@@ ality count is again a value of &gt; 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ lin@@ ders has reached a value of &gt; 100.000 cells / mm ³ .
a dosage reduction for further cycles is based on the Nazi neutr@@ ality of the absolute neutr@@ ality number and maxim@@ ally non @-@ ug@@ ly toxic@@ ity how they have been observed in the prec@@ eding cancer cycles - ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of degree 3 / 4 ha@@ emat@@ ological and non @-@ smoking toxic@@ ity such as neutr@@ ality and infection with degrees 3 / 4 Neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie has been be@@ o- when a pre @-@ treatment with fol@@ ate and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
&quot; therefore , all patients have to be reli@@ ed with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed patients , fol@@ ate and vitamin B@@ 12 as proph@@ y@@ - lak@@ tic measure to use @-@ borne toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to medium @-@ in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Cre@@ ator@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous medication ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ s and Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ ls@@ tic acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and min@@ des@@ - TEN@@ S 2 days after therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; all patients , intended for treatment with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , the intake of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ time guarantee for at least 5 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients in which these events occurred , corresponding risk factors for the appearance of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre@@ valence of hyper@@ tension or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant flu@@ ence - accumulation in the trans@@ cell@@ ular space an dra@@ in@@ age of the result in front of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed treatment . &quot;
&quot; 5 severe cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ inf@@ arkt , and zer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events have been reported in clinical trials with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed occasionally , if this substance is usually administ@@ ered in combination with other cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ical ingredients . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated cells ( except Gel@@ b@@ fi@@ eber , this vaccine is contra@@ sting ) not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the possibility of a ir@@ reversible conduc@@ tion of reproductive @-@ conduc@@ tivity , should men should be advised before the treatment - g@@ ases should be advised to get advice regarding lock . &quot;

&quot; as no data relating to the intervention potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ term as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or Ro@@ fe@@ co@@ xi@@ b , the simultaneous application with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed must be avoided at least 5 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ - mixed . &quot;
&quot; the big in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the same status during the disease and the possibility of inter@@ actions between or@@ als antibodies and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation R@@ atio ) if the decision was taken to treat the patient with or@@ als anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ul@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; there are no data for the use of P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed pregnant at pregnancy , but as with an@@ de@@ - ren An@@ tim@@ pan@@ ol@@ ites are anticipated at an application in pregnancy serious birth def@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed may not be applied during pregnancy , except if absolutely - challenging and careful consideration of the utility for the mother and the risk for the fo@@ etus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the possibility of a ir@@ reversible damage to the reproductive @-@ conduc@@ tivity of the reproductive @-@ conduc@@ tivity , should men should be advised before the treatment course , advice on the control system . &quot;

it is used in overweight adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BM@@ I ) of &gt; 28 kg per square meters in conjunction with a cal@@ orie swe@@ poor diet .
patients who are taking all@@ i and ask for 12 weeks no weight of weight should apply to their physician or pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; these enzy@@ mes are inhi@@ bited , they can not re@@ build some fats into the food , thereby causing a quarter of the low @-@ run fats un@@ di@@ gesti@@ ble the intest@@ ine . &quot;
in a third study All@@ i was compared with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in the two studies of patients with a BM@@ I of &gt; 28 kg / m2 had patients , the All@@ i 60 mg received , after one year an average weight loss of 4,8 kg compared to 2,3 kg in intake of plac@@ ebo . &quot;
in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 could not be observed for patients more relevant weight loss .

it may not be applied in patients that are treated with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( for preventing the organs of tran@@ splan@@ tation ) or with pharmac@@ euticals in preventing blood cl@@ auses .
&quot; it may not be applied to patients suffering from a long term Mal@@ absor@@ ption body ( where did not suffer enough nutrients from the diges@@ tive tract ) or to ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase ( a liver disease ) , and in pregnant or near m@@ others . &quot;
July 2007 the European Commission of G@@ lax@@ o Group approved a licence for the entry of Or@@ list@@ at G@@ SK in the entire European Union .
all@@ i is to be reduced to the weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I &gt; 28 kg / m2 ) and should be applied in conjunction with an easily hy@@ po@@ kal@@ ine to fet@@ ated nutrition .
&quot; all of this may not be applied to children and young people under the age of 18 as they do not have sufficient data to effectiveness and security . &quot;
&quot; since Or@@ list@@ at however , there is only minimal res@@ or@@ ised , is necessary for elders and in patients with reduced life and / or kid@@ ney function no adjustment of dosage is necessary . &quot;
• Over@@ sensitivity to the substance or any other components • simultaneous treatment with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) • Chron@@ icle ( see section 4.6 ) • Still@@ time ( see section 4.6 ) • simultaneous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ als anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ anti@@ es ( see sections 4.5 and 4.8 )
the probability of insur@@ ed gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) can increase when all@@ i is taken along with a fat meal or fat @-@ rich nutrition .
&quot; as the weight reduction in diabetes are capable of diabetes with improved met@@ abo@@ lic control , patients who consult a medicine against diabetes , prior to start a therapy with all@@ i a doctor or pharmac@@ ists , because the dosage may be adapted to anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic . &quot;
patients who take all@@ i as well as drugs against hyper@@ tension or an increased cholesterol levels should take their doctor or pharmac@@ ists whether the dosage has to be adapted to these medicines .
&quot; it is recommended , additional pregnant measures to meet in the case of severe di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea possible failure of the or@@ al contradiction ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
both in a study on inter@@ actions of drugs as well as in several cases with simultaneous application of Or@@ list@@ at and Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in was observed a deport@@ ation of the Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in @-@ Plas@@ mas@@ room .
&quot; in the application of war@@ nings or other or@@ als anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ anti@@ es in combination with Or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ values ( international norm@@ alization R@@ atio , IN@@ R ) are influenced ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in most patients that were treated in clinical studies up to 4 full years with Or@@ list@@ at , the concent@@ rations of vitamins A , D , E , and K , as well as the beta car@@ ot@@ ins in the standardi@@ zation range . &quot;
&quot; however , the patients should be recommended before bed@@ time a supplement to the mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement to ensure sufficient vitality intake ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the gift of an Ein@@ mal@@ osis A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on , for a limited number of healthy volunteers , who received at the same time Or@@ list@@ at , a small decrease of the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on @-@ Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ cology . &quot;
&quot; experim@@ ental studies showed no direct or indirect impact on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the side effects of Or@@ list@@ at are mainly gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal Nature and hang together with the pharma@@ cological effect of the drug , as the absor@@ ption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented . &quot;
gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal effects were obtained from clinical trials with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally slightly and temporary .
&quot; frequencies are defined as follows : very frequently ( &gt; 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( incidence based on the available data is not estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of known side effects , which were established after the launch of Or@@ list@@ at is not known , since these events are voluntary sur@@ rendered by a population un@@ certain size . &quot;
† It is plau@@ si@@ bly that treatment with all@@ i with regard to possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal side effects can lead .

&quot; in the majority of the reported cases of Or@@ list@@ at remains , either side effects or similar side @-@ effects such as at recommended dose of Or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on investigations on man and animal can be attributed to a fast retreat , system@@ ic effects which may be attributed to the li@@ mbs characteristics of Or@@ list@@ at . &quot;

&quot; primary parameters , the change of body weight compared to the starting point ( at the time of the bound@@ ary ) , was rated as follows : as changing the body weight in study ( table 1 ) and as percentage of those study participants , which have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their output ( table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although in both studies the weight reduction have been observed over 12 months , the largest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average change in the overall cholesterol was with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.7 % ( output 5.6 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( output value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

Alo@@ xi is used in chemotherapy and vom@@ iting ( like Cis@@ co@@ atin ) as well as in chemotherapy ( such as Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , D@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or Carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids ( a drug which can be used as anti@@ em@@ e@@ tic ) .
the application for patients under the age of 18 is not recommended as to the effects in this age group is not enough information .
&quot; this means that the substance of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ otonin ) , to the recep@@ tors in the intest@@ ine . &quot;
Alo@@ xi has been studied in three main studies on 1 842 adults who received the chemotherapy and vom@@ iting for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting .
&quot; in chemotherapy , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting were reported 59 % of patients who have been treated with Alo@@ xi in the 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of the patients with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron , patients ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; in chemotherapy , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting are , showed 81 % of patients who have been treated with Alo@@ xi in the 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron , patients ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
when compared with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values are 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
March 2005 the European Commission announced the company Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharm@@ ac@@ euticals Ltd . a permit for the entry of Alo@@ xi throughout the European Union .
Alo@@ xi is index@@ es : for prevention of ev@@ ac@@ uation and vom@@ iting at strongly em@@ eto@@ gen@@ er chemotherapy because of cancer prevention and vom@@ iting at moder@@ nity em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
&quot; the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi to prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , which is induc@@ es by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be reinforced by adding one in front of chemotherapy Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids . &quot;

&quot; results of studies with moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy products are summar@@ ized in the following tables . &quot;
in clinical trials for indications chemotherapy chemotherapy and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) were the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and E@@ KG parameters , including the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ Inter@@ v@@ alls with the corresponding effects of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; according to the fertili@@ zer , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the stakeholders involved in vent@@ ric@@ ular defic@@ its and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation involved and extend the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the goal of the study conducted at 221 healthy Pro@@ dig@@ its study was the assessment of the E@@ KG effects of i@@ .v@@ . administ@@ ered Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in individual cases of 0,@@ 25 , 0,@@ 75 and 2,@@ 25 mg . &quot;
Res@@ or@@ ption to intra@@ ven@@ ous g@@ abe follows an initi@@ ating decrease in the plastic @-@ concent@@ rations a slow Eli@@ mination from the body with an average dead@@ lines of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plas@@ mak@@ on@@ concentration ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the concentration @-@ time @-@ cur@@ ve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally in the entire dosage range from 0,@@ 3@@ - 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer dos@@ ed dos@@ is@@ propor@@ tional .
&quot; after intra@@ ven@@ ous g@@ abe of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 cans , which was at 11 Ho@@ den@@ car@@ cin@@ oma patients between day 1 and day 5 common ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron @-@ Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ concentration at 42 ± 34 % . &quot;
&quot; from pharma@@ co@@ c@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations , that the total intra@@ ven@@ ous placement of 0,@@ 25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron reached full ex@@ position ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) , which was compared to a unique intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of 0,@@ 75 mg ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) , however , the C@@ max after the entry of 0,@@ 75 mg was higher . &quot;
&quot; about 40 % will be eliminated by the kid@@ neys , and roughly 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ abo@@ li@@ zation , which in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recep@@ tor . &quot;
&quot; in @-@ vit@@ ro studies on Met@@ abol@@ isation have shown that CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in lower dimensions , the I@@ so@@ enzy@@ me CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 at Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are involved . &quot;
&quot; Eli@@ mination After a intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the ur@@ ine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron made approximately 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
after a unique intra@@ ven@@ ous bol@@ ts at healthy was the overall physical activity 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
&quot; indeed , in patients with severe liver inter@@ rup@@ ture the termin@@ al Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ alb@@ eit and the average systematic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , however , a reduction in the dosage is not justified . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , effects have been observed only after exposure to be considered adequate across the maximum human@@ istic exposure , which indicates a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 From pre@@ clinical trials are hin@@ ts that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block in very high concent@@ rations of I@@ on@@ enk@@ ins channels , which can extend at the vent@@ ric@@ ular De@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; high d@@ oses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( every dose which were given in about the 30@@ fa@@ chen of the therapeutic Ex@@ posure in humans ) , which were given daily over two years , resulted in a multip@@ licity of liver , pit@@ uit@@ ary Neoplas@@ ticism ( in thy@@ ro@@ id , pit@@ uit@@ ary , p@@ anc@@ ers , p@@ ank@@ as@@ mark ) and skin tum@@ ors at rats , but not on mi@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not completely known , but due to the used high d@@ si@@ can and since Alo@@ xi upon a unique application , the relevance of these results is evaluated as for the people . &quot;

June 2006 the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ nei@@ ra ( CH@@ MP ) passed a neg@@ atives in which the failure of the approval of hep@@ atitis C intended for the treatment of hep@@ atitis C intended for the treatment of hep@@ atitis C approved by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml inj@@ ection solution .
&quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon is similar to a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same arz@@ az@@ ing effective component , which is already approved in the EU ( also &quot; Reference recumbent ) . &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hep@@ atitis C ( one by a virus infection ) .

&quot; it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which stimul@@ ates this to the formation of the drug . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon has provided data that compare the comparison of al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and pur@@ ity of the drug , efficiency , safety and effectiveness of hep@@ atitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of patients with hep@@ atitis C , the effectiveness of al@@ ph@@ eon has been compared with the effectiveness of the reference purposes by means of 455 patients . &quot;
the study was measured how many patients after 12 of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after setting the treatment to the drug languages ( i.e. no signs of the virus in blood ) .

&quot; furthermore , concerns have been expressed concerns , that the data on the stability of the drug and the market@@ ed medication have not been in@@ sufficient . &quot;
&quot; the number of patients with hep@@ atitis C , which resulted in the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in clinical study . &quot;
&quot; after setting the treatment with al@@ ph@@ eon Fl@@ amed the disease in more patients again than with the reference means , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from this , the test was dis@@ solved in the study on the investigation of the question , in@@ wi@@ ew@@ eit the drug is an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins against drug ) , not adequ@@ ately vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it can be used for the treatment of Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( one with cru@@ ising infection ) and small in@@ infected laz@@ er@@ ations ( risk or cutting ) , sc@@ r@@ ences and se@@ ams wo@@ unds . &quot;
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been veri@@ fied or pres@@ um@@ ably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant st@@ ap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us aur@@ eus ( MR@@ SA ) because Al@@ ar@@ go against this type of infections may not affect .
&quot; al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under the age of 18 may not be more than 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient is not referred to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by block@@ ade the bacter@@ ial re@@ bos@@ om@@ es ( the parts of the bacter@@ ial cells in which proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bited the growth of bacteria .
&quot; the effectiveness of the effectiveness was in all five studies of the share of patients , whose infection ended after the end of the treatment . &quot;
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go und 37 ( 5@@ 2.7 % ) of 71 patients under plac@@ ebo languages on treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected systems , al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ exin similar to advise : when the results of both studies were taken together at Hau@@ dates , talked about 90 % of the patients of both groups on the treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies were noted that al@@ tar@@ go in the treatment of ab@@ sz@@ essen , or by infections that have been veri@@ fied or probably caused by MR@@ SA were not effective enough . &quot;
the most common side @-@ effect with al@@ tar@@ go ( which has been observed for 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation at the contract place .
&quot; the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ az@@ ate ( CH@@ MP ) suffered at the conclusion that the benefits of al@@ tar@@ go on the short @-@ term treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections towards the risks over@@ weig@@ h : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • in@@ fied small laz@@ iness , ch@@ opped or par@@ aly@@ zed wo@@ unds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission of the G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd is responsible for approval by Al@@ tar@@ go in the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; patients , in which two or three days is not showing an improvement within two or three days , should be considered once more and an alternative therapy is being considered ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a sensi@@ tiz@@ ing or serious local irrit@@ ation by the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in Sal@@ be the treatment should be broken , the sal@@ be carefully ab@@ sent and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection . &quot;
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in should not be applied to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as in@@ re@@ ger or susp@@ ected ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; clinical studies in clinical studies were the effectiveness of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in in patients with infections , which were caused by a meth@@ odology @-@ resistant st@@ ap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us aur@@ eus ( MR@@ SA ) were in@@ sufficient . &quot;
&quot; an alternative therapy is to be considered , if after a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected ones occurs . &quot;
the effect of simultaneous application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in and other top@@ ical means on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical drug is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plas@@ tic@@ ular concent@@ rations , which have been reached by people after top@@ ical application on cur@@ ed skin or infected super@@ ficial wo@@ unds , is a clin@@ ically relevant im@@ itation in vi@@ vo not to expect ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
3 After the simultaneous image of 2 @-@ times daily 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the average ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in sal@@ be on ab@@ ed skin of healthy adult men around 81 % .
&quot; due to the low system@@ ic exposure to top@@ ical application in patients , Dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tations are not considered to be used when top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in during a system@@ ic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a re@@ productions after or@@ al intake and are in@@ adequate in terms of a statement on the birth and the laz@@ y / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in Sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacter@@ ial therapy is clearly indi@@ visible and the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in the gift of a system @-@ system antibiotic is prefer@@ able .
&quot; when deciding whether the breast@@ feeding continues / ends , or the therapy with al@@ tar@@ go will continue to be termin@@ ated , is between the benefits of breast and the benefit of al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , the al@@ tar@@ go was applied , the most commonly reported tri@@ rit@@ ation at the administration of origin , which considered about 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; saving ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in is a semi @-@ synthe@@ tic der@@ iv@@ atives of Ple@@ uro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fer@@ mentation from C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ otus pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
the Wir@@ km@@ echan@@ mechanism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in is based on sel@@ ective sh@@ iel@@ ding of bacter@@ ial protein synthesis by interaction with a particular leg unit des bacter@@ ial Ri@@ bos@@ om that diff@@ ers from the barrier to other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ ag@@ ni@@ cal anti@@ bacter@@ ial fabrics .
data point out that the B@@ ind@@ om@@ al Protein L@@ 3 involves and in the region of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ als P @-@ B@@ ind@@ est@@ ral and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ as@@ e@@ Centre .

&quot; on the basis of the local pre@@ valence of resistance , the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in at least some inf@@ ectious forms appear , should be a consultation by experts . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in the In @-@ vit@@ ro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in compared to S.@@ aur@@ eus , ir@@ respective of whether the isolation are sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ illin . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a non @-@ speaking to treatment at S.@@ aur@@ eus , the presence of tribes should be considered with additional vi@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults became 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in Sal@@ be daily under oc@@ clusion on intact and on f@@ aded skin for up to 7 days .
&quot; from 516 patients ( adults and children ) , which received 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for top@@ ical treatment of secondary trau@@ mati@@ cal wo@@ unds , were obtained single plastic map@@ le grapes . &quot;
the samp@@ ling took place in the days 3 or 4 in the adult patients respectively in front of the medi@@ ation and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however the maximum individual system@@ ic shot at the people after top@@ ical application of 1 % sal@@ be on 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ max = 22 x / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng · h / ml ) 660 @-@ times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ ul@@ ul@@ in IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP inhal@@ ation .

&quot; in studies for or@@ als toxic@@ ity to rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and shield changes . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is used for protection against hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B ( diseases which concern the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years that are not imm@@ un against these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is applied in the framework of one of two cans of existing vacc@@ ines , whereby protection against hep@@ atitis B may only be achieved after administration of the second dose . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix must be used only if the immun@@ ization is a low risk of hep@@ atitis B infection and is ensured that consisting of two cans with existing vacc@@ ination can be led to an end . &quot;
if a re@@ fres@@ her dose against hep@@ atitis A or B is desired , Ambi@@ rix or another hep@@ atitis C or B vaccine can be given . &quot;
vacc@@ ines work by bringing the immune system ( the natural resistance of the body ) . &quot;
&quot; after having received a child the vaccine , the immune system realis@@ es the viruses and surface of the surface as &quot; foreign &quot; and generates antibodies against it . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as since 1996 the vacc@@ ines Twin@@ rix adults and since 1997 approved the Twin@@ rix Children .
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are applied to the protection against the same disease , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administ@@ ered within three d@@ oses of existing vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adult identical ingredients were included , some of the data that supports the use of Twin@@ rix adults , also used as a letter for application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the main index@@ ator for the eff@@ ic@@ acy was the share of vacc@@ in@@ ated children , which had developed a month after the last inj@@ ection of anti @-@ de@@ centr@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study with 208 children , the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared to a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix resulted in between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ in@@ ated children a month after the last inj@@ ection of the development of hep@@ atitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the level of protection from Ambi@@ rix was similar to six @-@ month and at a 12 @-@ month distance between inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 of 10 vacc@@ ines ) are head@@ ache , Ap@@ pe@@ tit@@ man@@ gel , pain@@ s at inj@@ ection , red@@ ness , mat@@ ernity ( ti@@ red@@ ness ) and irrit@@ ability . &quot;
ambi@@ rix is allowed to react in patients that may be over@@ sensi@@ tively ( allergic ) react to the agents , one of the other ingredients or Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) , not being applied . &quot;
August 2002 adopted the European Commission for the G@@ lax@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ icals s.@@ a. a permit for the transport of ambi@@ rix in the whole
the standardi@@ zation plan for the Grun@@ dim@@ mun@@ ization with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose of the choice and the second dose is administ@@ ered for the first dose between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a re@@ plac@@ eable must be desired for hep@@ atitis A as well as for hep@@ atitis B , can be vacc@@ in@@ ated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ous vacc@@ ines or with a combination . &quot;
the anti @-@ hep@@ at@@ mun@@ ization with the combination of anti @-@ hep@@ atitis sound ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ hep@@ atitis A @-@ virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) anti @-@ virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) anti @-@ virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ous vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is still not completely secured , whether immun@@ om@@ itable individuals who have addressed to a Hepatitis A@@ - vacc@@ ination , since they are also protected at no longer refer@@ able antibodies . &quot;
3 How in all inj@@ ections should be the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lak@@ tic reaction after the gift of the vaccine such opportunities for medical treatment and supervision should always be available immediately .
&quot; if a fast protection against hep@@ atitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended with the combination simp@@ lic@@ ent , the 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B @-@ surface . &quot;
&quot; at her@@ edi@@ aly@@ sis and persons with dist@@ urbances of the immune system , under circumstances no sufficient Anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs @-@ antibodies can be achieved , so in these cases the gift of other imp@@ etus can be required . &quot;
&quot; because a intra@@ der@@ mal inj@@ ection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular appointments could lead to a subtle vacc@@ ination , should be avoided these inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; in Tor@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ top@@ en@@ ie or blood circulation disorders , Ambi@@ rix can be con@@ stitut@@ ed sub@@ cut@@ aneous sub@@ cut@@ aneous since it can occur in these cases according to in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular species . &quot;
if Ambi@@ rix in the second life year in the form of a separated inj@@ ection , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular Poli@@ om@@ yel@@ i@@ tis@@ - , in@@ activation ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / hi@@ b ) or with a combined masks ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / hi@@ b ) or with a combined mas@@ ex @-@ vaccine vaccine was administ@@ ered , was the immune response to all anti@@ gens adequ@@ ately ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune def@@ ects must be considered , that possibly no sufficient immune response is achieved . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study involving 3 imp@@ lication of these wor@@ ding in adults , the incidence of pain , red@@ ness , sw@@ elling , gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ itis , head@@ aches and fever comparable to the incidence that was observed during the former Thi@@ omer@@ sal@@ - and preser@@ v@@ ative vacc@@ ination . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , 20@@ 29 Imp@@ fd@@ oses Ambi@@ rix had a total of 10@@ 27 imp@@ aired in the age of 1 to including 15 years . &quot;
in a study with 300 participants in the age of 12 and including 15 years the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix has been compared to the 3 @-@ d@@ oses of combination .
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and mat@@ ernity on a calculation basis per Imp@@ fd@@ osis Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person . &quot;
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.7 % of the Pro@@ ban@@ den , compared to 39.@@ 1 % in the propor@@ tions of a dose of 3 @-@ d@@ oses , combination . &quot;

&quot; the incidence of tool@@ fulness was however comparable ( i.e. about the entire vaccine cycle at 39,@@ 6 % of the Pro@@ ban@@ den , the Ambi@@ rix , compared with 36,@@ 2 % in the Pro@@ ban@@ den , which received the 3 @-@ d@@ oses @-@ combination com@@ f@@ eit ) . &quot;
the incidence pronounc@@ ed pain and mat@@ ality was small and comparable to that was observed after administration of the combination that was observed with the 3 @-@ d@@ oses of vacc@@ in@@ ema .
&quot; in a compar@@ ative study at 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year Imp@@ rec@@ ingen , the occur@@ rence of Lok@@ al@@ re@@ actions and general transactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group comparable to the associated with 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis A @-@ B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B @-@ surface . &quot;
&quot; but at 6@@ - to 11@@ - J@@ es , however , after vacc@@ ination with ambi@@ rix has been a frequent occur@@ rence of pain ( at the inj@@ ection ) per dose , not per sheet , reported . &quot;

&quot; hep@@ atitis A @-@ virus is usually transmitted by vi@@ ral food and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other ways , such as by bathing in through waste water contamin@@ ated waters . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark ur@@ ine , a flo@@ at face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( laughter ) and other symptoms that may possibly make a stationary treatment necessary . &quot;
as with all vacc@@ ines Ambi@@ rix not fully protect against an infection with hep@@ atitis C or Hepatitis B virus as well as the complete vaccine series with 2 d@@ oses has been completed .
if you are infected with your child before the administration of both vacc@@ ines Ambi@@ rix already infected with hep@@ atitis C or hep@@ atitis B @-@ B ( although you / your child can still feel uncomfortable or sick @-@ feel ) can not prevent a vaccine may not prevent any disorder .
&quot; protection against other infections that cause the liver damage or symptoms that are similar to whom after a hep@@ atitis , or hep@@ atitis B infection can not be taught . &quot;
• if you have an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can be expressed through ju@@ ck@@ ling skin attacks , respir@@ ation or sw@@ elling of the face or tongue . • if you have entered an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hep@@ atitis A or hep@@ atitis B . • If you have a serious infection with fever . &quot;
• if you want to have a protection against hep@@ atitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the usually intended administration of the second vacc@@ ination ) .
at a possible risk of infection with Hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination the doctor will advise you / your child of an imp@@ lication with ambi@@ rix .
&quot; instead , he will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hep@@ atitis C / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced sal@@ ary of effective components per Imp@@ fd@@ osis ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ active Hepatitis C @-@ C @-@ virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B @-@ surface ) . &quot;
the second vacc@@ ination of this vaccine with decreased removal of effective invent@@ ory is usually administ@@ ered a month after the first dose and may give you a vaccine in advance of ter@@ mination of the vaccine being .
&quot; sometimes ambi@@ rix is suffering from people who suffer from heavy blood circulation , under the skin and not in the muscle bl@@ ur . • if you are weak@@ ened to your child due to a disorder or treatment in your body @-@ own risk . &quot;
&quot; ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these persons can not be sufficient , so that a blood test can be necessary to see how strong the reaction to the vaccine is . &quot;
&quot; 21 If you have to take your doctor if you are taking other medicines , ( including those that you can get without wor@@ ding ) or if you have done without wor@@ ding or have been administ@@ ered or Im@@ m@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) , or this is planned in the near future . &quot;
but it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hep@@ atitis A and B viruses .
&quot; if another vaccine has to be given simultaneously with ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ in@@ ated in separate places and as possible as possible different li@@ mbs . &quot;
&quot; if ambi@@ rix should be administ@@ ered at the same time or shortly before or after an inj@@ ection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; usually Ambi@@ rix pregnancy or imp@@ ending women does not administ@@ er , except it is urgent to be vacc@@ in@@ ated both against hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B . &quot;
important information on certain other components from Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is available in Pack@@ ings to 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in pack@@ ets to 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; on the basis of the data , which has become known since the distribution of the first approval for the inci@@ dent , the CH@@ MP believes that the utility value for Ambi@@ rix is positive . &quot;
&quot; since Ambi@@ rix is only limited to a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data are limited for this medicine due to low patient position . &quot;
&quot; ammon@@ aps can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with in@@ complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ def@@ ect or hyper@@ tension ( brain injury , as a result of high ammon@@ ium concent@@ rations ) in the pre @-@ history . &quot;
&quot; ammon@@ aps is divided - split into several items from meals - swal@@ low@@ ed , under the food mixed or over a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ at@@ es@@ ie ( through the stomach hose ) , or a Nas@@ en@@ son@@ de ( through the nose in the stomach hose ) administ@@ ered . &quot;
it was not a compar@@ ative study since ammon@@ aps not to be compared to another treatment or with plac@@ ebo ( a hy@@ po@@ ised medication that could be compared without effects ) .
&quot; ammon@@ aps can also lead to ap@@ pe@@ tit@@ ation , an ab@@ normal aci@@ dity , irrit@@ ability , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , hydr@@ ation , hydr@@ ation , hydr@@ ation , hydr@@ ation , irrit@@ ation , irrit@@ ation , rash , rash or weight @-@ gain . &quot;
the committee for Human@@ arz@@ ta ( CH@@ MP ) suffered at the conclusion that ammon@@ aps in patients suffering from the ur@@ inary cycle to high ammon@@ ium values can be effective .
&quot; ammon@@ aps has been approved in &quot; extraordinary circumstances , &quot; as due to the rar@@ ity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information on this medicine . &quot;
&quot; the use is index@@ ed in all patients , in which a complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ man@@ gel already manifes@@ ts in the new@@ born age ( within the first 28 Leb@@ enst@@ age ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late manip@@ ulated form ( in@@ complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ def@@ ect that manifes@@ ts after the first life of life ) then there is an indication of the use when in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , there is a hyper@@ tension @-@ em@@ ic encephal@@ opath@@ y . &quot;
&quot; for inf@@ ants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with bats , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form . &quot;
&quot; the daily dose is individually calculated by the protein @-@ toler@@ ances and the growth and development of daily protein intake . &quot;
&quot; according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight about 20 kg as well as with flo@@ ck @-@ growing and adults . &quot;
&quot; in patients who suffer from a pre @-@ fixed lack of Carb@@ am@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ in@@ tran@@ sc@@ arb@@ am@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ lin or arg@@ in@@ ine in a dosage of 0,@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
patients with a Arg@@ in@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive arg@@ in@@ ine in a dosage from 0,@@ 4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS tablets are allowed to administ@@ er patients with bats , as a risk to the emergence of oil ag@@ us@@ ul@@ zer@@ a , if the tablets are not immediately going into the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ yr@@ at , which is the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; therefore , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS should therefore be used to treat patients with con@@ gesti@@ ble in@@ suffici@@ ency or severe kid@@ ney cancer and oil painting , with caution . &quot;
&quot; as Met@@ abol@@ ization and ex@@ cre@@ tion of Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ yr@@ at about the liver and the kid@@ neys , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS in patients with liver or kid@@ ney in@@ suffici@@ ency should be applied only with extreme caution . &quot;
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is unknown ; the use of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ sting ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; in sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate at young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) it came to a slow@@ ing of neur@@ onal pollution and an increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
it also found a delay of cerem@@ onial syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functional neur@@ ons in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be noticed whether phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate is reti@@ red at the people into the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS during the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
in clinical trials with AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS entered at 56 % of patients at least one undes@@ irable event ( AE ) and at 78 % of those undes@@ irable events that they did not stand with AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS .
&quot; frequency is defined as follows : very frequently ( &gt; 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic response to AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old an@@ or@@ ec@@ tic patient , which developed a met@@ abo@@ lic En@@ cephal@@ ia , severe hy@@ po@@ kal@@ ine , peri@@ ph@@ eral neuro@@ path@@ ia and pan@@ cre@@ atitis . &quot;
&quot; a fall of an over@@ hau@@ ling stood with a 5 month old to@@ dd@@ ler , with a vers@@ aries of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) . &quot;
these symptoms go to the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ at that showed up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ is@@ limited neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate is a met@@ abo@@ lic active connection that is con@@ stitut@@ ed by ac@@ et@@ y@@ elling with gl@@ ut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine con@@ ju@@ ks that is reti@@ red over the kid@@ neys .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ric@@ ally seen is phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine comparable ( both connections contain 2 nit@@ rogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine is therefore used as an alternative support for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of surplus nit@@ rogen .
5 patients with dist@@ urbances on ur@@ inary cycle may be assumed that for each gram@@ mar of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ yr@@ at between 0.12 and 0,15 g phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine @-@ nit@@ rogen .
&quot; it is of importance that the diagnosis is provided at an early stage and the treatment is immediately started to improve the survival of survival , and the clinical outcome . &quot;
&quot; the progn@@ osis of the ear@@ mani@@ gible form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in the new@@ born age was almost always inf@@ ant , and the disease led even in treating with per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , or with their stuff@@ y @-@ free analog@@ a within the first life year to death . &quot;
&quot; by her@@ edi@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nit@@ rogen cre@@ tion ( Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ at ) , fisher@@ ri@@ um@@ ben@@ zo@@ at and so@@ stitution of essential amino acids was it possible to increase the survival rate of new bor@@ ns at post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first life of life ) diagnosed in 80 % . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose disease has been diagnosed in the course of pregnancy , and the survival rates were treated against 100 % , but even in these patients it came with time with many to spiritual disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late manip@@ ulated form of the disease ( including female patients with the heter@@ ogen@@ ic encephal@@ y Man@@ gels ) , which were recovered from a hyper@@ ammon@@ ite encephal@@ opath@@ y and after that permanently with Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ yr@@ at and a fisher@@ y diet were treated , was the survival rate 98 % . &quot;
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are also hardly reversible and in some patients may occur a further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ logical jurisdiction .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ yr@@ at to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ at is oxi@@ fies , which is based in liver and kid@@ ney enz@@ ym@@ atic with gl@@ ut@@ amine con@@ ju@@ ine , with phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine . &quot;

the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ abo@@ lic was also examined for canc@@ ers after intra@@ ven@@ ous g@@ abe from Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ at .
after a oral sol@@ d@@ osis of 5 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ yr@@ at in tablet form were established 15 minutes after taking measur@@ able plastic @-@ concent@@ rations of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ yr@@ at .
&quot; in the majority of patients with urea @-@ cl@@ esi@@ ans or her@@ o@@ glob@@ in@@ opath@@ ies , according to different cans of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) next morning , not a phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate in the plas@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis which were repeated with Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three single beds ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ at@@ concent@@ rations in the plas@@ mas@@ on was higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
&quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is made within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ ated product Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine over the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; after the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us testing , Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ yr@@ at with toxic and non @-@ toxic d@@ oses treated with toxic substances ( examination 24 and 48 h after administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS gran@@ ules shall either be taken or@@ ally ( inf@@ ants and children , who can still have no tablets , or patients with eggs , or a Nas@@ en@@ son@@ de . &quot;
&quot; according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight about 20 kg as well as with flo@@ ck @-@ growing and adults . &quot;
&quot; ammonia concentration , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( in particular bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , carnit@@ ine and ser@@ um@@ proteins in plas@@ ma should be held within the normal range . &quot;
&quot; in patients who suffer from a pre @-@ fixed lack of Carb@@ am@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ in@@ tran@@ sc@@ arb@@ am@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ lin or arg@@ in@@ ine in a dosage of 0,@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day . &quot;

&quot; when R@@ atten@@ f@@ utes were exposed to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate ( active met@@ abo@@ lit by phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ yr@@ at ) , there came to shops in the pyramid cells of the deer . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic response to AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old an@@ or@@ ec@@ tic patient , which developed a met@@ abo@@ lic En@@ cephal@@ ia , severe hy@@ po@@ kal@@ ine , peri@@ ph@@ eral neuro@@ path@@ ia and pan@@ cre@@ atitis . &quot;

on the basis of studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine in patients with disorders of ur@@ inary cycle may be assumed that for each gram@@ mar of nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ yr@@ at between 0.12 and 0,15 g phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine @-@ nit@@ rogen .

&quot; an@@ gi@@ ox is used for treating adult patients with &quot; ac@@ ute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ ms &quot; ( ACS , decreased blood intake to the heart ) , for example , in inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ inf@@ arkt ( heart attack ) without &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ ung &quot; ( an an@@ om@@ al measurement value at the electro@@ cardi@@ olog@@ ram or E@@ KG ) . &quot;
will Angi@@ ox in preventing blood cl@@ auses in patients being applied to a PCI is administ@@ ered and the in@@ fusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure .
this can contribute to patients with Ang@@ ina or heart attack on maintaining the blood flow and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; about 14 000 patients took part in the capit@@ ols over the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of an@@ gi@@ ox in all@@ ot@@ or in connection with a gly@@ co@@ red @-@ I@@ I@@ b / I@@ I@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( GP@@ I , a different drug for preventing blood cl@@ ans ) and a GP@@ I was compared . &quot;
&quot; while PCI was often used a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the arter@@ ies , to prevent a cl@@ uster ) , and they also received other medicines for preventing blood cl@@ auses , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
in the treatment of ACS was Angi@@ ox - with or without gift from GP@@ I - in preventing the new events ( death cases or re@@ vas@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation ) after 30 days or a year just as effective as the traditional treatment .
&quot; in patients who subj@@ ected to a PCI , an@@ gi@@ ox in terms of all indicators was just as effective as Hep@@ arin , except in severe blood vessels , where it was clearly more effective than Hep@@ arin . &quot;
an@@ gi@@ ox should not be used in patients who may be over@@ sensi@@ tively ( allergic ) against b@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , other Hi@@ ru@@ dine or one of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; it may not be applied to patients who have recently had a blood circulation , as well as with people with rigi@@ ble hyper@@ tension or severe kid@@ ney issues , or a heart infection . &quot;
the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ nei@@ ra ( CH@@ MP ) gel@@ te to the conclusion that an@@ gi@@ ox in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI is a acceptable replacement for Hep@@ arin .
September 2004 the European Commission opened the Company The Medi@@ c@@ ines Company UK Ltd. a licence for the transport of an@@ gi@@ ox in the whole European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with ac@@ ute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ men ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non - ST @-@ Heb@@ eisen ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) when a timely intervention is provided .
the recommended Initi@@ ald@@ osis of Angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intra@@ ven@@ ous bol@@ us@@ ement of 0,1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0,@@ 25 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; if the patient is carried out in another consequence , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg is given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the operation on 1,@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; after PCI , the use of clinical requirements are reduced to the reduced Inf@@ usion@@ sd@@ osis from 0,@@ 25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg will be administ@@ ered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1,@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the Rhin@@ oplast@@ y . &quot;
the recommended dosage of Angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initi@@ als intra@@ ven@@ ous bol@@ us@@ ation of 0,@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and an immediate immediately subsequent in@@ fusion with a dose of 1,@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the operation . &quot;
the safety and eff@@ ic@@ acy of a couple of Bol@@ us @-@ G@@ abe von Angi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned .
&quot; this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shor@@ ten@@ ed under 225 seconds , a second bolt from 0,@@ 3 mg / kg / body weight . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the occur@@ rence of lower ACT levels , the constitu@@ ent and th@@ inner medicinal products should be in@@ sufficient prior to the application , and the Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis will be administ@@ ered quickly intra@@ ven@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT amounts more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided that 1,@@ 75 mg / kg Inf@@ usion@@ sd@@ osis will be properly administ@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; in patients with medium @-@ severe kid@@ ney attri@@ bute ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which treated an PCI ( whether with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din against ACS or not ) , should be used a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h . &quot;
the ACT @-@ value under 225 seconds is a second bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis of 0.3 mg / kg to administ@@ er and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis .
&quot; in patients with medium @-@ severe kid@@ ney damage , included in phase I@@ I@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ study ( replace @-@ 2 ) which was included in the ACT , was the ACT value 5 minutes after the gift of the b@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without Dos@@ age with an average of 366 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 The patients with severe kid@@ neys ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ st patients is Angi@@ ox contra@@ indications ( see under section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with an@@ gi@@ ox can be guided 30 minutes after ter@@ mination of intra@@ ven@@ ous G@@ abe from un@@ f@@ rak@@ ted hep@@ arin or 8 hours after the end of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous G@@ abe from the molecular Hep@@ arin .
• more known hyper@@ sensitivity to the substance or any other components or against Hi@@ ru@@ dine • active blo@@ cking blood risk . • heavy un@@ controll@@ able hyper@@ tension and sub@@ contrac@@ eption . • heavy duty damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis patient
patients are carefully observed during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of a blood flow especially when Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is administ@@ ered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; even if in PCI @-@ patients under Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din most of the ble@@ eding to arter@@ ial scores occur , can occur in patients who occur in a per@@ k@@ ut@@ ans Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ intervention ( PCI ) during treatment in principle everywhere ble@@ eding . &quot;
&quot; in patients , the war@@ nings have been treated and treated with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , should be considered to ensure that the value of treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din will again be achieved before the treatment existing level . &quot;

&quot; Ap@@ id@@ ra is used for the treatment of adults , adoles@@ cents and children aged six years with diabetes that need treatment with insu@@ lin . &quot;
&quot; Ap@@ id@@ ra is sub@@ cut@@ ted ( under the skin ) to the ab@@ dom@@ inal , the thig@@ h or the upper arm inj@@ ured or as an continu@@ in@@ fusion with an insu@@ lin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insu@@ lin to regul@@ ating glu@@ cose levels ( sugar ) in the blood or may not process the insu@@ lin .
&quot; In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in is very different from human insu@@ lin , and the change means that it seems faster and a shorter active period has more than a short @-@ acting Human@@ insu@@ lin . &quot;
&quot; Ap@@ id@@ ra was used in combination with a long @-@ effective insu@@ lin in patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes , in which the body can not produce insu@@ lin in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged four to 17 years . &quot;
&quot; in case of type @-@ 2 diabetes , in which the body In@@ su@@ lin can not be eff@@ ected effectively , Ap@@ id@@ ra was investigated in a study with 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
&quot; the main index@@ ator for the eff@@ ic@@ acy was the amend@@ ment to concentration of substance gly@@ co@@ li@@ li@@ ed hem@@ ost@@ glob@@ ine ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , which shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
in the first study with adults with type @-@ 1 diabetes was reduced by 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % at In@@ su@@ lin@@ lis@@ pro .
in adults with type @-@ 2 diabetes was the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration 0.@@ 46 % after six months with Ap@@ id@@ ra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human Nor@@ mal@@ insu@@ lin .
&quot; Ap@@ id@@ ra must not be applied in patients who are potentially over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or one of the other components , or in patients who already suffer from a hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; the d@@ oses of Ap@@ id@@ ra must be adapted , if it is administ@@ ered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood@@ stream seal . &quot;
September 2004 the European Commission of the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ atar Germany GmbH is a licence for the transport of Ap@@ id@@ ra in the entire European Union .
Ap@@ id@@ ra is a sub@@ cut@@ aneous inj@@ ection either in the area of pan@@ cre@@ ep or the Del@@ tam@@ c &apos;s stomach or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous in@@ fusion in the field of pan@@ cre@@ ams .
&quot; due to the reduced glu@@ e@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and the dimin@@ ishing insu@@ lat@@ ors , the insu@@ lin can be her@@ ed in patients with a restriction of the liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of the effects , the trademark ( Her@@ - ant ) , the insu@@ lin type ( normal , n@@ ph , cin@@ emas , etc . ) , the type of insu@@ lin ( animal insu@@ lin ) , and / or the manufacturing method can move a change in the insu@@ lin delivery . &quot;
&quot; 3 A in@@ adequate dosage or the break@@ age of treatment , especially in patients with an insu@@ lin diabetes , may lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and a di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ ment ; these states are potentially life @-@ threat@@ ening . &quot;
switching to a patient on another insu@@ lin type or insu@@ lin of another manufacturer should take place under stric@@ ter physician supervision and may make a change of dosage required .
&quot; the timing of a hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia is dependent on the effects of the In@@ su@@ line , and can therefore change from the conversion of the treatment schem@@ as . &quot;
&quot; to the substances which can increase blood circulation levels and increase the incl@@ ination to hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ ka , an@@ op@@ y@@ ram@@ id , Fi@@ br@@ y@@ ram@@ id , Fi@@ br@@ y@@ ram@@ id , Fi@@ br@@ y@@ yll@@ ands , Fi@@ cht@@ el@@ yll@@ in , Pro@@ po@@ x@@ yp@@ hs , S@@ aliz@@ yl@@ ate and Sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , among the effect of sympath@@ oly@@ ors like bet@@ ab@@ lock@@ ers , Cl@@ oni@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ i@@ din and Reser@@ pin the symptoms of in@@ ep@@ an@@ ine @-@ regulation can be weak@@ ened or missing . &quot;
&quot; animal experim@@ ental studies for reproductive medicine showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and Human@@ insu@@ lin in terms of pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether in@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ enters into the human mother &apos;s milk , but in general insu@@ lin appears neither into the mother &apos;s milk , nor will it res@@ ort@@ ed according to oral application . &quot;
&quot; in the following , those of clinical trials are listed , group@@ ed according to system organs ( very common : &gt; 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally : &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency on the basis of the availability of the availability ) . &quot;

severe hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ bodies with consciousness can be given by a in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous inj@@ ection of glu@@ cose ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) which is given by a appropri@@ ately trained person or treated by an intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of glu@@ cose v@@ ents by a doctor .
&quot; according to a glu@@ cose subject , the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to determine the jud@@ gement of the severe hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insu@@ lin sen@@ kt the blood sugar levels by the stimulation of peri@@ ph@@ al glu@@ cose levels ( especially by sk@@ elet@@ on muscles and fat ) as well as by the in@@ hibition of glu@@ cose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes are shown that in sub@@ cut@@ able Ga@@ - be done by In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the effects occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than at hu@@ - man@@ em Nor@@ mal@@ insu@@ lin .
&quot; in a study with 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type @-@ 1 diabetes , tu@@ s showed In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in in the therapeutic value of the intest@@ inal glu@@ cose levels , and at 0,@@ 3 E / kg or more a dis@@ proportion@@ ate increase of glu@@ cose organs , just like human@@ insu@@ lin . &quot;
In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a twice as quick effects as norm@@ ales Human@@ insu@@ lin and achiev@@ es the complete glu@@ cose effect about 2 hours earlier than Human@@ insu@@ lin .
&quot; the data was clear that in an application of In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal is a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ale gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control , the 30 minutes before the meal is given . &quot;
&quot; In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal was founded , a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ale control was given as with human@@ eness Nor@@ mal@@ insu@@ lin , which was 2 minutes before the meal was reached . &quot;
&quot; In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 15 minutes after the start of the meal is wast@@ ed , a comparable gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic control , such as with human@@ eness Nor@@ mal@@ insu@@ lin , which is given 2 Mi@@ - gro@@ ov@@ es before the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) . &quot;
In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at G@@ abe 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - previously ) before the start of the meal ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before the start of the meal ( figure 1A ) as well as compared to human@@ istic Nor@@ mal@@ insu@@ lin that was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - previously ) before a meal ( figure 1@@ B ) .
In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at G@@ abe 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - after the start of the meal in comparison to human standards - mal@@ insu@@ lin , which was 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - previously ) before the start of the meal ( figure 1C ) . &quot;
