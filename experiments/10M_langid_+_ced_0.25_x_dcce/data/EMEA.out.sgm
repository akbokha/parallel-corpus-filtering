<seg id="7">Injection solution will be applied to a fast control of gesture unrest or behavioural disorder when the oral intake of drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both diseases, the solution can take a solution or the melting tumor in patients may be applied to the glow of tablets difficulties."</seg>

<seg id="10">"this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells through" neurotransmitters, i.e. chemical substances that allow communication of nerve cells to each other. "</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol probably appears mainly as "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydro-yptamine (also serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazol like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in less measures than the neurotransmitter affects the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"since dopamine and 5-hydro tryptamin with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder played a role to normalize Aripiprazol to normalize the activity of the brain, causing psychotic or manic symptoms and prevent their re-occur."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the effectiveness of Abilify, the re-emergence of the symptoms, was examined in three studies over up to one year."</seg>

<seg id="23">"Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg-cans, also decreased effectively as placebo the symptoms gested unrest and were similar to Lorazepam."</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify to take (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidale disorders, headache (twilight), fatigue and exhaustion (increased memory), fatigue and exhaustion, ohelplessness, Insomnia, Insomnia (sleep dysfunction) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Committee for Humanarzazate (CHMP) suffered at the conclusion that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and of medium to severe manic episode in patients, which had predominantly diary episodes on treatment with Aripiprazol said to overweigh the risks."</seg>
