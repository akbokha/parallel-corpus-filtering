the package &amp; package ; contains several modules for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size they offer some additional functions and simpli@@ fy the use of some features of con@@ quer@@ or ; by using this easier .
further information about using &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ;
&quot; to load these modules in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select the Settings menu .... Open the map card tools and choose the desired modules . &quot;
&quot; this is a list of default settings from the package k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that any more modules are installed on your system , if you have additional software installed . &quot;
you should install the package base that contains the con@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
&quot; to use the crash module , click on the kon@@ quer@@ or ; on extras . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for crash , if available , delete . &quot;
the module super@@ visory filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under extras filter . with the module you can &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s up @-@ to @-@ date working directory on different kind of filter .
&quot; in order to view the DO@@ M construction view in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; then open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently shown website . as default , the display starts with the roots of the document , example : document@@ aries , all other kn@@ ots are sub@@ elements of this roots . &quot;
&quot; the module &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; for &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; represents another view of objects with the M@@ IME type I@@ node / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative to the different symbol@@ ism and text views , in order to view the content of your local file system . &quot;
&quot; the distinctive feature of &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; consists of a rect@@ angle @-@ called Ord@@ n@@ arch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map . tree maps allow the size of the size of objects in wel@@ ded structures . this size needs to possess propor@@ tional to its size , the size of the size of the sub@@ ordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; at &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; reflects the size of a file or a folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . therefore , &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; it can be seen as a graphic and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; is an entry in the Tre@@ vor @-@ depic@@ tion a rect@@ angle , which represents a file or a folder in your fil@@ es@@ ystem . for the simpl@@ est navigation possess the right @-@ color colour@@ fast@@ ening and lab@@ eled settings . &quot;
&quot; the colour of a rect@@ angle , which will be swit@@ ched over colour mode , can be either depth for easy recognition of wear @-@ depth or the image of a different file name such as name , owners , group or M@@ IME type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can set up with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property you may specify whether they are displayed at all , only if enough space to display is available or if the area of sub@@ ordin@@ ate rect@@ angle may appear . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the lab@@ eling in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; in the display algorith@@ ms for Tre@@ em@@ aps should usually be respected that the area is propor@@ tional to the size of the item . when Tre@@ vor in &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; this goal is not always respected . note that no more space is lost for frames when the rect@@ angle square is lost . &quot;
&quot; as sharing the area of an entry for the sub@@ ordin@@ ate entries , the implementation is left . here it is applicable to the lab@@ eled and to prevent placement ten@@ ded by setting up space , that law@@ yer are emerging , the best methods for this are lines , columns or recur@@ sive two . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minimal set of the area for an entry via the menu item . instead , a rob@@ ber pattern is drawn into the area of the over@@ ordered item , to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a sub@@ ordin@@ ate entry . &quot;
&quot; originally &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction into the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets , which was developed for the use of K@@ C@@ ach@@ are@@ ind . &quot;
the module picture gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Ex@@ tras pictur@@ galerie ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .

&quot; a simple and user @-@ contact camera is made available to you , so that you can download with your digital camera and support your photos directly in &amp; D . naturally , every medium and every card reader will be supported by your operating system , which will be supported by your operating system . &quot;
&quot; Management came ; includes a fast image processing with basic training tools . you can use these to review your photos , comment , to evaluate and correct . the mach@@ ining abilities can be easily expanded with KDE Image Plugins Interface ( manual ) modules easily . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; D came ; easy to use , it provides frag@@ mentary professional skills . it works completely in the 16 @-@ bit Far@@ br@@ aum and all available modules support the raw materials through li@@ bra@@ w , DN@@ G @-@ Export and ICC @-@ colour @-@ colour work@@ flow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more met@@ ad@@ ata , such as &amp; eg ; about the camera or the lin@@ se , about which can be sought . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; k@@ de ; Programs is also &amp; D came ; an open source project . that means , it is dependent on the support of the end users . they should therefore report problems and improvement . &quot;
&quot; the mil@@ king of problems or suggestions are as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the help menu features an entry problem or wishes . this opens a dialog with a under@@ lined link . if you have entered into a dialog with a under@@ lined link . all necessary information Are you registered here . follow the instructions to send your message here . &quot;
&quot; then came a project that is supported by a community . that is , the user and developers came to help each other . if you would like to answer any other users of the user &apos;s mail@@ ing list . in this mail@@ ing list , however , we would like to answer any questions about other users . in this mail@@ ing list , however , you would like to answer any questions about other users . in this mail@@ ing list , however , you should know this language therefore , you should therefore be powerful . &quot;
you can also visit the Management &apos;s website to learn more news about released versions and other information about &amp; Management .
the best start to participate in &amp; D is to take part in the developers mail@@ ing list . guidance to sign up in the developer @-@ mail@@ ing@@ list of &amp; Management came ;
&quot; when you start &amp; D came ; for the first time you are asked , where you can store your pictures and your database . you can simply specify a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the folder button icon to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you must specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data is stored . this path remains the same for all images . &quot;
&quot; later , you can add as many folder as you would like to add . &quot;
&quot; if you have already a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder , the images , as a base folder . if no picture is changed . no picture will be altered . during the run of the folder you will see a progress show like this : &quot;
&quot; &amp; D came ; thir@@ sty the libr@@ arian bu@@ f@@ ad in its entire depth . you can not stop any sub@@ folder , unless it returns in hidden folder . this allows you to insert an item in the hidden folder . this can insert an item in front of the name of the sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you &apos;ll notice that the albums into My Al@@ ben@@ liste no photos as symbols . you can change it by using a popular photo from the album and this will then be used as a Alb@@ um@@ icon . more details can be found in the section albums . &quot;
&quot; once you have configur@@ ed the base folder , you can enter into &amp; D ; and after that you should learn how to manage M@@ one albums and My sample box to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; raw material support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , so it can be used . the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out whether a special camera is supported , so you will find a list of supported Roh@@ k@@ amer@@ as in the menu Help . &quot;
&quot; as you set up this and work with raw files , is described in the sections of Ro@@ h De@@ co@@ der@@ Settings and Ro@@ h work@@ flow . &quot;
&quot; a simple and user @-@ contact camera is made available to you , so that you can download with your digital camera and support your photos directly in &amp; D . naturally , every medium and every card reader will be supported by your operating system , which will be supported by your operating system . &quot;
modern Dig@@ ital@@ cameras are signed by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wir@@ e ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) to data transfer . the camera can also be implemented as USB @-@ mass storage device . the camera can also be implemented via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its der@@ iv@@ atives . older cameras may also be used for connecting the seri@@ al port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; Management came ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 to communicate with digital cameras , which was a constantly increasing number of over 800 cameras support . download the Picture Transfer Protocol , a wide common protocol , which was developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it permits the transfer of pictures of digital cameras to machines and other peri@@ ph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
many old digital cameras use the seri@@ al interface for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and transmission via the seri@@ al port will be obsolete . it is now supported by the transmission of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 through . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has been designed with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support , so that the Exif support is needed by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera drivers . if the Exif support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may see the Thumb@@ nails , or the creation could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things to us &amp; D is how simple its functionality can be expanded through modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is a approach to develop a joint Modul@@ structure for &amp; D ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . aim is to provide the modules to all the graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manip@@ ulate pictures in virtually any way . their advantage is that it is much easier , &amp; D came ; by writing a small module to complement one function as the changes in &amp; Management came ; even perform . &quot;
&quot; to simpli@@ fy the window , you can either remove the page with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch in full @-@ mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Um@@ sch@@ old + F . &quot;
&quot; you can draw and take pictures anywhere : you can put an image in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ tree , over the horizontal divi@@ ding line or into another application window . the only limitation is that one picture is not in terms of pass@@ words , data list or ad@@ dic@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; - a file selection allows you to stand the most common : JPEG , PN@@ G , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , films and audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the tool@@ view . thus , the filter appears on the filename only if this ind will display the tool@@ bar displayed . whatever fields will be displayed in the dialog of the configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; represents an organized view on your photo@@ cop@@ es . these albums can be stored in a single night@@ club . these albums can be stored in a single night@@ club , after the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ ds or after the date that the album can be created first , the date can be changed in the properties of the album . &quot;

&quot; Management came ; character@@ izes every picture by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorith@@ m . this allows for images to compare these sig@@ natur@@ es . the lower the difference between two levels of image , the more comply with them . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar comments : this is an area in which you can drop any picture . by means of a spon@@ ge , the result can be enlarged or decreased . if you slide a picture of somewhere over the symbol of the in@@ ew@@ ing search in the left page row , then this will open up and you can drop it there . &quot;
sk@@ etch : open @-@ color sk@@ etch : draw a fast sk@@ etch and &amp; D copy ; finds the matching pictures . also here a sw@@ elling can be set .
this rider provides an intuitive card tool based on the Mar@@ ble @-@ mini program . you can press C@@ tr@@ l ; lin@@ ker clicks and move it with the left mouse button . all pictures within these coordinates are filter@@ ed and shown . this is of course ahead of your pictures Ge@@ o data .
in the box below you can indicate a name for your Ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . he works like a live Geo@@ folder .
&quot; then came a blan@@ k in a separate window available with which you can easily compare pictures . he works with all the supported image formats , also raw files . &quot;
select one or more pictures from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L D@@ em illumin@@ ated from the context menu . the selection will be added to the lumin@@ aire and its windows open . if you are back in the &amp; D format you can open the lumin@@ aire fast with L extras .
&quot; out of the pres@@ eas@@ bar , you can drag the pictures that you want to compare yourself in the left or right area of the window . if you can preview what copy in which window will be left and Zoo and shi@@ fts on one of the images , then these are also carried out in the other picture . you can also compare the same area of the two images . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to load fast from a picture series , then the two first pictures will automatically navig@@ ate into the areas of the same . the right noti@@ fied image will be displayed in the upper section . this is simpli@@ fied by a number of similar images . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal holes are also working directly from the lumin@@ aire such as F@@ 4 File Edit ... &quot;
&quot; all frames information from the right page row of the main window are available for both pre@@ ten@@ ing pictures in the lumin@@ aire , this makes it easy to link visual differences with regard to the back@@ side effects . &quot;
&quot; in the lower end of each section you will find a built @-@ in Til@@ table function , which you can see to the crossed paths . to keep the visible section of the picture , you must hold these ank@@ ed and the &amp; L@@ MB ; pressed in the mode Pre@@ mature ones will then show both pictures of the same image area . &quot;
the zo@@ oming is working as well as in other views . simply use the z@@ oom Reg@@ ler among the pictures or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel around into the picture and out in addition to zo@@ oming . this happens in both pictures if you &apos;re in the mode preview .
what is a digital survey - apart from the mo@@ de@@ code ? digital invent@@ ory considers every part of the process of the following after the image has been made up to the final issue and the permanent storage . each of the pictures takes a form of digital input @-@ management through . most of us do this but not in a systematic and efficient way .
&quot; we will give you a tool to secure a plan and practical tips on how to secure your pictures . we consider downloading , ren@@ ame , protect , evaluate , maintain , wait , wait , wait and export of images files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; digit@@ ally invent@@ ories takes on , index@@ ed , categorized , categorized , transform@@ ised , consistent , con@@ cis@@ ed and ex@@ ported content that are mon@@ eti@@ zed or cultural value . &quot;
met@@ ad@@ ata are defined as data about data . met@@ ad@@ ata are in accordance with your definition data that will provide information about or a documentation of other data that will be managed by an application or environment .
&quot; I d@@ are to claim if you want to find out more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you do not even know how many photos you have , then do not use how many photos you have , then do not use it for fast sear@@ ches and a secure archi@@ ving to you with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you need to do and know before you maintain something into your system , the structure of information structure is to be organized in contrast to the data structure . you have to decide whether other access to your photos do need to save whether you want to save them to a reserve network &amp; etc . note that you will eventually change to a larger drive . &quot;
maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly over your memory location . if you were able to make enough pictures in a year . if you have enough photos then you will use sub@@ folder as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . then export a folder for images that you print or published on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing of photos , archi@@ ving , working procedures , constant refu@@ ge of images to different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % Archive and 5 % work files will not want to organize your structure for this content . &quot;
which types of files are fit together ? the separation of data types makes the st@@ ap@@ el@@ processing sim@@ pler . separate the new of old files .
the separation of original and work@@ files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for a original or a derived picture .
&quot; we also recommend the met@@ ad@@ ata option to store met@@ ad@@ ata in the setup side of the met@@ ad@@ ata in &amp; D . this ensures that Ex@@ if@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be stored in the file , then you can easily select the met@@ ad@@ ata from the database by selecting the appropriate point in the menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change ? this represents a met@@ ad@@ ata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones . &quot;
&quot; now the real work begins , as you have now to choose any photo . of course , you can select all the pictures that need the same attri@@ bute and set the value then . they start best with the rating or ranking . this makes sense , as you can focus on the best photos . &quot;
&quot; now let &apos;s take us now with keywords , keywords as you are frequently in other programs frequently , or categories . all three are syn@@ onymous for the same thing . &quot;
if you first import@@ ed pictures from a different source with built @-@ in keywords then &amp; D came ; automatically insert the tree for you to build the images in the proper place . the reverse of Hier@@ archy within the building is not a problem and can simply be done by the pull of a sub@@ tree on another . the changed terms will be done by &amp; D ; updated as it &apos;s the under@@ trees .
&quot; the graph shows how different met@@ ad@@ ata cut itself . this is a very co@@ ar@@ se representation , since each block of met@@ ad@@ ata exists in truth out of many sections . data stream and cal@@ ender dates are characteristics of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords , the next section relates to form@@ ations or comments , the third important tool to cop@@ ate your met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; you want to see most anyone your photos just to see , they want to share it with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . they are sure to be interested in your photos . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then start to see some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I say to you that this the Lan@@ de@@ platz of Al@@ lied &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after the landing is . Wow ! it starts to dream , associations , memories , the historical time period is again present , you may even hear the silence . the lab@@ eling has completely changed your perception of this panoramic position . &quot;
&quot; for other who regard your photos is the title possibly more important than the image itself to create an interest . remember , the key is to transfer the meaning of the viewer to help Him to understand about the m@@ otive you moved to understand what you understand . &quot;
&quot; it is fine when a picture is not perfect , if it is the strength only with a lab@@ eling for itself alone . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; D came ; you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alised alphab@@ et ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , then you can even use it for a selection of pictures at the same time . KDE also provide you with a sp@@ elling check for your wishes into the lab@@ eling and / or the title of the Web @-@ gal@@ eri@@ es@@ ystems . &quot;
&quot; remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find out into another city without navigation system ? it was not a boring planet in front of G@@ oogle@@ Earth ? good , because with pictures the train travels the sp@@ atial presentation now already with light speed . &quot;
&quot; the possibilities that ge@@ ol@@ ocation are already unt@@ et@@ able and will still be deeper into the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can also export your travels through pictures with geographical fields . you can also export the pictures at the venue . you can also export the pictures at G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flick@@ r &amp; etc ; with the G@@ oogle@@ Maps @-@ viewer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Copy@@ left is a Wor@@ t@@ acle with copyright and describes the practice the copy@@ rights to remove limitations on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms are also valid in all changed versions , so also for the works of others . &quot;
the following description tells you what information came in the application page of &amp; D ; as information should be depos@@ ited :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for accompl@@ ishment and author ) : this field should add your name , or the name of the person who created the photo , for example , the name of the photographer can be used , for example , the name of a company or organisation should be used . this field does not support com@@ ma nor Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for amplifier ) : associated with the author . this field contains the working conditions of the photographer . examples may be title , as : Employee photographer or Independent photographer . since this is a note to the author@@ en@@ field , this field has to be filled this as well . &quot;
&quot; editor ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the An@@ biet@@ er@@ field to identify those who are the photo . if the photographer is listed here . if the photographer is listed here . if the photographer is listed here . if the image is a bearing photo , then the group / agency will be shown here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this has no protection against abuse . anyone who has no protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ators . each of which is a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and Hal@@ f professionals , this protection is very important to this . &quot;
&quot; in the near future , the digital water@@ mark is unique . it will be used in the near future , such a module for stress processing . &quot;
&quot; themes : record , turn@@ outs , bal@@ ances , ECC , transmission error , aging , red@@ und@@ ancy , life time , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tions &quot;
&quot; of course , we are not talking about CDs that lost on the road or a brand . these kinds of losses are the same that can also happen to you with traditional paper photos or negative . in this section it is about problems with the so called &quot; &quot; New Media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; cro@@ ll On@@ track , the largest data set @-@ up company in the world , has some interesting statistics which has a data loss . &quot;
&quot; to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs must be treated as much more than a few years . of course , you can also keep CDs and DVDs in archi@@ ved quality . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for themselves . if you believe it is in your mess@@ aging room . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ read@@ able , but you can use this risk in which you use good dis@@ ks and good recording . the best DVD recording are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much reliable . it turns out the right to choose . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to mistakes , even if you are just written . therefore , they use a check@@ sum@@ men@@ mechanism to protect themselves . therefore , they use a check@@ sum@@ ming mechanism . despite this massive protection they need for the form@@ atting and the control environment . despite this massive protection they require to chemical ag@@ eing , Ultra@@ purple light , dust &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs there is a favorable program called I@@ so@@ B@@ uster which appears to do wonder@@ s on CDs and DVDs . it is also not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications the damaged data of damaged dis@@ ks , dis@@ ks , Flash@@ media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
optical Media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to win the For@@ mat@@ war against HD DVD . a dual layer of Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus nearly sixty @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . everything about CDs and DVDs said of course also applies to Blu @-@ ray disc .
&quot; burn slowly with a good balance on high quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ etary format . read the data with a description , date &amp; author patterns , and after@@ ward at a clean , dark dry and off animals protected place . do not forget the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media . &quot;
&quot; discre@@ pan@@ cies retain your statistics for themselves . your manufacturing board includes a new disk , but not the data . Google provides for this subject a big field study about the troub@@ les@@ ticks of hard drives : discre@@ pan@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; shortly : dis@@ ks keep the longest in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . at lower temperatures , the fault @-@ rate increases user . some of SMAR@@ T you may termin@@ ate the immediately forthcoming fail@@ ing . these are especially read@@ ef@@ ters and rel@@ ent@@ ance . the expected time period is between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; this is only about the complete losses due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to an electric power before you have secured the files , but these losses normally allow themselves to recover without big problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electrical devices are not much exploited , that can take serious damage on devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processors , complete data loss , hardware @-@ her@@ boards , destro@@ ying m@@ her@@ boards , and other def@@ ects . therefore , you are taking yourself in front of the in@@ avo@@ idable that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; the most common protection against black@@ heads is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that a part of the energy supply absor@@ bed and rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in . however , you think that not every plug @-@ in includes also an over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should consider the UL 1449 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also be careful about that he protects the protection against the Blitz@@ krieg . &quot;
&quot; as an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should be sure that also all peri@@ ph@@ ery equipment , which can also be connected to your system . some manufacturers can also provide a telephone connection for your mo@@ dem cable . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ ax@@ ial cables of the cable mo@@ de@@ ms and the television card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a viable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks and therefore contain very small and you also contain the protection for the mo@@ dem . thus , you are ideal for travelling . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection , your system will not really protect your system from smaller osc@@ ill@@ ations . even a loss of a few seconds can lead to loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a break @-@ free power supply . &quot;
&quot; besides the protection against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically be cor@@ d@@ less energy available when an electricity exp@@ ires . some models allow them to continue working till the flow proceeds to them . however , you should even continue to work out until the current quality requirements like a over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the life @-@ time of the battery and the underlying software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; raise the potential risk that your invo@@ icing system is exposed to &amp; euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ w US@@ V can get you for less than a euro ; 40 . this is just a small price , if you think it is just a small price . to conclude , you should always remember all cables before you go to the holidays . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web @-@ Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the correct configuration , you can use this as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is a further popular offer with which you can store any amount of data . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to the hard disk drives , however very expensive - 40 GB costs EUR 75 per year and 400 GB cost @-@ dollar ; 500 . in addition , you have to send the data about the compar@@ atively slow Internet . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the solutions are suitable only as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flick@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo @-@ community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com make online memory services that are available on photos . your free memory is available on photos in case of Flick@@ r dramatically . for 25 $ per year you will receive unlimited memory , which should be reviewed yet in reality . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data protection , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatic thanks to the TCP protocol , and the large companies are included in the offer to secure and a shared memory . thus , they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ sure . &quot;
the diagram illustr@@ ates the elements of the transmission chain in calcul@@ ator . all transmission errors are pr@@ one to transmission errors . the file system z@@ fs and b@@ tr@@ fs are at least the data integr@@ ator between operating system and hard drive .
&quot; the worst thing is that you no one says when a transmission error occurred , not when it was happening in your hardware . all these dist@@ urbances remain un@@ discovered until you have no protection in your computer . no one seems to have thought to be in your computer . no one seems to have thought to be done in your computer . no one seems to have thought to it . no one seems to have thought to it . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a significantly more secure way than that in your computer . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable power supply parts are another source of transmission loss , since they generate interference within the data currents . in normal file systems these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are currently not particularly affected by transmission issues , you should look into the future . already 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year . &quot;
Z@@ FS from Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with turn@@ out on lower level and is available under one of the GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is soon available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows . read this article in English .
&quot; oracle has its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ un@@ fs file system . it is still used in alpha status . it uses the same protective mechanisms the z@@ fs and is available for &amp; Linux ; however , it is still not part of the core . &quot;
&quot; do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in not@@ ebook and 46 % in the work@@ top systems . in Not@@ ebooks , the proportion of the theft is 50 % . &quot;
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than the most master@@ ing . it leads to a lower damage , as example th@@ eb@@ row or re@@ install@@ ments . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple &apos;s users know only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; has been no more sight@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less pr@@ one to data loss as propri@@ etary systems : wrong , N@@ TF@@ S is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , travel F@@ s , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems . you can find a very good English article here . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent cor@@ rupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investig@@ ating process during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status will be avoided before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
viruses are the greatest threat to digital information : wrong , theft and human mistakes are the main themes for data loss . &quot;
&quot; sensors and digital cameras are removed from fundamental physical limits . it is that technology further developed , there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and rob@@ ber characteristic of all kinds of light sensors are not far away from this border . &quot;
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 Meg@@ api@@ x@@ el@@ sensors . even though this dis@@ solution is rather deteri@@ or@@ ating for comp@@ act@@ cameras . even DSLR cameras have your limit on 10 @-@ 12 Meg@@ api@@ xel . for higher resolution you need a full @-@ format Sens@@ ors ( 24x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
&quot; a 750@@ GB hard drive is available today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make any other responsible for data loss . so do not secure your data according to a plan and test this backup before you make something dangerous as the re@@ install of your operating system , the exchange of plates or the size of hard disk . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your backup on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a Bl@@ itz check , you are lucky when the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster propos@@ es locally and destroyed a lot . forget air@@ planes : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous for your data dangerous enough . they usually affect a whole room or the complete house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Des@@ ast@@ er@@ prevention means always a local storage . bring your back up the stairs into the neighboring house , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of the physical separation , as stated above is a common reason for a data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup , which is not immediately available , then you can save the one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files will be secured . it is a snap@@ shot with no history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differenti@@ ation : a backup of the files have been changed since the last end @-@ line . creates a complete snap@@ shot to two times : the complete assurance and the last difference assurance .
incre@@ mental Fuse : a backup of the files have been changed since the last backup . you can restore the original status at any time in which such a backup has been made . this backup comes to a backup system next to the exception that is available only .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up your machines . unlike the script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer @-@ tran@@ sc@@ r@@ sync only the difference of files that really changed . this is un@@ com@@ pressed and if you want to increase security about ss@@ h .
secure important pictures directly after you have stored on your computer to a DVD or another op@@ tic medium .
&quot; this approach allows you enough time to discover losses and restore . at the same time you will come to secure a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for each month . every additional output should be done manually , after which you have made a complete review . &quot;
&quot; topics : met@@ ad@@ ata , in the image file stored IP@@ TC files , original reserve , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re @-@ locate images and met@@ ad@@ ata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , refl@@ ections , ... , use of the internet . &quot;
&quot; that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years that is about the time period in which you really are interested in yours , because they remember your childhood and youth , there are two strategies that should be respected : &quot;
&quot; because the future is un@@ predic@@ table because of your nature is un@@ predic@@ table , you must look at all the time today . unfortunately , there are no other option than a certain vig@@ il@@ ance . unfortunately , you should have used yourself as the current system back@@ wards . the less variations you have used in the past , the more easier to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered with the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
&quot; virtu@@ alization is now available for everyone . if you have an old system that for reading your images , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for a later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the expert pressure for the possibility to change a system in its mag@@ nit@@ ude . this is actually getting bigger .
let &apos;s go out of that you have planned the scal@@ ability and have placed the area you can enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . with * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and shift it to a new record :
&quot; check with the command d@@ mes@@ g , whether your new record was detected by the system , but hang it not one . &quot;
&amp; bar ; d@@ d if = / dev / sd@@ b &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / sd@@ c # source ; part@@ ed res@@ ize / dev / sd@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the record in MB@@ s ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , fat@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollars ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of rei@@ ser@@ fs if necessary &quot;
&quot; open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software can read more , then you can create these yourself . this task is easier for year to be easier . &quot;
GI@@ F is a propri@@ etary , pat@@ ented format that dis@@ appears slowly from the market . you should therefore no longer use it . &quot;
&quot; PN@@ G has been designed as an open source standard developed by GI@@ F . it is a lot more . it is lost , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ ad@@ ata , 16 @-@ bit per colour information , but not as many as TI@@ FF needs and a slow com@@ pression . this format we want to help you save your pictures . &quot;
&quot; TI@@ FF was widely used as a image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ com@@ pressed form or in a container with a loss of com@@ pres@@ sion@@ sal@@ ary algorith@@ m ( DE@@ FL@@ ATE ) . a problem is , however , that this format is adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types . &quot;
DN@@ G The Digital Neg@@ ative File format is a licensed and open raw material that was developed by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G has been developed by the need of the camera format . DN@@ G is already available on the need for the need of met@@ ad@@ oh@@ ydr@@ ates . DN@@ G is now available and we hope that the competi@@ tor Canon and Nikon it to be used sometimes some@@ time .
&quot; this is possibly one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a characteristic of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is permitted with enlargement &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer to archi@@ ved a original of your recording , mostly in the pipe file , as it saves the met@@ ad@@ ata separately from the image file . therefore , you can think about the connection between the met@@ ad@@ end@@ at@@ ei and the image file and as mentioned above , you should consider whether you use DN@@ G as containers and place everything there . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization that supports a large area of use and business models . among the activities of D@@ CM@@ I , discussions and collabor@@ ative work in the D@@ CM@@ I working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and elabor@@ ate efforts to achieve a far @-@ reaching acceptance of met@@ ad@@ ata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images on the camera web page , you can use this as temporary backup . &quot;
convert Roh@@ files to DN@@ G and save it in your cart . this function is not yet implemented .
&quot; for a subtle process , you can use external programs . if you edit the images again with &amp; D ; then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata again . these were cut under certain circumstances by other programs . &quot;
&quot; you can only export the pictures for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . then export them to MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to add your photos in &amp; D . in the section adding a photo to an album , you can add a description . the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for the imports of images to your Alb@@ end@@ at@@ enb@@ ank . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; D ; to use this using the machine , turn the camera to the Display@@ gem@@ o@@ dus to and turn it . a further description can be found in the hand@@ book of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when you start the camera interface , you try to connect with your camera . if this is the connection , a fer@@ ous -@@ indic@@ ator will be displayed at the bottom . some cameras do not appear on the bottom , the filename and a symbol for file order for each file , photos , movies , music etc . on the camera displayed . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information on each entry . with the page features and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera interface you can see the properties of a item or its met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; this dialog shows file properties and the photo@@ information that are stored internally from the camera . a symbol indicates that the picture has not been downloaded to your computer . note that in some digital cameras do not have any information available . &quot;
&quot; the rider Metad@@ ata presents the internal met@@ ad@@ ata as Exif , producer , GPS etc. from the image . this information is the same as at the met@@ ad@@ ata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; D ; or the image processing . note that these met@@ ad@@ ata are not available for some digital cameras . &quot;
the easi@@ est way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button download and then download the photos from your camera to a single album in &amp; D . when downloading the photos were not deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures will be downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
&quot; if you do not want to download all photos , you can only select the desired effect with the standard methods of &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the button download and then download the selected option . the button to download you will be selected as long as you have selected some photos . &quot;
if your camera supports this is an option to download new . these pictures have been downloaded now . in this case the new pictures are downloaded with a star in the pre @-@ show@@ case . if you choose this option , of course only the new images will be downloaded . &quot;
&quot; if you use the buttons All the buttons are downloaded or downloaded , a dialog with which you can select the target album , the list of existing albums will be displayed in which the photos can read in paragraph M@@ one albums . select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after which you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; D came ; invites the photos of the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the requested photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can clear all to delete the button Clear All . if you just want to delete some delete , so you must choose them first and delete delete delete . &quot;
&quot; note that there is no possibility of photos that you have deleted from the camera , re@@ placing them completely deleted . if you want to delete them from the camera . if you want to delete them from the camera . if you want to delete them from the camera . if you want to delete them from the camera , as this is much faster now . &quot;
&quot; cameras are used as a filename for the photos often not particularly meaningful names . this data might be deleted once again , in case you can download photos from different references into the same album . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time in which the picture was taken into the filename . &quot;
&quot; in the next section you will find options to the Dre@@ ams and mir@@ rors of the picture and for dat@@ ors @-@ based under@@ lines . if you use this last option , will automatically create a folder per day . &quot;
the options Dur@@ ing the transmission opens three other options that will be performed before the photos on the plate will be saved . the first two concern the data about the author in section Standard Aut@@ ori@@ denti@@ ty . if you choose this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the Exif information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct the date &amp; time for all download images . &quot;
if you want a different date format than the default format you can use e.g. in the editing field the pre@@ fix photo@@ - % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . place the option to read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time .
&quot; if you use the option camera filename , you have the possibility to modify the filename in case of case or in a large letter , if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new filename , the &amp; D came ; for a photo , is displayed below the name that displays the camera in the preview . your settings to ren@@ ame are stored and automatically used when you open the next time the camera window . &quot;
&quot; if requested , all information about the orientation of the camera to perform at the time of recording . not all cameras do this information . in section page row met@@ ad@@ ata you can read more details about the information that your camera has been embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; the automatic rotation is usually swit@@ ched , and if your camera does not provide this information , lets you put the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the button Extension and select the automatic rotation in the lower section of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera was posted on the date when the photo was made , can be made available to download it . all pictures with the same date will be displayed in the same album . all pictures with the same date are loaded into the same sub @-@ album . not all cameras will be available in the same sub @-@ album . not all cameras will be available in the same sub @-@ album . in section page row Meta @-@ data you can read what information your camera could be embedded in the photos . &quot;
this option is usually swit@@ ched off and in this case &amp; D came ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this option . use the button Extension and select the option dates at the bottom of the window .
&quot; the easi@@ est way photos from their computer to load your camera is the button download . then select the file select dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears , in which you can select the files you are to be uploaded . you can also select more than a file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods . &quot;
&quot; after the photo selection is done , asks &amp; D came ; you where the images will be loaded up . a folder @-@ selection dialog for the camera appears . select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the images are not deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this is a position meant that can be specified in long@@ itude and lati@@ tu@@ des , which can be displayed on a map . the identification of the data may be performed by the American GPS , the Russian GL@@ ON@@ AS , the European Galil@@ eo or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers , it may also be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to use an area by automatic inclusion of GPS data . environmental plann@@ ers , military , police , architec@@ tur@@ e@@ ros and real estate mak@@ ler can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten your photo , where exactly the photo was done , you can send a postcard to another &amp; D ; users want to send a postcard to another &amp; D user , who want to loc@@ alize the location of the photos , it &apos;s good the position data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is how do the GPS data get in the image ? first , you should know that exi@@ v@@ 2 many GPS data fields , such as direction , Se@@ als and map references . the question is actually more , how the data can come in these fields ? there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , about a post@@ processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for the geographical assignment ( manual ) and last via the manual input from known places . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there are currently no camera which has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few that working with GPS recipi@@ ents to work together . either as audio module , or by sending the data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS @-@ Interface : Co@@ y@@ ote@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q i@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with gp@@ sman or g@@ ps@@ bab@@ el . you will need to save these data in gp@@ x format as this is the only format is supported by module to geographical assignment .
there are several programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS which can extract data from images and by GPS . on the following page you can make the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you use the long@@ itude and lati@@ tu@@ des or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ if@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the sign of characters , e.g. by map@@ s.@@ g@@ oogle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ g@@ oogle.com shows no European tr@@ ams . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which will show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; then came to give you so much control over its operations , as possible . there are many settings to set up the behavior of &amp; D . to set up on these settings , you must change in the menu settings . you can change between these settings , by clicking on the symbols of the left . &quot;
&quot; select action can be set on built @-@ in preview or re@@ processing it . you set the default behavior of &amp; D , if you click on an entry in the main view . &quot;
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copy@@ right@@ ed data . these data are selected automatically in the appropriate IP@@ TC data . even in a database synchroni@@ zation , these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; author@@ ship is a syn@@ onym of fibre line : this field should be the profession &apos;s profession : this field should be the profession of the photographer , as a professional photographer , or independent , commercial photographer , as this is a detailed description of the author , it must also be filled . &quot;
&quot; editor is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the photo , such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be listed here since that the image or agency should be listed here , then the group or agency should be available here . &quot;
the IP@@ TC actions will save the data in the appropriate IP@@ TC field . this met@@ ad@@ ata are permanently stored in the image and not only came in the database of &amp; D . these met@@ ad@@ ata are also available to other programs and can be import@@ ed without lost .
&quot; images described as a built @-@ in lab@@ eling ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG pictures : this synchroni@@ zes the comments that you can also add to your photos , with the images appears in the pictures . therefore , you can already be recorded by other picture ; they will be over@@ written by the by &amp; D . &quot;
&quot; the page settings contains all the options for the information that appear , if the mouse cur@@ sor in the main window via a file is res@@ ting . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # 160 ; Management came ; supports a number of different imaging formats and some video formats ; to determine which file types of files came ; add , you can add the file exten@@ ders to this list and remove . each file in a &amp; D @-@ file ; Alb@@ um@@ ord@@ ner , who has no one of these extensions ; ignored . &quot;
&quot; the default settings can be back again , by pressing the button Ref@@ res@@ h right from each category . &quot;
&quot; however , the settings of the lighthouse was set on this page . every time you can then open the lumin@@ aire . however , some images do not use different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode . however , you only have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode . if you have one , then you can get a better results . &quot;
&quot; by default the image editing a black background behind the shown photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select this here . you can use the work@@ load in full @-@ setting mode . &quot;
Over@@ - and subj@@ ected areas of an image can be marked with dar@@ ker or bright@@ er color in the picture . these colors will be specified here . in picture editing this is @-@ visible pi@@ dus with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 can be swit@@ ched off .
with Chro@@ ma @-@ sub@@ samp@@ ling is meant that the pictures are coded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in color information . please read this article in Wikipedia about the Higher Declaration .
&quot; with the setting PN@@ G files , you can reduce the size of PN@@ G files . this surgery is not reducing the image quality since PN@@ G has a lost free algorith@@ m . if you have a quick machine , you can use this value to a high com@@ pression . it means 1 : a low and 9 a high com@@ pression . &quot;
&quot; with the option TI@@ FF files , you can configure the DE@@ FL@@ ATE -@@ com@@ presses for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . it has no influence on image quality , as the DE@@ FL@@ ATE -@@ algorith@@ m does not work freely . &quot;
&quot; with the setting loss @-@ free JPEG @-@ 2000 files , you can save yourself . even if you have lost the lost setting , the relationship between quality loss and stor@@ lek far better than in the normal JPEG . when this paragraph was not yet supported , however , was not found in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in previous versions of &amp; D , the image processing was only a picture instrument for photos . currently , it is very fast becoming a tool for manip@@ ulation of your photos . with this dialog , you can change the settings of the picture editing . &quot;
&quot; the standard is that all green pixels are equal . if you use this option with a minimum loss of details . this option is a little soft , elimin@@ ates this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option is characterized by a minimal loss of details . this option is characterized by a minimal loss of details . this option is characterized by a minimal loss of details . this option is characterized by a minimal loss of details . this option is characterized by a minimal loss of details . this option is characterized by a minimal loss of details . this option is characterized by a minimal loss of details . this option is characterized by a minimal loss of details . this option is characterized by a minimal loss of details . this option is characterized by a minimal loss of details . this option is characterized by a minimal loss of details . this option is characterized by a minimal loss of details . this option is characterized by a minimal loss of details . this option is characterized by a minimal loss of details . this option is characterized by a minimal loss of details . this option is characterized by a minimal loss of details . this option is characterized by a minimal loss of details . this option is characterized by a minimal loss of details . this option is characterized by a minimal loss of details . this option is characterized by a minimal loss of details . this option is characterized by a minimal loss of details . this option is characterized by a minimal loss of details . this option is characterized by a minimal loss of details . this option is characterized by a minimal loss of details . this option is characterized by a minimal loss of details . this option is characterized by a minimal loss of details .
&quot; if this option is set , the whit@@ eboard is used in the camera . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is used only when the whit@@ eboard is not set . Standard is it a fixed colour balance , which was photograph@@ ed on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in sun@@ light . &quot;
this setting will be supported only for Fu@@ ji Super C@@ CD SLR cameras . the use of the second sensors have the effect that under@@ ing pictures in four steps get more detail in the pointed out . for other cameras this option will be ignored .
&quot; the standard is it the pointed , so the parts of your images are burned down , because of the in@@ ability of your camera re@@ viewing the pointed out , as they show the pointed out in various Ros@@ at@@ ö@@ nen . finally , you can try some parts of missing information from the pointed to re@@ constructed . &quot;
&quot; this is possible , because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red . &amp; D came ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try the missing green and red parts from the still not satur@@ ated blue pi@@ xel . of course , this is a question how much colour or white you want . &quot;
&quot; if you select the option , you get the option to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adjusted for each picture individually . &quot;
put the L@@ umin@@ ant according to your taste . you probably have to set him somewhat higher than the standard 1 . this can also be made later in the image options of the &amp; D image . to keep the time for the demo@@ un@@ icing and should you go conservative .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorith@@ m is a digital image process to re@@ count a complete picture of the partic@@ le data that will have many cameras and which is made available for a matrix @-@ coloured pixels . this algorith@@ m is also known as CF@@ A @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation or farms .
&quot; fil@@ ly came to you three alternatives : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ( variable number of gra@@ dient ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorith@@ m of the ed@@ ges . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with a acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the colors of your l@@ enti@@ ls you can get the red and blue @-@ correc@@ tive values here . this is certainly the best method for a color correction , as it is carried out during the pipe @-@ conversion . &quot;
&quot; a profile will be translated by color information , and gives instructions to be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; D ; information such as the color information from a far@@ br@@ aum can be translated into the other so the colors are as accurate as possible . &quot;
behaviour issues when a picture is opened in picture editing / color management module with raw files .
&quot; color profile folder , select the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .co@@ ll@@ ery / ICC , where you can save all your profiles . &quot;
settings of ICC profiles you have the option &amp; quot ; Standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to be depos@@ ited . everything can be changed during the opening of the raw file .
the color management is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or arg@@ y@@ ll . here are just your pictures and managed not of the whole screen .
&quot; the input profile should be available to the compan@@ ah@@ able and model that you use . not all profiles are created on the same type . there are some , such as Canon , which do not have any color @-@ mapping or g@@ amm@@ ak@@ or@@ ical correction . currently , correc@@ ted d@@ cra@@ w gam@@ ma does not mean for con@@ versions at 16 bit depth . this means you have to perform the color @-@ mapping itself . &quot;
&quot; there are other options like the soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile , with which you can em@@ ulate how your printer can be returned from one device . this is very useful before you print image , as your printer can work very satur@@ ated as your camera and some colors can therefore be very satur@@ ated . this could not correct you , instead of rely on the flash@@ es algorith@@ m of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is quite obvious which color profile is provided for them . unfortunately , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is naturally in@@ official : &quot;
&quot; the Canon profile permits the style for the purpose : F for an exact style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; image ; image plugin interface . it is an interface , which is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; educational and educational work is supported . many modules support , which were written to cooperate with each program that the K@@ IP@@ I interface is supported . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . choose which you want to use , and these will then be loaded by &amp; D . these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition , you will find some also in the context menu of the lecture . &quot;
&quot; Short@@ cuts for tasks , which can be performed by modules , can be set in the menu under settings . &quot;
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project at http : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ in@@ s.org or in the manu@@ als of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the settings of the Di@@ asch@@ au should be easy to understand the time between the image , normally , 4 @-@ 5 seconds good . the other propor@@ tions turn off the met@@ ad@@ ata or from which at the bottom of the images are built during the display . &quot;
&quot; the camera properties show on the left side a list of all the time supported cameras . on the right side there is a button Autom@@ atic detection , which is trying to identify with a camera that is connected to the computer . currently , here are the port@@ settings . currently , here are ser@@ iel@@ le , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wir@@ e @-@ mass storage . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the end you can put the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) . this field will only be active if you have a US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wir@@ e mass storage box out of the camera box . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / re@@ viewing , on which you attach your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; D ; to use , you need to connect the camera with your computer to connect them into the display . &quot;
&quot; if you come out if it came out , the camera was automatically recogni@@ zes . if not , you can set the camera dell and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera appears in the menu camera . &quot;
&quot; you can choose any name for your camera . this will be displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert it here . &quot;
&quot; with the option of confirmation dialog for the moving of &gt; pictures in the inv@@ ali@@ mer , you can set the talk of &amp; D . in the delet@@ ing of a photos in an album . in the sections of a photos and delet@@ ing of a album you can find more details . &quot;
&quot; editorial changes through the right page row can be applied , if you use the option changes in the right page row without feedback . otherwise , you need to apply changes to the button changes . &quot;
you can also bind the ad of the welcome @-@ screen by &amp; D ; this will also acceler@@ ated the start @-@ out of &amp; D .

different color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; D ; used to adjust the main window to your tastes . these settings can be selected by settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of designs will be shown below :
&quot; these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; D , please find more information about it in this tutorial . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D came ; includes a fast sculp@@ ting with some basic tools . you can use them to look at your photos and for correction and improvement . the image editing can be started by clicking on the preview of an image , or by the context menu of preview and selecting the item display / editing item . &quot;
&quot; the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are not part of your distribution . therefore , you are not part of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; a status line at the bottom of the window , the filename , current file number , magnific@@ ation factor , and the current giant shows . &quot;
one menu bar at the top of the top and below the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently used functions .
&quot; the editing functions of the image editing change your photos . however , no of the functions will change before you can save the original photo before you save the original photo or the button save as soon as you have saved the original photo . &quot;
so you should be able to make a copy of your image before you change it . this can save you with file ren@@ dering .
&quot; as long as you do not saved the photo , you can restore the original design by using the menu file or use the button ren@@ ame re@@ produce the image editing in the tool@@ bar . you will lose any change you have been performed in the photo since the last store . &quot;
&quot; almost every action of the image processing can be trac@@ ted , or re @-@ established . the last action you can be trac@@ ting , by using &quot; &quot; Edit and recover &quot; &quot; automatically by selecting &quot; &quot; Edit &quot; &quot; menu . &quot;
&quot; if you often use this , you should do the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z to return and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ old @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; if you select the &amp; L@@ MB ; on the back@@ drop , or re @-@ kno@@ b in the tool@@ bar one moment longer press , you will receive a context menu . if you choose one of the menu items , all actions can be restored and restored . &quot;
&quot; once you started the picture editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or at the same point by using the navig@@ ational standards in the tool@@ bar , if you have any changes in the menu file . if you have any changes in the menu file , you will ask if you want to save it . &quot;
you can start in the photo and out zo@@ oming in which you can use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the file menu .
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : Mag@@ nific@@ ation factor automatically choose &quot;
&quot; opinion of full @-@ mode showing the photo in full @-@ mode . you &apos;ll come in the normal view , in which you can &apos;t want to display the Es@@ c button . normally , you can change this in the setup dialog by &amp; D . you can see this section for setting up the image processing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can select the image file image and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; Druck@@ dialog . you can adjust here the settings before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print single pictures or whole pro@@ positions . all images can be printed out of your selection . you only need to select the images with the default methods and select from the menu Album to export assistance systems . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you just need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Management came ; main window has a page row at the right edge , which represents important information and actions for the selected images . the same page row is available , even in image processing . it will be shown when one of the five riders is listed : &quot;
multiple cli@@ ffs on the same rider leaves the side@@ bar or go back to the edge .
&quot; in the lab@@ eling view , you can enter the folder with unlimited size or insert . please note the remark below . the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the lab@@ eling can be copied into the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields , so that you can use other programs . &quot;
&quot; the IP@@ TC data only support ASC@@ II characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut according to 2000 characters and are re@@ formed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC lab@@ eling field in other applications , you should be aware of these restrictions . &quot;
&quot; after you commented it , you can use either the button or simply switch to the next image , the lab@@ eling will then be saved . &quot;
&quot; besides the application button , there is one button more detail . with this you can also read other met@@ ad@@ ata from the selected file or the database . but this will always be done if you have chosen a met@@ ad@@ ata that is always written into the pictures . &quot;
the section rating shows a rating of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in Su@@ chen and Sor@@ ging . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the page row or with the keyboard short@@ cut . to evaluate multiple images at the same time and use the context menu .
the rating is written into the IP@@ TC field . the coding follows the sch@@ ema in the following table :
&quot; the keywords view shows a search box to the filter of the keywords , the keywords tree and a selection box with the previously mentioned in this &amp; D session . &quot;
the keywords Tree is adapted with the given search keyword . you can restri@@ ct the number of possibilities in search of a keyword quickly . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the lower end is another relief in the input of keywords at a picture series . if you have given various keywords , these are stored for quick access . &quot;
terms can also be set by marking the corresponding propor@@ tions of the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field .
&quot; when multiple images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree , this is only applied to the top image and not on the entire selection , if you want to choose a selection with a keyword , please read the keyword filter . &quot;
&quot; the page bar sample filter is used to change the selection of the main window shown to change . normally , the left side@@ bar with their album , - data protection and search views are used . if in addition , one or more of the password will be used , only the intersection of these two are displayed . all provided keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also drag the keywords and drag . suppose you have been selected in the main view . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it out of the right page row and select a dialog that you ask if you want to place the keyword . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example the main window shows the images on a calendar tag . the keywords filter stands on one terms , which covers the amount of three pictures . they were drawn with Str@@ g + a , and after that a keyword has been removed from the right tags . a dialog asks if this keyword shall be set . &quot;
&quot; this search for changes will take place at any start of the program , which can also be swit@@ ched under settings . &quot;
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and find that it would have one or be , you can easily change this with a double @-@ click on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry , after which in the database is sought . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , key word , etc . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string , which is already set in the database . &quot;
you can also specify a expand@@ able search on all elements of the database with the following options :
&quot; if you want to group options , you just need the cross @-@ field at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing group@@ ing . the options then look like follows : &quot;

this article / tutorial was written primarily by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly made it to &amp; D ; s concrete implementation .
&quot; the reason why you set a colorful work@@ flow , the colours will have the colors available from your camera or scanner . with a colour@@ ful work@@ flow , you can reach that the colors available on your screen or scanner and that the colors do you print or in the Web publish your digital dark chamber . &quot;
&quot; if the subject on color administration comes , then everyone wants to express what buttons it must provide for the results that he wants to provide you with adequate background information about color management . in addition , you should provide you with adequate background information about color management . in addition , you should give you links with deeper decisions to make you the desired result . &quot;
&quot; if your photo @-@ work@@ flow meets all six below listed criteria , you do not have to worry about color administration . &quot;
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated at the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum . ( more information can be found below )
your only other picture shows are sent by e @-@ mail or the web where s@@ R@@ GB of de @-@ facto standard is .
&quot; so when s@@ R@@ GB works so well and life for all so easy , why should you use another color room , and so that thoughts have to do with colors ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the limitation of s@@ R@@ GB compared to the colours we can really see is presented below . it features a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colours we can see , the hu@@ gely @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some larger farms and click on information and then to information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to feel my monitor kalli@@ bri@@ eren when I chose to work only in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum ?
&quot; yes ! whether you &apos;re working in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum or not , you need to work in the R@@ GB of s@@ R@@ GB . if you are working as in the Far@@ br@@ aum of s@@ R@@ GB . then you need to use your monitor to the s@@ R@@ GB @-@ standard kalli@@ bri@@ eren , an appropriate monitoring profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions available , which can improve a picture in most cases . use it , before you try a further manual editing . &quot;
&quot; the functions norm@@ alize , compar@@ isons , automatic shut@@ down and contrast extend from the menu cor@@ rigi@@ ble automatic correction , try to make the best out of your colours . you will be experim@@ enting with these effects which works best in your photo . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this method is scal@@ able about the entire picture , so that the dark@@ est point black and the light@@ est point is as bright as possible without its sh@@ ades to change . this function is often a Mag@@ ical correction for images that are dark or balanced . &quot;
&quot; at the same time this method is j@@ us@@ ed the lumin@@ ance of the colors of the chosen image , so that the hist@@ og@@ ram of the Inten@@ sity consists as flat as possible . thus , it &apos;s the same very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it is also just cra@@ p . it is a very powerful surgery , which can either do mir@@ acles with a picture or it destroyed . &quot;
&quot; automatic down@@ right : this method maxim@@ ises the color area in the red , green and blue @-@ channel . you will find the dark and bright border @-@ t@@ ints and j@@ us@@ ed the red , green and blu@@ o channels on the complete hist@@ ograms . &quot;
Con@@ trast increase : this method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the R@@ GB values of an image by moving the lowest possible and highest values in the greatest possible area and a re@@ ji@@ usti@@ bility of all values in between . this is only visible in full pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the whit@@ ening of &amp; D came ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white @-@ balance of a photo .
&quot; the whit@@ eboard is slightly limited to over a far@@ br@@ oth with 8 @-@ bit per colour . in case you can operate far from the original image , which works in the 16 @-@ bit mode , which means your ways to be correc@@ ted better . &quot;
&quot; this tool is based on a white @-@ bib@@ lical bre@@ ach of the copy@@ right@@ ed of P@@ aw@@ el T. Jo@@ ch@@ bal . they start it via the menu @-@ set colours white @-@ off the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the show@@ case can be adjusted in size . on the left side , both the original image and the Pre@@ view of the tool view . the Pre@@ view is adapted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original whi@@ tish window , then it is enough to click the window . &quot;
the preview of the target photos has a red mark@@ er . the L@@ umin@@ ance of the Pix@@ els under this mark@@ er is displayed as vertical line in the hist@@ olog@@ ram .
&quot; to the right above is a hist@@ olog@@ ram indicated that dynam@@ ically changed , once you change a parameter . this hist@@ olog@@ ram is very helpful , even in well illumin@@ ated images , most pi@@ xel very small L@@ umin@@ anz@@ ee values . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is indicated . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and gam@@ ma . the shadow of Alig@@ n@@ ment lets you improve the Sh@@ adow details of your photos or also to dim@@ ples . &quot;
&quot; contact with the above controls around you , you should use the colour temperature @-@ Pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then somewhere to use the color to calculate the color temperature of the white temperature . in this way the temperature and greenery values are automatically set . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the whit@@ eboard with the list of preferences . the following settings are available : &quot;
the super@@ fic@@ tional indic@@ ator increases the colors if more than a colour channel of the Pix@@ els is over@@ exposed .. you will display the combined result in the tin@@ plate . this is displayed as a pure indic@@ ator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons as and shop make exactly this . each setting of the white @-@ like you can set it with a text file and later load back .
&quot; the button scre@@ eds sets all filter values back to their standard values and the associated neutral @-@ neutral pond . note that also , in addition , you can specify a different photo than your original . if you save it , your original image will change . &quot;
&quot; you can adjust here the co@@ fl@@ ages per colour channel of the edited image . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better for high quality images . these coding also requires more disk space , PN@@ M , TI@@ FF , and DN@@ G for the formats PN@@ G , PN@@ M , TI@@ FF , and DN@@ G . &quot;
&quot; this tool opens the same dialogue as to the processing of blan@@ kets . it uses the change and assignment of color boxes . color @-@ mapping can be performed by the sub@@ window for the use of colour@@ ants . a detailed guide for the use of colour@@ ants , you can draw the chapter color administration . &quot;
&quot; another important tool is available in the menu under colors audio correc@@ tive . this tool provides an integrated way to connect several color channels at the same time . this is helpful , if your camera or your scanner always make the same mistake and you can always need the same correction . in the manual for tone correction you will find more information . &quot;
a very powerful way to correct insul@@ ating problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you will find under colors Gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the &amp; Management came ; tool Far@@ be@@ ff@@ ec@@ te provides you four bul@@ locks , a solar @-@ filter , a ne@@ on @-@ filter , a ne@@ on effect and a cant@@ on filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing , solar isation , also Sab@@ ati@@ er , is also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , and afterwards the effect of the picture was completed by the extra light . this result was a di@@ fied neg@@ atively of the image . this tool was a di@@ fied neg@@ atively of the picture . this tool was a part of the picture . this tool permits you to j@@ ose this interesting effect . &quot;
the intensity checks the solar isation . at approx . 50 % intensity shows the image which is chem@@ ically possible . another increase generates a neg@@ ativity that does not create on phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
&quot; this is an example of the solar panels . the original image is the ( 1 ) , and that is dealt with ( 2 ) . the applied intensity lies with 30 % . &quot;
&quot; the Vi@@ vid filters are simul@@ ated the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it is distinguished by a satur@@ ation , that he makes a stronger contradiction in the colours of brilliant and smooth . try it easy , he beauti@@ fy many photos . &quot;
&quot; Vel@@ via is the mark@@ er for one on day@@ light optim@@ ised paint film produced by the Japanese company F@@ UJ@@ IF@@ IL@@ M . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very complex colors with day@@ light and high contra@@ sts . the characteristics make him a film of choice for natural phot@@ ograph@@ ers . Vel@@ via offers a few photo@@ graphic , especially those who barely scrat@@ ched landscapes . &quot;
the ne@@ on@@ filter si@@ mu@@ til@@ ated ne@@ on@@ ous to the contra@@ sts . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on@@ eness . with great pictures the filter is the total CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not un@@ common that you want to correct the color contrast and the lumin@@ osity of your photos . you can experiment with the tools in the menu under colors . you can experiment with the results you are using the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
&quot; if you get a photo with bad light conditions , you can get the reverse problem : one too large satur@@ ation . in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation can reduce it . all changes you can perform in preview . if you can do the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ osity / contrast / Gam@@ ma is the tool sound@@ proof@@ ed to improve exposure . even if dialogue with this tool is very complicated , you need to explain the three sli@@ der below the hist@@ ograms . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph@@ s of intensity values , a hist@@ og@@ ram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph@@ s are three sli@@ der to the inside and can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
the easi@@ est way to learn to learn it is the regul@@ ator to move and watch out how the picture changes .
&quot; on the right hand , the original and the preview of the picture can be considered . the Pre@@ view is dynamic , based on the settings of the image , updated . on the left side are the following options available . &quot;
sc@@ aling : with this drop box can be adjusted if the hist@@ olog@@ ram is represented with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . for pictures of a constant color is commonly described . for pictures of a consistent color is domin@@ ating the linear hist@@ ograms of a single column . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic sub@@ division will be useful .
&quot; three shelves : the top for the dark ones , the middle for the light t@@ ints and the lower for the middle t@@ ints , commonly called Gam@@ ma@@ values . &quot;
&quot; the three colors can be used in the preview of the original plot , in order to detect the input values of the shade , middle and bright notes automatically . in addition , there is one button for fully automatic alignment . &quot;
&quot; output values : the output values permit the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two shelves which can be used to change the output values , e.g. for example , to be used as a background while something else has to be seen in the background . &quot;
&quot; automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity of the image . &quot;
&quot; save as and shop : with these buttons , the values can be saved in the file system and later loaded the Gim@@ p Levels format . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and the three colors will use automatically for all the shade , means , and sun @-@ t@@ ints . activate the color pip@@ ette that you want to use and click on the preview of the original type for Rot@@ - , green@@ - , blue , and the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ channels . &quot;
&quot; the option super@@ structure indic@@ ator controls all color channels to be over@@ loaded pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indic@@ ator , that is , you get the effect only in the preview , and it &apos;s no effect on the final outcome . &quot;
&quot; below you can see an example of the adjustment of the input values to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and Alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original design is unchanged with ( 1 ) and the correc@@ ted picture with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left , half of the original and the target image is displayed . the Pre@@ view is updated dynamic depending on your settings . on the right hand , the following options are available : &quot;
modification : this selection box allows to connect the canal which is modified by the module :
&quot; in addition to this box are two symbols to change between a linear and logical view . for pictures that creates a digital camera , the linear mode creates a wide balconies . in this case , the linear mode creates a wide beams . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to move a cur@@ vent@@ ot to the right , for example the bright notes , then you can see that these bright notes with dar@@ ker pul@@ ling clothes , and that will be dar@@ ker dar@@ ker dar@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original photos , a red mark@@ ings to see . if you want to change this mark@@ ings on the area you want to change the original value . create a item on this line and move it up and down , until the value is j@@ ump@@ ed to your taste . &quot;
&quot; save as and shop : with these buttons , you can accurately render this . each turn you can have created this fil@@ es@@ ystem is saved and later loaded . the file format is the Gim@@ p c@@ ven@@ format . &quot;
&quot; if you use this method and the three Col@@ ony buttons , automatically create the check@@ points of the cur@@ ve to all channels of shadow , middle and sun@@ sh@@ ades . activate the color pip@@ ette that you want to use and click on the origin@@ als to set the check@@ points for the red , green , blue , and L@@ umin@@ ant cur@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; the option super@@ structure indic@@ ator controls all color channels to be over@@ loaded pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ loaded pixels . this is an indic@@ ator , that is , you get the effect only in the preview , and it &apos;s no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a Black @-@ White photo that was correc@@ ted in the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ kan@@ al . Sch@@ atten@@ - and sun@@ sh@@ ades was applied with the color pip@@ ette and applied to the cur@@ ves . the original ild is ( 1 ) and the fixed ( 2 ) .
the channel bl@@ ender of the &amp; D came ; image processing is a tool to improve the colour channels or change the sh@@ ades of the photos .
the channel bl@@ ender is another highly developed tool to mix the sh@@ ades of images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel bl@@ ender of image editing .
&quot; with the channel @-@ optional box , you can choose the color for the hist@@ og@@ ram : this gives you a first note as you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the left section of the window shows you a preview . the original can be seen as compared to the own rider . &quot;
&quot; the Pre@@ view of the target image has a red mark@@ er . if you position this in the picture appears a vertical line in the Hist@@ ram , to show you the appropriate color value . &quot;
&quot; control controls for the module are right down : regul@@ ator for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you can also activate this channels . if you have the appropriate color components . this is particularly convenient , if you have the appropriate color components . this is particularly convenient , if you have the appropriate color components . try to reduce the benchmark tool for the production of great black @-@ white con@@ versions of your photos . try to reduce the Green @-@ White Portra@@ its . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially if you mix up mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a color leads to a visible ro@@ cket that does not occur in the same place in the color kan@@ al , and whose space @-@ patterns exists in every channel . if that is the case you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rome conversion to that you can reduce the Far@@ stri@@ ches first . &quot;
&quot; the stor@@ ing als and loading buttons are exactly used for this purpose . each any mix@@ er attitude can save you for later and then load it . that used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mix format . &quot;
&quot; the option super@@ structure indic@@ ator controls all color channels to be over@@ loaded pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indic@@ ator , that is , you get the effect only in the preview , and it &apos;s no effect on the final outcome . &quot;
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was re@@ activated . the option L@@ umin@@ escence is activated . the original image is under ( 1 ) and that followed picture under ( 2 ) .
black / White @-@ photography was always fascinating because of your ab@@ str@@ action ability . with the development of digital photography is black / white a working step as color pictures can easily be converted to the computer . also with a set of film@@ filter profiles .
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P@@ 2 Super &quot;
green filter : simul@@ ated a black / white fil@@ ing with a green lin@@ al filter . this looks good with all the scen@@ arios and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
Oran@@ ge@@ il@@ ter : simul@@ ated a black / white film@@ ing with a or@@ bit lin@@ ers . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air pictures . so similar to 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Oran@@ ge@@ il@@ ter . &quot;
Rot@@ filter : simul@@ ated a black / white fil@@ ing with a red lin@@ sen@@ ing filter . this created dramatic direction effects and can simul@@ ate lun@@ ches for day@@ time . so similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ filter .
Gel@@ b@@ filter : simul@@ ated a black / white fil@@ ing with a yellow lin@@ t@@ ating filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Yellow .
Sep@@ pic@@ on : creates warm bright and middle t@@ ints while he adds a bit of cold in the sh@@ att@@ achment . this is typical of the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
&quot; with the &amp; D ; tool texture , you can use decorative tex@@ tures on a picture . &quot;
&quot; by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can look it like an oil painting on a screen , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop species of an old master , a pop kind of portraits of enlarged points or like a wall image on a wall . the menu insert image texture practice the image processing can be used for it . &quot;
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the face of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper Tex@@ tur@@ bine is applied to the photo below . the original ild is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) to see . parameters Rel@@ ief is set to 200 .
&quot; with the &amp; D Group , tool frame can add a decorative frame to add a picture . &quot;
&quot; the eye of an ob@@ server in the boundaries of a photo is no easy task . an opportunity to keep its attention , it is a psychological barrier for the stre@@ aming eye . under the frame the module can be started out of picture editing . &quot;
&quot; type : with this parameter place the desired Rah@@ ment@@ yp for your image . elabor@@ ated the picture with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce , it cuts with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame of the ideal for a button @-@ cro@@ pped and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns . &quot;
width : returns the width of the frame in percent . the value range for the width is reduced from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; this is larger than the original , but the original aspect ratio is greater than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important to print the images , especially if you have used the tool for the ratio . &quot;
&quot; with this practical tool , you can easily insert a form@@ att@@ ed text into a picture of any place . this also goes to several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to users . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text box , orientation , colour from the color room and the character set with its characteristics , the bigger must be the character set . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background . &quot;
&quot; each setting that you have chosen for your text , may change until you press &quot; &quot; OK &quot; . after the picture was saved , the text is part of the picture . he cannot be changed any more . &quot;
you can use a template using a template using a template using a template .
the menu &apos;s picture St@@ en@@ cil uses in the picture processing can be used to put it over a picture .
&quot; for St@@ en@@ cil there are no restrictions on the size and orientation . however , you need to add the PN@@ G file format , and should you just add an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; D @-@ mail ; mail@@ ing@@ list came @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .. &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for first time , you must set up your template with the button basis folder in dialogue . select the folder in which you copied the template . these settings will be reported for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder was set for the in@@ ception , a construction view that reflects the folder structure of the sch@@ ema @-@ folder . the selection of a folder update is updated automatically . &quot;
under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the Mag@@ nific@@ ation factor and the position of your image .
&quot; enlarge : this button is enlarged , the underlying picture . it is center@@ ed to the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
antioxid@@ ants : this button disc@@ usses the image . it is applied to the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture you need to see the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move this button to move the picture under the sten@@ cil picture . take the picture and place it at the desired location .
use OK if you want to apply the sten@@ cil on your image . the image is then adapted to the automatic size .
&amp; D came ; provides three different tools to sh@@ red@@ ness . each of you has its advantages in other areas .
&quot; shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for har@@ ness . it is very fast and easy , but generates , particularly in dark areas , gr@@ ac@@ eful images . &quot;
&quot; Un@@ shar@@ k m@@ ask works on the contrast of the can@@ e to look like a picture . actually it is not a bit , it works rather psych@@ ical Dun@@ st and it makes it a really good job . the algorith@@ m was taken out of Gim@@ p and he is copyright protected by W@@ inst@@ on Chang . &quot;
&quot; Ref@@ ok@@ us@@ ation is possibly the best of the three , since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation . &quot;
&quot; photos without focus as well as most digi@@ tis@@ ed pictures need a correction of sh@@ red@@ ness . this in turn leads to a common colour together . this in turn leads to a common colour together . this in turn leads to a common color combined . the same phenomenon can be observed if color points are printed on paper . SLR cameras normally need more toler@@ able shar@@ pen@@ ing as normal cameras for the private user . &quot;
&quot; when JPEG images , the camera is often applied to a camera internal cup@@ board . images in the pipe @-@ format is always required to be processed during the processing . &quot;
&quot; some scanner now turn to a cross @-@ window already during the reading of the image . if you dis@@ able this , you will receive control over your image . &quot;
in some situations you can get usable results by using a photo with the cup@@ board value . you can call with the &quot; &quot; menu navigation &quot; .
&quot; but they should be careful with careful , since the results are not very natural : the har@@ ness of the ed@@ ges , but also rein@@ force the lab@@ eling . in general , you will find it over the menus . you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques for scre@@ ening . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is cris@@ p . the solution , the image is a little soft to draw , it is much easier than it can use . use the tool to m@@ oll@@ us@@ ement with the &quot; &quot; menu &quot; menu , and experiment with something with settings . the show@@ case on the right side of the dialog , shows you the effect on your photo . &quot;
the filter bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove vei@@ ls of your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the origin@@ als and the preview help edit the image . the show@@ case displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values are often good results and should first consult the effect . an increase in the radius or the operator rein@@ force the effect . if you create the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing mas@@ ke , they will produce h@@ ubs and the impression of ridge near sharp ed@@ ges . &quot;
the radius presents one like lots of pixels on each side of a channel through the filter . high resolution images allow bigger radi@@ i . you should therefore raise pictures best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the original image that is added to the original . this makes the strength of sharp@@ ness set .
&quot; the sw@@ elling value is a break from the maximum of R@@ GB worth and use any difference level . one can therefore define a minimum difference to the edge of the filter . this way , areas with a soft change between the tones of shar@@ pen@@ ing and therefore beau@@ ties in faces , sk@@ ies and water @-@ surfaces . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the first image ( 2 ) . bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a spon@@ ge = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; Management came ; tool Ref@@ ok@@ us@@ ation re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ed a picture by enhancing the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright of copyright protected @-@ protected filters -@@ algorith@@ m of Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool is trying to make a picture of &amp; quot ; re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ing ; in which it is a better approach than just trying the photo . it is using a technique called F@@ IR Wiener filter@@ ing . the traditional technique for har@@ ness of pictures can usually run better results as bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king . you can start it from the menu by using colors ref@@ ok@@ ing in image editing .
&quot; in practice the circular feature is much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung . the Gau@@ ß has a very long tail , which is causing the mathemati@@ cal result also influenced by the original pi@@ xel size , which is far affected by the original pi@@ xel &quot; &quot; folding &quot; &quot; in most cases even very strongly influenced by the remote pi@@ xel . it causes unwanted results . &quot;
circular scre@@ ening : this is the radius of the circular type . it is the most important parameter for use this module . for most pictures the default value should result in . you can put a higher value when your image is very bl@@ ur@@ red then but if your image is very bl@@ ur@@ red .
cor@@ relation : an increase in cor@@ relation can be beneficial in helping Art@@ ef@@ acts . the cor@@ relation may be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the cor@@ relation reduces the shar@@ pest effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; filter filter : an increase in the space filter can help you reduce the values of 0 @-@ 1 . however , values higher than 0,1 is rarely useful . if the space filter is too low . a high value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value is still more poll@@ uted . &quot;
&quot; Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche har@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ n Sch@@ är@@ vi . use this parameter when your discomfort dimin@@ ish is caused . in most cases , you should use this value to zero to avoid anno@@ ying art@@ ef@@ acts , so you may also have to increase the cor@@ relation and / or the or@@ atory filter . &quot;
&quot; measuring size : this value determines the size of the transform@@ ation@@ sm@@ at@@ rix . an increase in mattress size can create good results , especially if you choose great values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the Gau@@ ß &apos;s leg . in most cases , you should choose great values for these parameters . in most cases , you should choose great values for these parameters . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
the stor@@ ing als and charging buttons are exactly used for this purpose . any ref@@ ok@@ ing parameters you have set it will be saved for later and then can be loaded .
&quot; try all viewers , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the image before you use the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible , but later un@@ pleas@@ ur@@ able arti@@ facts leave . &quot;
&quot; when you read images and com@@ press , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ com@@ pressed image . &quot;
&quot; generally , bl@@ ur@@ red m@@ ask produce better results as har@@ ps . this could be caused by causing the bl@@ ur@@ red Mas@@ c@@ ate a larger neighborhood used as sharp@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; theore@@ tically seen , bl@@ ur@@ red Mas@@ k@@ ieren must produce ever arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can indicate the effect of the infin@@ ity filter . virtually is the result of the F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ ters is always just as good as the Un@@ shar@@ k m@@ ask . the F@@ IR Wiener Filter is often better in the processing of small details . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused picture : &quot;
the original un@@ sharp colour picture has to be correc@@ ted . this picture was taken with an an@@ alo@@ ve camera . the un@@ foc@@ uss@@ ed result is due to in@@ sufficient light for the car @-@ focus lin@@ se .
&quot; for more information on the methods of using files in digi@@ tization , you can read a technical comparison to English at this address . &quot;
the regul@@ ator Gl@@ ail sets the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing of the area which has been insul@@ ated in order to generate a more natural pe@@ ar .
&quot; the color @-@ tin@@ te enables a adapted colour for the P@@ up@@ ille . if you want to blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust this here . &quot;
the tool defic@@ ien@@ cies is one of the test developed tool to do not remove the arti@@ facts with un@@ preced@@ ented speed .
the In@@ ner Algorith@@ ms was developed by IMA@@ GE CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different preferences as a starting points to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the available pre @-@ settings are below :
&quot; in case you want to move the filter settings on a j@@ us@@ ability , you can use the rider smo@@ othing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detail@@ ing p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of details . a small value leads to a moderate Gl@@ ay above the image . W@@ og@@ egen larger values should be used mainly homogen@@ ous regions more homogen@@ ous regions . a value of 0,@@ 9 should be necessary . please note that the detail will always be sub@@ ordin@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; self @-@ dependent alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value gl@@ az@@ ed in all directions , while a value close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film gr@@ itt , or C@@ CD smo@@ kes will produce a high value of a similar pattern . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts will be best with a value near 1 . &quot;
&quot; gl@@ oss &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smo@@ othing factor above all . then put this value suitable for the degree of space in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , because it &apos;s difficult to estimate the geomet@@ ry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; turbul@@ ence effects , it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
repeti@@ tions : returns on how often the algorith@@ m is going through . normally here 1 or 2 .
&quot; Win@@ kel@@ gradu@@ al da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ ot@@ rop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is chosen small , so that small angles should be chosen as a long term . you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs . &quot;
integral gradu@@ al &#91; 0,1 / 10 &#93; : integ@@ ral gradu@@ al in pixels . you should put the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pi@@ xel smo@@ othing and never bigger than 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the More about quality that you receive by the choice of this option is only low . it is doubled but the term . we therefore recommend it to allow him .
the buttons as and shop make exactly this . each setting of image errors can be correct in a text file and will be loaded back later .
&quot; image errors is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still take a very long time and pull a high CPU load after yourself . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button break@@ down . &quot;
below you can see how image errors are correc@@ ted . the module is correc@@ ted on a photo that is being used in Guatemala City with an an@@ alo@@ ve camera . as you see there is a peculi@@ ar black Art@@ ef@@ act in the background that is caused by a bad film storage during the journey ( 1 ) to see and the fixed picture under ( 2 ) .
&quot; the &amp; D came ; Rau@@ sch@@ re@@ duction is a very powerful tool to reduce images , it uses a copyright protected algorith@@ m by Peter Heck@@ ert . &quot;
&quot; this tool displays the select@@ able image filter available to remove Fl@@ utes , and other arti@@ facts that can be removed from dust or hair on the lin@@ se ; it can also be used to remove sensors from the camera or mo@@ i@@ re@@ ac@@ ute ; -@@ effects of ein@@ don@@ ated images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about Sensor@@ s of digital cameras , so you can read this in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen@@ shot up shows a typical scene which was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ularity which can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the advanced settings may remain with the default settings . &quot;
radius controls the window size from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) which will be used for the filter . great values increase the time the filter is required per pixels and the image is moving over the picture and color in it is stock@@ ed and thus smaller mistakes .
sharp@@ ness : controls the Pix@@ el@@ ab@@ at . this value sets the pixel@@ pun@@ ching the filter forward . you may need to change the rab@@ bit filter . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter details can no longer get and smo@@ ked or lubric@@ ate again . &quot;
can@@ ats : controls the ben@@ en@@ accuracy of filter@@ ing . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong can not occur the entire noise or rob@@ ber tips . put it on a value close to the maximum ; if you want to remove a f@@ aint smo@@ kes or JPEG @-@ arti@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ous oler@@ ance of the picture . we recommend you either to change the color or light density to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the gl@@ asting process of the details -@@ settings .
color : controls the colour toler@@ ances of the image . we recommend you either to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the gl@@ asting process of the details -@@ settings .
&quot; Gam@@ ma : controls the gam@@ mat@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dark areas , which typically vary stronger . it is also poll@@ uted the shadow . &quot;
&quot; absor@@ ption : controls the Alig@@ n@@ ment of the ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ unc@@ ture . this value is defined as quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius of variations . if he is lifted up , the rab@@ bit more can occur . if he can arise on his minimum , noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter can arise at the ed@@ ges . he can remove rob@@ bers and is the recommended method for that . &quot;
&quot; save and store : these buttons are used exactly for it . all parameters for space reduction you have set , can be saved into the file system and loaded later . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of how smoking can change your life . the origin@@ als is lab@@ eled with ( 1 ) , and the correc@@ ted with ( 2 ) is marked with the standard settings . &quot;
&quot; sometimes a picture to be cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution , the image is a little soft to draw , is fortunately much easier than a picture . use the tool window on the right side of the dialog , displays the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
the &amp; D came ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo@@ art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted Art@@ ef@@ acts of your images . it is very well adapted to dive Gau@@ ß , composition , composition , composition , com@@ presses , composition , composition , and subsequently digi@@ tis@@ ed in digital , original or night@@ ly digi@@ tis@@ ed pictures to remove the content as it is also the human eye . &quot;
&quot; the same algorith@@ m can be used for color and tex@@ tur@@ er@@ ation . the Tex@@ tur@@ er@@ ation is carried out with a different tool , the fault correction , performed . the algorith@@ m team was developed by the IMA@@ GE CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ rich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
&quot; JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : com@@ pression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a loss of com@@ pres@@ sion@@ ings , he creates some Com@@ pres@@ sions &quot; ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ com@@ pressed image . this option is intended to correct these problems . &quot;
the buttons as and shop make exactly this . each setting of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and will be loaded back later .
&quot; photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still take a very long time and draw a high CPU load after yourself . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button button . &quot;
below you can reduce like a photo with equ@@ ali@@ c smo@@ kers .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that with a min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera is recognized on a Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on the faces . the original ild is under ( 1 ) and the fixed under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures have been reduced to an old color photo that has been viewed with a scanner . you can see the scan display of the sc@@ anning lighting and the phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original image is under ( 1 ) to see and the fixed picture under ( 2 ) .
&quot; the shop came ; tool hot@@ pi@@ xel allows the hot@@ pi@@ xel picture of photos that have been added with a C@@ CD camera , eight have been used to remove them algorith@@ ms out of the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pix@@ i project , which are copy@@ right@@ ed by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p . &quot;
bright , tot@@ e or hot pixels are particularly at high quality raw materials photos a problem as many cameras with JPEG com@@ pression over a built @-@ in oppression for the hot pixels . &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; name Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark@@ screen sub @-@ extrac@@ tive method to remove . there are currently no manual method to select the bad pi@@ xel .
download this file in the assist@@ ants with the button dark@@ screen . the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the picture gallery .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you can record the dark screen directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixels by C@@ CD Def@@ ek@@ te . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should download the right ch@@ ok@@ ing image to the correct image . a automatic processing of the dark @-@ image will find the bad pixels . note that the assistant will end@@ ure the last dark screen , and this automatically loads in the next meeting again . &quot;
&quot; the image area and the preview will help you correct the outcome . the show@@ case displays the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are raised in all aspects of the system . &quot;
select an area to see the def@@ ects pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ es these pi@@ xel blocks . these are the available filters :
thir@@ cut : it will be an average of the neighboring pi@@ xel . the resulting color will be assigned to all faul@@ ty pi@@ xel in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels which have a gap of 1 from the pi@@ xel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ lin@@ ear@@ en surface ( 2 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of linear cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ish pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter@@ ing method . all pixels with a gap of 2 or less to the Pix@@ el@@ block ( 2 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of square cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of square cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) to be used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
Cub@@ an : all pixels with a gap of 3 or less will be with@@ drawn to calculate a bi @-@ k@@ ub@@ lic surface ( 2 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of k@@ ub@@ lic cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of Cub@@ an cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ects pixels in the block .
below you can see the hot@@ pi@@ xel correction on a color photo to see from a def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure to be applied . the original image has been applied to 300 % ( 1 ) and the fixed image is under ( 2 ) .
&quot; the &amp; D came ; Vign@@ et@@ ted correc@@ tions is a tool to correct the Vign@@ et@@ ation , i.e. lower corners , of an image . &quot;
&quot; wet @-@ objective , particularly the middle and large photo@@ format , can frequently operate the entire sensor range . instead , &amp; quot ; v@@ ign@@ et@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they can reduce the corners and trunk of the image by reducing the light the sensor can be achieved there . Tele@@ objective is also shown this behavior . &quot;
&quot; but he also has cons . many centers need a factor 1.5 or 2 at Bl@@ aster filter , which should cut the necessary Sh@@ utter@@ ing time under circumstances so that it is impossible to keep the camera with the hand . W@@ eit@@ win@@ kel@@ objective should also use with Center filter , an opening of f / 16 or less , as otherwise un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed effects arise from movement . &quot;
&quot; with the big belong@@ ings of today , Fil@@ men@@ ades and the dy@@ e and film scanner , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a Center@@ filter by adding a blan@@ ket transformation which is made without these filters . the tool permits the transformation with a Center@@ filter on a picture . the algorith@@ m is copy@@ right@@ ed by John Walker . &quot;
with three shelves you can control the Vign@@ et@@ tier@@ i filters and with three further the exposure of the target image .
&quot; density : these parameters controls the degree of light absor@@ ption at the point of the biggest density of the filter . the standard density is 2,0 , what a optical filter with a bolt of 2 , ent@@ angl@@ ed increases the density to compens@@ ate a greater degree of crafts@@ manship , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ osity , contrast and gam@@ ma settings : the editing of an image with the Vign@@ et@@ tier@@ i correc@@ tions reduces the lumin@@ osity of the screen . you have to re@@ produce the exposure of the target image with these options . the regul@@ ator will only provide positive values , as you have to increase the settings only . &quot;
&quot; if you want a subtle re @-@ adjust@@ ing of the exposure of the target image , so let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / gam@@ ma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; D image ; image processing from the menu color Gra@@ dation . &quot;
this is an example of the Vign@@ et@@ table correction to a picture is applied . the original image ( 1 ) shows the Vign@@ et@@ ching in the corners and ( 2 ) the fixed image . a lumin@@ aires and contr@@ action was also carried out with the image using this tool .
&quot; the &amp; D Group came ; Lin@@ ed dist@@ or@@ tion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses in photos . it uses a copy@@ right@@ ed algorith@@ m of David Hod@@ son . &quot;
this tool works with geomet@@ rical dist@@ or@@ ations . colour@@ ful dist@@ or@@ ations cannot be correc@@ ted with this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second Gra@@ des covers the general geomet@@ rical dist@@ or@@ tion of the l@@ ens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ v@@ exe form of the picture .
&quot; the co@@ efficient of the third Gra@@ des has a similar round@@ about , flat but at the ed@@ ges . this correction is not used in the tool . &quot;
the Ko@@ efficient fourth Gra@@ des correc@@ ted the remote corner of the opposite to the second gra@@ ding . if you combine these two can be virtually eliminated any geomet@@ rical dist@@ or@@ tion .
general : this value controls the strength of the dist@@ or@@ tion second engra@@ ving . with negative values may be correc@@ ted by tonn@@ ages and positive values are kis@@ sed dist@@ or@@ tion .
corner : this value controls the strength of the dist@@ or@@ tion of the engra@@ ving fourth Gra@@ des . this value is more powerful to change than in the middle of the image . for most lenses the &apos; Cor@@ ners parameters has changed the parameter of the parameter .
Zoom : this value escal@@ ates the super@@ new and thus leads to a correction first Gra@@ des through . negative values increase during positive the picture .
&quot; clear : this value j@@ us@@ eth the brightness in the corners of the image . negative value reduce the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values they increase . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filter@@ ing settings , illustr@@ ates the dialog with a preview the dis@@ cord correction . the values that you use for your image are saved and used in the next start as standard values . &quot;
&quot; the tonn@@ age or kis@@ sing correction should be performed prior to all sub@@ missions , or size changes . the best guide you perform as all the first . in case you perform a picture and then perform a tonn@@ ical correction , the effect would be apparent . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best correction to show you this tool a vertical and a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can fix the tonn@@ age / kis@@ sing @-@ shaped dist@@ or@@ tion with the help of the lines . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a kis@@ sing dist@@ or@@ tion , the resulting image black corners . you can transform these with the cutting edge tool in the menu or remove it from image editing or via the Zoom Reg@@ ler of this dialogue . &quot;
&quot; for most pictures , the tonn@@ ical correction is sufficient . the next logical step for some moti@@ ves such as recordings from the front , frames and paintings , it is the perspective so to correct it all angle in the picture 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have an easy dist@@ or@@ tion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the tonn@@ ical correction applied to a church in Norway . the original ild is under ( 1 ) and the fixed picture under ( 2 ) .
the algorith@@ m is based on a method of simul@@ ating infr@@ ared movie website that is available under this URL . the filter re@@ produced the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infr@@ ar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity area of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the picture . &quot;
&quot; below the preview , you can adjust two parameters set film gran@@ ulation and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the option to simul@@ ate texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO @-@ Reg@@ ler changes the amount of film@@ makers and the domin@@ ance of colour green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in the conversion . green meadows will be white like snow ! &quot;
&quot; as the filter colour channels used for re@@ produce infr@@ ared movie , particularly the green @-@ channel does not make sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the colour chart are missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infr@@ ared fil@@ me@@ tes used on a landscape photo of New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and that followed picture under ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of aur@@ a in the pointed .
&quot; the &amp; D came ; filter film gran@@ ulation is a simple to navig@@ ating tool to re@@ produce film compounds on your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed filters such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X , known . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturer big silver bas@@ kets of the photo@@ em@@ ul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the film gri@@ ds gives your photo a certain mood or appears to shift back into the past . if you want to release this specific , gallery @-@ like , street @-@ like that you need to use this filter especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ men photos , so you need to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the regul@@ ator , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ism of the Kör@@ ner . the standard value is , although often higher values need to be set to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you still need more bodies , so you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film gri@@ ds to a black / white image applied . the original image is the ( 1 ) and this worked ( 2 ) . the original film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; Management came ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copy@@ right@@ ed algorith@@ m of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; Management came ; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice appearance as an oil painting . natural pictures and breast@@ feeding are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two regul@@ ators to influence this effect . the upper size cho@@ oses the brush @-@ size between one and five . thick@@ ly brushes are better suited for large pictures . gl@@ oss controlled the gl@@ oss or , from the other side , the hin@@ ts . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original ild is marked with the ( 1 ) and that is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixels wide image is 1 and Gl@@ ail 17 .
&quot; the &amp; D came ; filter coal @-@ drawing is used color and intensity gra@@ dient . the lines that can change the con@@ ris@@ se in the drawing . therefore , images whose engra@@ ving themselves are slow to change what scene you would have chosen to sk@@ et@@ ate you . this would be good pictures to start with it . &quot;
&quot; there are two shelves with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper shelves select the foundation size and the lower j@@ us@@ eth the Con@@ trast ( Gl@@ ail ) . &quot;
this is an example of the coal filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed picture ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved due to adaptation of the intensity .
&quot; the &amp; D came ; filter Gra@@ v@@ ur shapes your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was in wax . it uses a copyright protected algorith@@ m of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; D came ; filter Gra@@ v@@ ur is a fast tool to return your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure , in which color is not the most important in the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the picture into a gray , mon@@ dar@@ ed landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows the contrast to the filter@@ ing . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the gra@@ v@@ ur filter . the original ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . the depth used is 10 % .
&quot; with this filter@@ ing group , you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of dist@@ or@@ r@@ ative effects . it is used by copyright protected algorith@@ ms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
wave @-@ blocks 1 : shares the image into cells and look it look as if it is considered by glass blocks .
wave @-@ blocks 2 : analog to Wav@@ eter@@ set 1 the image is covered here with another version of glass b@@ loc@@ s .
some effects need a long time for calculation and create a high CPU load . you can cancel this effects anytime with the button bur@@ ring .
&quot; with this filter@@ ing group , you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by using un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing effects . it is used by copyright protected algorith@@ ms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
Zoom Un@@ shar@@ fe : caught the picture along sun@@ ba@@ er lines that go out of a centre . this simul@@ ates the im@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of often in sports photography .
Radi@@ ale Un@@ shar@@ fe : caught the image through the pi@@ xel of the pixels a focus . this simul@@ ates the im@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing of a turning camera .
removal : caught the image to create the effect of a not focused camer@@ aman . the object seems to come back into the background .
&quot; working conditions : caught the image through horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the im@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing of a linear , z : B : from a car or train photograph@@ ing , camera . &quot;
sof@@ ter Un@@ shar@@ k : caught the picture soft in the dark and strong in the bright pottery . this creates photos with a dream@@ y and sh@@ iny soft foc@@ uss@@ ed ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portrait , Gl@@ am@@ our photos or to add a warm and subtle bulbs . &quot;
shoot : caught the picture by random shift of pixels and simul@@ ates the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing of an arbit@@ r@@ ary movable camera .
intelligent in@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing : finds the bul@@ lying in the picture and caught them without change the rest .
&quot; mos@@ ai@@ c : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then creates it , through the filling with an average pi@@ xel value , new . &quot;
some effects need a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button bur@@ ring .
the shelves are a cute little tool to make shelves to your image . this gives it natural your pictures a n@@ asses look . it uses a pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n protected by copyright protected algorith@@ m .
tropic@@ s size allows the size of the drop to change . because the tropic@@ s size does not automatically decre@@ asing the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish changes the optical effect of the drop on the image .
&quot; you can keep an area free from rain drops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face , which shall be free to choose . if you will start the filter reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es , the area will remain free of rain @-@ rop@@ es . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the rain @-@ rop@@ es fil@@ ters . the origin@@ als ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the first image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the standard values were used for this example . &quot;
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , so you can bring it through mir@@ rors or turning into the right orientation . the tools can be transformed into the menu and transform spi@@ der . &quot;
photo bub@@ bles is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality .
&quot; a picture to a pet@@ ty is simple . the big question is , how can you locate a picture and keep the details ? how can you find the missing information again ? how can you find the missing information again or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g @-@ algorith@@ m here is used here , making it a good work . try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
&quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can change it to the desired size with the tool size . select it in the menu and enter the target values . &quot;
&quot; the tool to the size use a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method , to enlarge the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to thri@@ ve . &quot;
many imaging programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation for example Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge one image . &amp; D used ; the underlying algorith@@ m photo infl@@ ates was developed by IMA@@ GE CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you must say the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the Reiter New size and are below :
&quot; aspect ratio : when this setting is enabled , the entry of the new size is maintained the aspect ratio of the original format . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , because it &apos;s difficult to estimate the geomet@@ ry of the image . even if you want to generate an &apos; van Gogh &apos; turbul@@ ence effects . &quot;
the buttons as well as shop will be used exactly . each inser@@ tion for photo can be loaded as text file and later be loaded back later .
&quot; photo bub@@ bles is very fast with what it makes , but it can still take a very long time and pull a high CPU load after yourself . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button button . &quot;
&quot; you can see below an example of photo fir@@ es by adding a small color picture on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) , and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the Pre@@ view ( 2 ) is the result of linear things . &quot;
&quot; the audi@@ ting of a photo is not only a common operation , but also a frequent under@@ estimated tool to assem@@ ble a picture . image editing just allows you to create a photo with the mouse , through pressing the mouse button and pull the rect@@ angle . you will then see this rect@@ angle then while you move the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you get the mouse button again , the area of the photos will be cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would change after the audience . you can draw the size of the rect@@ angle . a new rect@@ angle generate by clicking on the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the dis@@ section , use the button @-@ button @-@ kno@@ b of the image editing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is tailored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file to save the file to save the newly built photo . &quot;
&quot; in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by shi@@ fting the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in dialogue , will remain intact . &quot;
&quot; in the instrument of side ratio , you can specify the orientation as a high format or cross @-@ format . in the high format , the larger value of the height and in the cross @-@ format of the width is assigned . &quot;
&quot; the tool to side ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always equal , ir@@ respective of whether you can see inches , in@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see e.g. below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio . &quot;
at the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons for the selection automatically horizontal or vertical .
&quot; below dialogue you can use the Max . conversion of the area to access the greatest possible , depending on the chosen relation and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool to side ratio saves its settings depending on the image @-@ orientation ( horizont@@ ally or dis@@ tik@@ al ) . the modified image measurements are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data are reflected in the EX@@ IF data , so that the EX@@ IF data are reflected in the original image and not the original one . &quot;
the settings of the assem@@ ble help allow help to put on help you get your pictures better . these support are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic pon@@ ents are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . such as the third party rule , harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are a possibility to share a rect@@ angle in similar harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles . &quot;
Golden Middle : the golden middle is an split the different natural growth pattern as for example the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us Mu@@ schel or the Bl@@ üt@@ ten@@ ders of a sun@@ flower . it emerg@@ es in all kinds of things we feel as beautiful .
&quot; the golden section is the ir@@ rational number 1,6@@ 18@@ 03@@ 39@@ 88 ... and it has been used for the old Egyp@@ tians and Greeks used to make your temple and pyram@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden partition in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i episode 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; starting from where any number after 1 equal to the sum of their two pro@@ gresses is 1 : 1.6@@ 18 the golden center . a composition that is generally follows is considered visual harmon@@ ious . &quot;
the golden middle represents liquid aux@@ ili@@ ary lines when you commit a picture . these assistance will be shown below :
&quot; the Golden spiral will bring you to your destination good results for your photos . compared to the third party , the Golden Spir@@ ale creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition carries the view of the beh@@ older along the line of spiral and create a balanced visual river . &quot;
&quot; a further rule is called the rect@@ angle of golden spiral , also golden rect@@ angle . this rect@@ angle will be used to create the golden spiral . it should be a line or different objects . this something can simply be there without the eye , it will fulfil its task . &quot;
&quot; the golden tri@@ angles are also leading from the above @-@ discussed spiral cycles . take note of the middle points of the sides of the golden angles . take note of that unlike harmon@@ ious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equ@@ alled tri@@ angles into these lines can be a static object dynam@@ ical . &quot;
&quot; when you use golden tri@@ angles around your frame , create an effect of the professional photographers dynamic symmet@@ ry . try your image @-@ touch on one of the inter@@ connecting points and other visual information in the triangle . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve different . &quot;
the options Horiz@@ ont@@ al reflect and G@@ tik@@ al can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ious particles .
&quot; with the button color you can put the color of the aux@@ ili@@ ary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the aid lines can be invisible . this way you can adjust the color of the lines of your current image . &quot;
the Free rotation is a tool to rot@@ ate a picture by any angle .
&quot; if you make a photo then it happens easily that you are not exactly ver@@ tically or horizontal . this creates a picture in which things are fil@@ med by a angle ; image processing and tool free rotation . you can transform this with the &amp; D rotation , type rotation and j@@ us@@ ing the target angle . &quot;
&quot; turn your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are specified in degrees . with the button settings , you can set the sli@@ der again to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the right side . &quot;
&quot; for your help , the module will set free rotation a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse button to fix the two lines . move it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now , drag the angle as described in previous section . &quot;
&quot; after you have fil@@ med a picture , you will find unwanted holes in the corners . an option to fix it , it is the function transform@@ able to use it from image processing . &quot;
an elegant way to cut the image is the function Autom@@ atically Zu@@ ing . select one of the following options :
the option anti @-@ ali@@ asing is the picture a bit after the rotation . please note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tiv@@ tic transform@@ ations are performed for a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares to the corner of your image . the preview will then automatically re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right side of the dialog , you will find some information that will help you change the perspective : &quot;
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including empty areas that emerged through the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including empty areas that emerged through the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle left top : displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle on the right above : displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle on the right below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; according to adapting the perspective the image is a little poll@@ uted . for a single adaptation this effect is small , but two adjustments produce twice as strong effect and you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after you cont@@ acted the perspective , you will have unbe@@ ar@@ ably three @-@ related holes in the corners . a possibility to cut this is the image with trans@@ forming refu@@ elling from image processing . &quot;
&quot; the foam @-@ tool is used to move a part of the picture in one direction and move the other part into the opposite . a horizontal load , i.e. the upper part of the picture to the right and lower part to the left . this is no rotation , the image is broken into a parall@@ el@@ og@@ ram . you can boot this module via transform@@ ers . &quot;
make your picture by using the Horiz@@ ont@@ al angle and the vertical angle . you can push horizont@@ ally and ver@@ tically at the same time . a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown on the right of the preview .
&quot; to your help you become a vertical and a horizontal line . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the foam @-@ tool to j@@ ose your image . &quot;
&quot; after which you have carried out the sh@@ ear , the image will be a bit v@@ ase . for a single closure , this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two shots are dou@@ bt@@ ful twice as much ob@@ serving and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after switching , the image has un@@ beautiful three @-@ angular holes in the corners . a possibility to eliminate these , it is the image associated with trans@@ forming refu@@ elling from image processing . &quot;
&quot; then came to write a number of libraries and other packages to read and write . the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries have been comp@@ ili@@ es . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of formats . &quot;
&quot; due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all available file formats . however , you will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF at this point . &quot;
&amp; D came ; shows only files in formats that knows . this happens in the file exten@@ sively and a comparison of this with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension came in the list is used . you can change the file in image editing . you can change this list of file systems . you can change this list of file configuration . in the section configuration you will find more information .
virtually all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras do even allow you to use the format to enter the format . a detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; gt ; supports both formats .
&quot; com@@ pression com@@ pression is the application of data @-@ pres@@ sion@@ ers to digital images . thereby red@@ und@@ ant information is reduced , in order to save the image data on a very efficient way . &quot;
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smooth results as JPEG with the same com@@ pression propor@@ tions . the 2000@@ s version can also save loss when this is specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to find out more about the commodity format , so you can read under Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw materials in JPEG or TI@@ FF , with the pipe converter . in the section configuration you will find further information about the use of modules with &amp; D . &quot;
&amp; D came ; supports the loading of blan@@ kets only with the program d@@ cra@@ w which is supported in &amp; Management ; all support cameras will be shown below on the web @-@ page of Dave coff@@ in . the table below shows a brief list of raw materials supported by &amp; D .
many Dig@@ ital@@ k@@ amer@@ as support the recording of a short films . these clips came out in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG @-@ format . it &apos;s not showing that formats and will have access to the films . it &apos;s not a film @-@ working programme and will therefore be used to start a movie file ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings to play movies to play the program to play .

all configur@@ ed cameras will be downloaded here . you can add the entry camera from the menu to add a new camera to the list . please check the camera section following more information .
K@@ IP@@ I module is ex@@ ported to a series of pictures in a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed with G@@ oogle@@ Earth .
&quot; if you reach the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initi@@ ate contrast was already very good , then you can carry out the first four judicial arrangements with the module . &quot;
many tools you need the photograph editing in &amp; D ; your description follows here .
&quot; all imaging tools such as sharp@@ ness , soft characters , lab@@ eling , bl@@ ur@@ king , bl@@ ur@@ king , bl@@ ur@@ king , bl@@ ur@@ king , the effect in a preview before the filter is applied in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; text application ; in this dialog : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter on the current picture . left by him allow five buttons to change the compar@@ ative area . these modes are :
ver@@ tically share without dup@@ lic@@ ate . the left section shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area right of the selected selection range .
horizontal sharing without dup@@ lic@@ ate . the upper range shows the original and the lower displays the filter applied to the range below the selected selection range .
ver@@ tically share the original and right to comparison the effect of the filter .
horizontal divide . the upper range shows the original and the lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&quot; mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the pre @-@ foam range , and otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that can be able to show over to over@@ - and under@@ exposed . the colors used in the general setup page can be adjusted .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse within the picture and take on the part of the picture you want to preview . preview in the left part of the dialogue is immediately updated .
&quot; ( 5 ) : in the left lower corner , here is a help and the possibility of reset all buttons on your default values . all influences from the last use of the module . &quot;
the page bar features illustr@@ ates the essential information on the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
&quot; photo properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data are provided by the EX@@ IF data , if these are available . &quot;
this rider provides an intuitive card tool based on the Mar@@ ble @-@ mini program . you can press C@@ tr@@ l ; lin@@ ker clicks and move it with the left mouse button . all pictures within these coordinates are filter@@ ed and shown . this is of course ahead of your pictures Ge@@ o data .
&amp; al@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used for editing colour pal@@ ettes and to choose colours and nam@@ ing colors .
&quot; the pall@@ ets files , which are produced by &amp; k@@ de ; can be installed either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ settings and hot user @-@ defined color and finishes used . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog palette , you can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets , or browse the folder according to files . &quot;
the cur@@ sor is displayed in the pall@@ et view as a line . it can be moved by clicking the area next to a color is cli@@ cked .
it shows on the color next . the color is described under the pall@@ et view . here also the color name can be changed .
&quot; it can also be used to be used . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to get there the cur@@ sor . then move the mouse with insul@@ ated lin@@ ker button . &quot;
&quot; if the cru@@ ci@@ z@@ feld Bei@@ m cur@@ sor under the button color is inserted , the color is inserted from the color panel on the cur@@ sor . the color is inserted either inserted or over@@ write a different ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write was selected . this mode may set you by selecting the kreu@@ z over@@ write under Bei@@ m C@@ urs@@ or . &quot;
&quot; a selection that has been created as in the last section , can be used together with the promotions of copying , cut and inser@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; al@@ color@@ edit ; used the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name , followed by a quick@@ end sign , if a further color follows . if a further color can be found in the clip@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit . &quot;
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be drawn using the mouse .
you can choose a color somewhere on the screen and then click on the left side .
&quot; graph@@ ically ; is a KDE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ s . graph@@ s are free layout programs . graph@@ s are available in science , especially in science . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graph@@ s &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; -@@ programs with only a few functions . &quot;
the &amp; col@@ graph@@ ically ; project has set itself the goal to replace these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; cold ; program .
&amp; col@@ graph@@ ically ; is a KDE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ s . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; graphic programs : displays graphics with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; cold ; -@@ program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; k@@ ate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of graph@@ s in &amp; k@@ ates ; the graph@@ s are re@@ calculated and represented in &amp; k@@ graph@@ ically ; )
menu to open the graph@@ s in &amp; k@@ ate ; to open or to open the graph@@ s in &amp; k@@ graph@@ ically ; in a &amp; k@@ ate ; -@@ component to open
&quot; download large graph@@ s ( currently , there are problems starting from around 1000 kn@@ ots and a h@@ ack to present more than these kn@@ ots ) &quot;
further required software : &amp; col@@ graphic ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Program , which sets the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graph@@ s . required in the individual : &quot;
&quot; the main window shows the open graph@@ s , everyone in a separate sub@@ window . at the beginning , when you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ ically ; without an argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screen photo . in this case , the tool@@ bar contains only the symbol file and the ( empty ) list added files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after you have one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like in the lower screen photo : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed when the grap@@ e is bigger than the drawing area . you can select with the context menu a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; the mouse wheel use ( high and r@@ under without special ta@@ sts , left and right at penet@@ rate &amp; Alt ; -@@ button ) ; &quot;
zo@@ oming is restricted in both directions by the factor 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph@@ s .
if the file was changed in &amp; col@@ graphic ; the file was changed by another program the following window will be displayed :
&quot; you can choose whether the grap@@ e should be loaded , or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graphical viewer , your decision will also remember so that later , you can change your decision later , you can use the menu item settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to open a Graph@@ end@@ at@@ ei outside a current &amp; col@@ graphic ; an instance , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or on the command line , you want to open the choice if you want to open a new &amp; cold graph@@ s in a sub@@ window of already ongoing instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option you can store your choice permanently , but also change it with the exclusion . &quot;
&quot; at the start @-@ start you can open all the graphics of your last meeting . again , you can save your choice both as well . &quot;
&quot; you can also specify how the graphics are divided into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be chosen freely . &quot;
&quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph@@ s will be displayed on one side , which will be shown on this page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled from the respective parts of the graph@@ s . &quot;
side@@ board with one on several pages shared graph@@ s without head@@ line and with another fon@@ ts
&quot; the site again gives the possibility to set the behavior when a file has changed on the hard drive , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a standard behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore the changes ) or the program for each time . &quot;
the site opening gives the possibility to set the behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ ically ; if a graph@@ s open out of a running meeting . you can set a standard behavior in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that every time ever was asked .
&quot; the site controls gives the possibility to set the start @-@ behavior of &amp; col@@ graph@@ ically ; you can set a standard behavior ( the files of the last session or not determine , in each start to be asked . &quot;
&quot; the context menu , which usually appears at one click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; it opens up additional possibilities : &quot;
here you can choose among different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Lay@@ out@@ algorith@@ ms choose . the entries they are described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&quot; dot ; -@@ algorith@@ m , the standard for judicial graph@@ s . he produces hier@@ arch@@ ical or historical depic@@ tions of align@@ ed graph@@ s . the algorith@@ m places the ed@@ ges into the same direction ( from top to right ) and then tries to produce as short ed@@ ges as possible and as a few ben@@ ds as possible . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorith@@ m is the standard for ung@@ ed graph@@ s . he produces depic@@ tions according to the spring@@ bank model . thereby , the Kam@@ ada @-@ Kaw@@ ai @-@ algorith@@ m is used , the equivalent is multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorith@@ m produces for ung@@ ed graph@@ s , a jump @-@ model layout . it uses the Fru@@ ity @-@ Rein@@ gold Heur@@ iger , and includes a multi@@ channel S@@ avi@@ our for the treatment of large and g@@ ec@@ l@@ ust@@ ed graph@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; cir@@ co ; algorith@@ m arranged the kn@@ ots of circular in accordance with the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and me@@ adow , 2002 . it is useful for certain diag@@ rams of several cy@@ c@@ lical structures . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog , in which you can specify a lay@@ out@@ f@@ ault@@ l , which should be executed by a shell , and the calculated layout of graph@@ s after st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format is able to change the graph@@ s ; algorith@@ ms specific options , or also change the graph@@ s with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;
determines the type of graph@@ s ( judged or ung@@ ed ) and turns the standard algorith@@ m for each type ( dot ; for targeted , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for ung@@ ed graph@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; this setting is enabled , the overview will be displayed if this is necessary . otherwise it is not displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;
displays what is the -@@ mouse cur@@ sor . click with this mouse cur@@ sor on a &amp; GUI ; -@@ item to get more assistance to this item ( if available ) .

the K@@ IP@@ I module pictures read tools available to send new pictures and send them to them .
&quot; this module can be used to invite new pictures to use external sources , and can be used for two sources : &quot;
images sc@@ ots : used the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images by a scanner which supports the San@@ e project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . so that this works you have to installed K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e .
&quot; if you want to open the menu &apos;s menu , a dialog you can choose between all available sources on your computer . select the source of which you want to pick up the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears that you can replace the pre @-@ given default values to select your image accordingly , before you check with the button sc@@ anning the picture . the estimated file will be displayed in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information . &quot;
&quot; note that the window is completely displayed , as some settings otherwise may not be displayed . &quot;
&quot; after you have signed the button sc@@ anning , you have to wait until the scan complete and the window will specify the options of the image file . here you can select the com@@ pression and type of image file . you can also select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image . &quot;
you can create a screen after you have selected in the menu impor@@ ter - &gt; screen@@ shot . a window appears in which you can set the different scre@@ w@@ om@@ od@@ i :
select The complete working area to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; if all own programming windows are selected , the open program will disappear , so you can read other monitors and windows . otherwise , you will have read the complete working space , only the window will be read under the mouse . &quot;
&quot; the delay determines how long screen@@ shot is waiting before it starts . if you need to switch on other labour surfaces , you should select this delay high enough to navig@@ ate the time to navig@@ ate there . &quot;
&quot; after the screen@@ shot was made , the dialog options of the target image has been introduced with the options described above . &quot;

&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization allows the GPS co @-@ ordin@@ ates in the met@@ ad@@ ata of an image and edit . the geographical data is stored in the EX@@ IF panel , and the loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization provides tools available to loc@@ alize images geograph@@ ically in the spher@@ ical coordinate system , which is used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , long@@ itudinal and lati@@ tu@@ des are used . &quot;
&quot; to get your pictures with geographical data , you need a GPS sp@@ ur as XML @-@ file in gp@@ x @-@ format . g@@ ps@@ bab@@ el and gp@@ sman can download the data for you from your GPS device . &quot;
Bild Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images you want to cor@@ related in the main window and call the menu . to load a possible cor@@ relation over time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a donation file with GP@@ X file . this file also contains data from the same time at the same places as the images of your camera . &quot;
if the file loaded a automatic cor@@ relation to the coordinates in red . GPS Sp@@ ur@@ dates are recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore the camera runs will be done with the GMT @-@ time . this can be done with the time zone . put here your camera zone .
&quot; the adjustment for the maximum time period is an upper vari@@ ance for the GPS time and camer@@ az@@ er . is the vari@@ ance of them , the data will be mer@@ ged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
if you don &apos;t have a spy data from one place for images you can edit the gp@@ x file manually and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds then will be cor@@ related all images in this area .
&quot; the options of Inter@@ pol@@ ishing and differ@@ ency in Min. can be used if you do not have appropriate data . if you know that in reality , you can put it in a big time difference between camera and GPS , you can put these borders here and then push the button cor@@ relation to the inter@@ pol@@ er . &quot;
the coordinates can be manually set with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos at the same place . as dialogue could use the coordinates of a call to the next one you only need to use the button OK to put the data in the current photo .
&quot; Lok@@ ation can also be found with the shown card , and enlarge . select the relevant region and enlarge you can easily be selected . the height must always be selected manually . the card can be fitted between card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to hang out the GPS data to the pictures . here &apos;s a small script used to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a picture gallery of HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums as HTML pages and provide the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is U@@ TF @-@ 8 coded to make a best possible internation@@ alisation .
the module has four tab@@ s can be adapted in which the settings can be ex@@ ported . you can select these albums only . you will need to select these albums on the right hand . you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below the Al@@ ben@@ vor@@ schau and the text that will appear in the head of the HTML page .
&quot; the rider appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this rider is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . the option is displayed in each image . otherwise , the image is displayed directly with your default viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , displayed . &quot;
&quot; the rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your related images . select a folder containing the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything will be created there . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the JPEG format format , the EX@@ IF information is also stored in the new pictures . &quot;
&quot; with other color @-@ depth , you can change the default color . the influence of course also affects the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; the rider &apos;s Thumb@@ nails , allows you to find some of the settings from the album Rider for the Thumb@@ nails , which are small images that are displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window shows the user as far the action is . press Canc@@ el to break the process .
&quot; when the module has created the sides , the window will not be automatically closed . you can therefore start viewing whether errors are started during the generation to preview the preview of the gallery . press Cl@@ ose to close the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I imaging is a very fast and flexible OpenGL @-@ based tool to look at pictures .

after the start a picture is displayed by default in the full @-@ mode mode . this can be changed in a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG loss @-@ free module is a tool to change pictures without any of your quality .
&quot; this module allows for the actions listed below , pictures in JPEG format without the usual losses of quality or met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of the loss @-@ free storage is the file size rises , since no com@@ pression of the color information takes place . this is also reflected in the PN@@ G format . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is an instrument that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client does not currently have any documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ org@@ . attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module Metad@@ ata @-@ Editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I teams . &quot;
&quot; using the import -@@ function of the met@@ ad@@ ata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the import function . this will then copy the file . you will then copy the file to which you can copy the met@@ ad@@ ata . the data will be copied after you on the button OK . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all formats . you can write from anywhere , but not in any target format . JPEG is supported by writing . please check back exi@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a number of pictures into an MPEG video in form of a slides .
&quot; the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ er can be used to convert selected images into an MPEG @-@ video , with a defined length , to convert . this module used to insert the packages M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . between the individual pictures you can add a base structure . you can also add a audio file in MP@@ 2 or W@@ AV of the slides . &quot;
&quot; all images are automatically scal@@ able to the correct size for the chosen video format . additionally , you can create a background color for the slides . with this module , it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the Medi@@ ums , you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
you must first select the images to the MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . after that you can run via extras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au to generate the module .
the images chosen by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change the pictures or the contents of the list .
&quot; after you are satisfied with your list , you should download the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you are planning to select the corresponding TV standard PAL , Sec@@ am or NT@@ SC . PAL is prescribed and most probably the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step you should display the time in seconds that will display a picture . a low value creates a very su@@ dden , a high contrast , very smooth change . &quot;
the background colour can be set next . in doubt you should let them have black . the name and the path of the generated file can be set under the name of the MPEG @-@ output file . keep it as possible as possible .
&quot; if you specify a audio file under the name of audio source file , this will be integrated into the movie . after all settings you have adjusted the creation of the movie . depending on the speed of your computer , you can go back quickly or in all the peace and enjoy a coffee if you are back again . &quot;
&quot; if a note appears that Ko@@ di@@ erer or tools are missing , so you can adjust the paths to the programmes of the M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages on the right side below . &quot;
&quot; the print driver allows it to print multiple images on a sheet paper , together in standard Photo@@ sizes . the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.@@ g : useful to enhance your or to print with the Gim@@ p module for direct expression . &quot;
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import your in the RA@@ W format in one of three formats JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM or convert . &quot;
&quot; the conversion is based on the command line d@@ cra@@ b of Dave coff@@ in . an original design@@ ate of Him is : expect of d@@ cra@@ w not that it creates the same results as the software of your compan@@ er@@ ators . sometimes you get with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! &quot;
&quot; first select the RA@@ W file , and start the module . the Ra@@ w picture @-@ konver@@ ter window appears in the mode for a single image . with the button preview , you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can now optimize the values to optimize the con@@ versions of the con@@ versions . the first option decides if the camera settings are used for the white , brightness and red / blue amp@@ lif@@ iers . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the picture later . &quot;
&quot; a four @-@ colored R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected , so that you can use the contrac@@ tual information . if your camera is working in the R@@ GB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output format and save the conversion result . the filename remains unchanged and only the extension is adapted accordingly . JPEG used a lost algorith@@ m and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; the Tagged image format , TI@@ FF , reserves all the information of your image and uses the publishing free L@@ Z@@ W com@@ pression . &quot;
&quot; if you advance your images frequently to edit or use later , you should not select the JPEG format since it is only a limited number of operations before the image quality is deteri@@ or@@ ated . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the met@@ ad@@ ata can be stored in the RA@@ W file in the JPEG @-@ information file . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted your settings , you can start with the execute kno@@ b the conversion . if you want to break this process again , you can use this process . &quot;
&quot; the load mode allows you to convert different images to once . use this mode , therefore if you are sure , e.g. by testing in a single picture , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images . however , here you have the possibility of existing file automatically . it &apos;s helpful in case that this occurs in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced . &quot;
&quot; this module can be used to treat all images in an album , using the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported : &quot;
&quot; this module can be used for ren@@ aming all images of a album . you can use the pre@@ fix , the start@@ ups and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the use should be used . &quot;
&quot; this module can be used to change the size of several images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can termin@@ ate the image size or enlarge . in addition , four types of the image changes are provided : &quot;
propor@@ tional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected depending on the image orientation , selected . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
propor@@ tional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : biggest change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format .
not propor@@ tional : not propor@@ tional demand in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
&quot; preparation : preparing the image for the photo pressure . the user can adjust the printing solution and the size of the phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ers . the target image , including background size , random size and background color , is adjusted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your favorite e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the sending images previously .
&quot; after which you started the module , the images can be displayed by you selected images . you can add multiple images with a file @-@ op@@ tionally dialog . for the last requested image will be shown on the right side . &quot;
you can also drag images to the picture list and add it to the list of the images to be processed .
with the button pictures you will remove the selected images from the list of the pictures .
&quot; after you have selected all the pictures , you can open with the button OK to open the new message window to your e @-@ mail clients . you have to add here only the addresses and the Bet@@ re@@ ff . the pictures you have selected are attached as an app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
don &apos;t pay attention to many pictures at one time . most e @-@ mail account have limitations for the size of the e @-@ mails . it is possibly a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window will be used to modify the settings for the sending of the images . your configuration is stored and every time will be used until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you choose Thunder@@ bird so you have to specify in the input field below the right path for your installation .
&quot; if you use the Google Mail Service , you need to install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after receipt of comments in a shared file , the comments are attached to the pictures into a text file and the mail are attached . &quot;
&quot; PN@@ G format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo@@ files , but it &apos;s best adjusted among the lost free formats like TI@@ FF . you should therefore use PN@@ G when you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality is not changed . otherwise , we recommend you the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG format and select the original files in the JPEG format , then the original Ex@@ if@@ design@@ ates will be added to the pictures . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window is not automatically closed so you can view the stat@@ ues , on the search for errors , view . your e @-@ mail chess program will automatically start at the end . with the button closing , you can shoot this window t@@ lie ? &quot;
&quot; after starting the module advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window will be shown with questions like you want your Di@@ asch@@ au . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album . &quot;
&quot; the option OpenGL transi@@ tions used in the presentation are enabled very elegant not@@ ices via OpenGL . however , you have to possess a corresponding graphics card , as otherwise the slides can be very slowly . &quot;
the filename show that the filename of images in the lower left corner during the presentation is displayed .
the vei@@ ls option makes it shown that the presentation in an end@@ los@@ loop is displayed . you can then cancel it manually with Es@@ c ; Canc@@ el .
&quot; the option images happen to be selected , that the images are shown in a random order . so it is not used the order of images in the album . &quot;
&quot; under delay between the images , the tempor@@ al distance between the individual images can be set up . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transi@@ tional effect . you should do so before you show the presentation of your friends ! &quot;
there are more than a do@@ zen transi@@ tions between which you can choose . by chance , choosing a different effect between the pictures . &quot;
&quot; during the slides , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn off . &quot;
&quot; with this work@@ load you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slides . &quot;
&quot; on the left side of the screen , you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the entire number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date j@@ us@@ ability currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ org@@ . attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module wall@@ et is a tool to put an image as a background @-@ screen for the work of work .
&quot; this module puts the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menus , as the background for your KDE work@@ station . &quot;
&quot; once you have made your pictures and videos with notes , you can see with &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; see picture . as you can see by comparison with the image , so in person , places , and in the group called entries . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window you will see the categories , for which you have given information as you made your pictures and videos with notes . additionally , there are entries to look at EX@@ IF @-@ bas@@ ing information to look at your hard drive and of course to look at the current demonstration pictures . in the following , each one is described for themselves . &quot;
&quot; when you press the mouse on the entry people , the view of the browser is changing . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you choose another person only the images displayed on which both persons are displayed . by this selection method , you can restri@@ ct the number of images of some thousand pictures to a few separate images . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all persons , places and other settings , you can view the pictures to look at the pictures of your activity . &quot;
&quot; in the picture every person has the same symbol in front of their name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can save a separate pre@@ image , that also applies to places , keywords and other categories that you are defined . see the picture . &quot;
&quot; in order to view images in addition to the name , select the button that you want to use the right outside on the workshop . note that you can see the view for each category separately . this has the advantage that you can see for example symbols with images of people and simultaneously a list of keywords ( if you have no suitable pictures for your keywords ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you will have to define what image can be displayed for each individual person . now , you can see the image @-@ saf@@ est window ( in more described ) . here you can choose the image format according to your wishes and thus choose which part of the picture can be displayed and be cut off . &quot;
&quot; if you call the entry in the main window , you will see a dialog , which is very similar to the dialog for the determination of the image properties very similar . this dialog can be seen at the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you enter a string into the field lab@@ eling or description , the descriptions or descriptions of the pictures are search@@ ed after this text . if you want , the date may be either part of the total date , i.e. , for example , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; browse the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all pictures according to specific names as you can see in the picture . here , the Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album . if you do not like to read manu@@ als , but also prefer to try functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album , and have a look at the quick@@ start , the screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; and select in the first dialog the demo , in case you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu Help file . then you will start using the menu and you can taste the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; as an integral HTML document to download . &quot;
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the timeline . a picture of this body you can see here : . as the name tells you here : . as the name tells you shows the body statistics about the pictures in your database .
&quot; the timeline can display you several different times . each body shows a different unit . you can switch between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by default only 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot;
&quot; the timeline can be inter@@ active in the following ways : you can change the entries view view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date in preview display shows ) and also displays the current date of the currently shown images , if you navig@@ ate in preview . &quot;
&quot; you can also select an area of the time bar by clicking the mouse button and select the mouse over the ruler of the timeline , i.e. the duration of the timeline . you can break the selection , by clicking on a beams of the timeline . &quot;
&amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; provide you with two options available to create HTML web pages with your images . one is integrated in &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version is described in &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version described above the menu File to create HTML ...
&quot; before HTML pages you need to make some settings . these are divided into three areas of content , layout and destination . in the following , each area is described more accurately . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of the surplus and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML @-@ example pages see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , select from whether a &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ export file should be created on the revision page . see the information about the export files you can find in . &quot;
&quot; finally , you can select what information on the HTML pages are to be displayed . thus , you can avoid that information is displayed on the viewer . for example all images are ex@@ ported . at the moment , all images are ex@@ ported . you can therefore use this option not to hide certain pictures from certain viewers . &quot;
&quot; in this area , you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most of the options are un@@ ambig@@ uous , which is why this is not specially made . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions on the pictures . thus , those who have to view your website and possess a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x@@ 600 for example , no images can download for example a resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer of your side may change the resolution at any time . it can thus also change your pictures with low resolution , resulting in a lower transmission period . if he wants to show a picture bigger than it changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this item area , you place the different folder and the URL where your website is stored . &quot;
&quot; best to all your HTML files , select a base folder and for each subsequent sentence a new sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; first of all , you will need to select the main folder in which all your pictures will be saved . this folder is saved and automatically set up for all future pictures . this folder you can select either a folder or a KDE suppor@@ tive protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your pictures , you can check if this really is a URL if you have been created for the basic folder after the pages have been started . the URL you can specify here , this folder should be selected . otherwise , the navig@@ ator will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML @-@ files are still not in the final destination folder , you have to manually copy them manually . so that the import function , see , right will need to indicate the final goal of the files , but the basic folder in which all sub@@ folder can be found . &quot;
&quot; the options described in these options are related to all three of the basic folder or URL@@ s . in these , a sub@@ folder , whose name you specify in output @-@ folder . &quot;
&quot; if you are interested in a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . together , you might want to create a HTML page for viewing the images , etc . you can of course use a HTML page for viewing the images , etc . then you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work cannot even be done . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album , you can export a copy of your pictures into a .k@@ im file . you can import other into your database . the properties are being import@@ ed with ex@@ - and import@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; there are two different types of .k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in it if the images are stored in the file , or if you have a link to images . the advantage all images to be stored in the file , and that file can be dis@@ close to the file , but the obvious disadvantage is the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can export a .k@@ im file directly from the menu File or together with HTML pages , see , create a .k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this will be an external .k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .k@@ im file sear@@ ches the images in two f@@ ache way . first , the images are not found in the folder of the .k@@ im file . if the corresponding images are not found , so the images of the URL you will look through to create the HTML files . this is of course only possible if you have created your .k@@ im file via HTML @-@ Export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , dialogue for the export of pictures described you can export via the menu File ... &quot;
the most important option of this dialogue is whether it is to act in internal or external .k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
&quot; when added Manu@@ ell , you can copy the images to the same folder as the .k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; with the option Autom@@ atically to copy the .k@@ im @-@ File , copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically for you . &quot;
&quot; .k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most pictures already have been com@@ pressed and the XML file itself is very small , it usually does not want to com@@ press the files , so you simply choose the file un@@ com@@ press option . &quot;
&quot; the last option of this page is Maxim@@ ale Viol@@ et . if you want to send your friends pictures , as the .k@@ im -@@ Datei otherwise would be very big . here you can limit the size by saying that every picture is a maximum 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
if you select a file with the end .k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu File Im@@ port@@ ing ... select &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the ex@@ ported database as described in described .
&quot; the assistant to the imports consists of four steps . first , you must select which images you want to import , then in which folder the import@@ ing pictures will be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you are the category person who are to import@@ ing the category person , while this category is called for your database . therefore , you will be import@@ ed in the third dialogue window , which categories of import@@ ing file will be import@@ ed in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can import the categories of import@@ ing file with the categories of your current database . an example of this can be seen on the picture . &quot;
&quot; it must be easy to browse images and look at : if you look at pictures , one would often like to see pictures of your Italy &apos;s holiday and to discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures , on which this friend is pictur@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; this manual will give you the various steps from ( 1 ) Fest@@ ing the information about your images , about ( 2 ) the flow and look , up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and adaptation opportunities . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album was started as a program for the wo@@ und of your pictures . however , it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos . many places in this manual is spoken about images but often does this also close videos . &quot;
&quot; photo@@ photo@@ copy ; saves all its information in index@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of their images . this is a simple XML file that you can copy using a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a disk or re@@ visions in CV@@ S . &quot;
&quot; photo@@ photo@@ album ; mer@@ ged the folder that are stored in which your pictures are saved and used this in future starting line . if you want to read another database in &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album . if you want to read another database of pictures , so you can start a different folder . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / index@@ .x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; via the menu settings settings k@@ photo@@ album ; entered into a window , with which you can change the settings of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album . change in the following section of the user name , the different settings are explained . &quot;
&quot; to the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can view entries of preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available to the F1 button and a click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; it has been described as you can set up different properties , e.g. persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; to see the dialog , which is used to already existing groups . for each existing group you can choose a lab@@ eling and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section sub@@ categories are already mentioned . in the dialog options , you can set complete membership groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of being explained in one group instead , as in explained . &quot;
&quot; in the list of options available , the list of the members are available to you . with the above listed selection list , you can select the category you can configure . in the left window is a list of the current category and in the right list of sub@@ categories . &quot;
&quot; photo@@ photo@@ album ; shares his module with other graphic applications , such as Management K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . availability information can be found on the homepage of K@@ ip@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the modules can be accessed via the menu modules . the modules can be used and are not described in this manual , since they are not part of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; however , are not part of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can call on the modules themselves . &quot;
&quot; since the modules are shared between multiple applications each other , it can be used to test the modules with &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; only very little tested them . therefore , you can either test new modules with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album . demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu Help . do not tell me , I could not have war@@ ned ! &quot;
&quot; the applications that use the modules above K@@ IP@@ I , are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not work . this is the down@@ side if you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are not supported in albums : this type of order is not supported , simul@@ ated it for some modules the order to have albums , so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; thereby simul@@ ated &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album that simply corresponds to the current view , i.e. all images that shows you the picture gallery . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also has a list of albums . here goes online &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album : as follows : &quot;
&quot; if it shows the content of a category , for example all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will have the category that you have defined in the setup dialog as a category for virtual albums , so if you have to use the category persons , so if you have selected individuals and pass this to the module . &quot;
&quot; as some modules are compatible with &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible can you remove them from the list of the modules . start the entry dialog , and select in the area of modules that modules can be loaded . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you can see an example of a starting screen , as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; as you are used by any other KDE application , you can see a menu on top of a menu and a tool@@ bar . at the moment , it does not contain very many information , since you will not have any information about your pictures . in the section , we will not click on the entry pictures , which shows you an overview with all existing pictures . &quot;
&quot; one of the following functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to show every picture with notes . this includes information about the individuals who have taken on the picture , etc . you can either add any image individually or for a larger number of images . if for example on all images Jes@@ per is listed , and all pictures in Copenhagen were included . &quot;
&quot; all of these comments can be read for the search and brow@@ ses , as you can read in paragraph . if you want to see this notes if you use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; see three lists with a text box by setting up people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; because you will always use them again if you submit information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea lies the move of the pictures within the list . if you have a family party and are shown on all 50 pictures of the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , so you can find that the names used to be moved up , the persons can quickly find and to arrange . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer a alphabe@@ tically available list , click on the icon for sorting after date below the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected any comments on each image individually , you might wish to edit all selected images and add these pictures with notes . simply click on the front and back buttons , which are located under the preview of the picture right at the top . &quot;
&quot; if you have several pictures , e.g. with the same person , then it can convenient to mark all these pictures and select the menu item multi @-@ file entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . besides , San Francisco and Los Angeles are available in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you can see a browser window of the USA as a super@@ group . to show you that it is a super @-@ group , a special symbol is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of fix@@ ing di@@ alog@@ s is also possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also add an entry to a category and put there to make this one sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this continues that you just sort your categories alphabe@@ tically . see this . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the set @-@ di@@ alog@@ s by changing the body , which form the upper edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make a separate window by taking it outside the window . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the look of the window so adapted to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button options ... that offers you the opportunity to store the current structure and look of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also let a frame also completely bl@@ ending . if you want to see this window later , use the button options ... and here are window a / hide . this process can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select the entry pictures in the browser , you get an overview with the picture images of the currently selected images , or all images if you do not have a filter here . you can configure the size of the screen@@ shots , by simply down pul@@ ling the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . try it easy . &quot;
&quot; if you have a picture on the background of your desktop , this picture is set up as a background @-@ picture for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; click on a picture , this is displayed in the picture viewer . if you have not yet opened a window with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
you can delete pictures in the picture gallery . simply select the appropriate pictures from you and press either the removal button or select the menu Edit selection . now the window will display you in the picture you can see in the picture .
&quot; photo@@ photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can also use the images stored on your hard disk . of course , you can also have stored the pictures somewhere , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . in the picture you can see the images of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all necessary images can be loaded from the hard disk . &quot;
&quot; images , in which the right upper corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard drive . however , for example 5 @-@ 9 are the pres@@ tations available , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . however , you can view the preview of this images . however , you can view these pictures with the image viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you need to see this feature that you copy files from the folders and copy again . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; therefore , it &apos;s not yet to ask for the place of the concerned CD . if you would like to avoid trouble passing the question of your images , please buy a bigger hard disk to save all the pictures . &quot;
&quot; in the menu images you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to stay a little more privacy , you can see the pictures that you want to do for other un@@ accessible and click on the view of the menu . alternatively , you can also select all the images that you can see your little sister , cont@@ agi@@ ous and the menu . &quot;
&quot; in this way , you have defined , which images in the case of F@@ all will be hidden . if you are using the lap@@ top now your little sister , simply select the menu items you will have locked , hidden . if you want to see the pictures again , click on sperm . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to set up a password that must be given to dish@@ on@@ ate the pictures . to set up this password , simply select your password in the menu of privacy . &quot;
&quot; please note that this picture is no means very safe . for one are all images on the hard drive and to the other anyone can read the password as un@@ encryp@@ ted text or delete this type of password protection only , those who are familiar with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar with the view to private images . &quot;
&quot; the reason why not all your pictures with &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; manage and hours over hours to describe it is natural that you want to see it at some point . for this reason it has a picture _ and vide@@ ob@@ oom . these can be seen from the preview , as described in . &quot;
&quot; the viewer will see you in . it shows of course the image , but additional all the information you have about the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the Info@@ Box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , so you can easily pull it with your mouse and can edit them differently . all these options are shown after a right click on the viewer . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Info@@ Box are under@@ lined . if you click here , see the right entries to this . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all images of Anne Hel@@ ene . if you have selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have loaded several pictures in the viewer , you can switch between them and go back by using the keys picture high and image . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also available from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run this as slides . as often it can press a new image after a few seconds . how often it can press a new image by pressing the Str@@ g button and Plus or minus . started and stopped by the keys C@@ tr@@ l ; S . &quot;
&quot; a very useful capability of the spect@@ ator of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; in this mode , the viewer is used to switch the complete space on the screen . simply use the entry button to switch to the full @-@ mode and return . &quot;
&quot; if you use the viewer , you can start in the picture and turn off . with the mouse button you can simply drag a rect@@ angle . with the minus button you can drag the Plus button zo@@ om@@ t into the middle of the picture . shows how an Zoom rect@@ angle indicates , and shows the result of the zo@@ oms . &quot;
&quot; with the point button you can reset your z@@ oom , so that the picture is not shown zo@@ zo@@ om@@ t . with the equ@@ ator sets the zo@@ oms , allowing every Pixel on the screen of an image of the picture . &quot;
note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations work with videos that works in and extrac@@ ting a zo@@ oming with the Plus@@ - and Minu@@ st@@ aste .
with the screen@@ ings from the context menu you can rot@@ ate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make notes to the current picture with the menu item notes from the context menu .
&quot; if you have a look at the picture , you can find a picture with a person whose name you will have forgotten on the picture . at the moment you can watch the watch and configure the configuration dialog of the image to mark this name . however , you will not only consider the picture to mark and see more pictures . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer in order to see the pictures on paper . to see which photos you want to start watching the viewer with the images and see it as good or bad , while you see one by one . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer displays the possibility of images with features while you see them . features include the letters A to Z and you can put a characteristic that you press the corresponding letters . in view a picture with which the features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; once you have set features on your images , these are available to you in your browser . so you can see all the pictures you want , print or whatever you want to edit them . this is described in . afterwards , you can use one module to copy the selected images to a CD or what you just want to do . &quot;
categories and special features can be displayed in the demonstration show . if you are looking for categories in d@@ re pre@@ viewing view . then you can easily add the letters to the images once the picture was selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case allows you to paint on the picture .
&quot; the painted is not stored with the image , but in the database . in the way you can do your comfort later . &quot;
&quot; in order to view a picture on the painted . in order to turn the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; please turn off the image paint from the context menu . to finish the painting , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar above on the window . &quot;
&quot; to work with &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er , you must not completely master the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not completely master but the documentation for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you should definitely read and understood . &quot;
&quot; in the building tree , you can select single objects . then their properties are displayed in the lenses and display the object in the wire@@ feed views yellow . &quot;
&quot; you can also select several objects simultaneously . but not the under@@ object of an already selected object , since all the sub@@ object were already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to add a new object to the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu menu in the menu . &quot;
&quot; there is m@@ eh@@ re possible positions , the following starts @-@ menu appears , so that you can choose the right position : &quot;
with delet@@ ing either from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button you can choose from selected objects from the scene .
&quot; if you have changed properties , click to apply these changes . do you have inv@@ ali@@ d values , a message will be displayed with a bug description . then you can click the input file and to apply the changes to Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ User &apos;s documentation in the use dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ reference to the shown object with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user interface to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 contains already the user &apos;s documentation . &quot;
&quot; edit a texture or part of a texture , you can view a preview in the peculi@@ ar view . &quot;
&quot; press preview in the peculi@@ ar view , and a small example of the scene will be framed with the chosen texture . as default , the entire texture will be selected . if you only want to add a part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross the entire texture . &quot;
the screen@@ shot shows the control points of the camera . you can draw these check@@ points with the mouse and thus change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is chosen , the control points and there will be a small cross in the spiral model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shi@@ fts . you can change the shift through pul@@ ling with the mouse within the whole window . &quot;
&quot; each object has a machine model . you can indicate this value relative to the visibility of the higher level object or as absolute value . objects are only shown , if they are selected or their visibility is smaller or equal in the work@@ manship of the scene of the scene . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; has a window order as default . the object tree and view of the lenses are shown on the left , and the four graphic views are shown on the right . &quot;
&quot; if you do not like the default column order or if you need a different arrangement , you can also adjust it any number . you can also store multiple cut@@ ters and simply switch between different arrangements . &quot;
&quot; to an@@ chor a window above or under a present view , drag the starter to the top or lower edge of a view . a rect@@ angle indicates the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the f@@ ool to the right or left side of a view . the new view will then be anch@@ ored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the overall height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange several views over each other , drag the lo@@ f@@ le in the middle of another view . you can then change between the views through clicking on the card box . &quot;
&quot; the final possible window order are sh@@ ou@@ ching views : views , which are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to view a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the starter on the desktop or click on the small left top arrow at the An@@ fi@@ ser@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the fibre bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between arrow and cross . &quot;
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the menu view you will find entries for any type of views . new views are flo@@ ating you can an@@ chor it to any place .
&quot; the current window view can save you with view window order , save ... it will be a dialog , where you can save the window order under an existing or new name . &quot;
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ dering them . &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ dering , this program has to be installed properly . this version is currently not supported in &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 not supported . &quot;
&quot; to ren@@ dering the current scene , click on the icon to ren@@ dering the symbol of Ren@@ ters in the tool@@ bar or select the menu view scene . &quot;
&quot; a R@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . he determines the beautiful and quality of ren@@ dering . if you want to ren@@ dering a scene in different formats and quality levels , you can insert as many R@@ ender Mo@@ di , from a fast preview to full @-@ images in the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the icon The R@@ ender settings in the tool@@ bar , or select the menu View R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... select the following dialog : &quot;
&quot; each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but is a name that can recognize the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in map @-@ card size , you can add the width and height of the clear@@ er image . if you want to ren@@ dering a small area of the picture , select the cross @-@ section sub@@ section and give the image section to ren@@ dering into the input field . &quot;
&quot; in the construction field quality you can select the properties , the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for ren@@ dering time . this is about a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reviews . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the user manual for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; &quot;
&quot; if an image is separated with only one beam per pixels , these images can often arise . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or cur@@ ved effect in cur@@ ves and lines , besides , details are not shown when they are in the representation smaller than one pixels . this effect is called aliens . &quot;
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . in general images with this feature is better off .
&quot; when you turn anti @-@ ali@@ asing , and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a beam per pixels . this technique is called super @-@ samp@@ ling . &quot;
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ samp@@ ling . as a standard is a adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because every Pixel again is divided again and adap@@ tive because the rec@@ ti@@ fication depends on the predic@@ ted color values . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , pursu@@ es POV @-@ Ray a ray each pixels . if the difference between the color indicate the variable pi@@ xel is processed with super @-@ samp@@ ling , then a grid of 4x4 additional points will be charged , at a low value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixels . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pi@@ xel is calculated : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pi@@ xel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixels . the difference is then : &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixels . if the difference between the color indicate the specified thres@@ hold , then the pixels be divided into 4 sub@@ pi@@ xel , which can be followed individually and on further sub@@ division , you can adjust the maximum depth of the record . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the ali@@ asing effect , the production of smo@@ kes for the beam process , called J@@ EC@@ ing . if you turn J@@ EC@@ ing , changed &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
&quot; the final setting for quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use Re@@ flex@@ ion . this is an experim@@ ental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; , the diff@@ use light reflex@@ ion . it takes a long time to make a scene with this feature . &quot;
on this map card you can adjust whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . one pixels is then transparent when the associated radiation have not met an object .
&quot; opens a new window for viewing the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ Kon@@ sol@@ en@@ ica . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expected , you can find the reason for this . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ scene to import , select the &quot; &quot; menus &quot; &quot; menu ... and choose a file in the dialog window . &quot;
&quot; currently , &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; still does not support the complete satisfaction of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; if at the imports of radio or war@@ nings , a dialog window shows a list of all messages . &quot;
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ enter and / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ End .
&quot; you can export objects from the object in the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds the source code of the object to the opened text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , just highlight the source text in the editor and drag it to the object tree . &quot;
with copying and insert in &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can insert the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called if &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; a scene does . usually this P@@ ov@@ ray or x @-@ P@@ ov@@ ray .
&quot; if you click on the help in the self @-@ view view , open &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; User &apos;s documentation for the shown object . put here the path to your documentation and the version . it will be supported the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; sear@@ ches for external files ( for example al@@ location data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also specify the path to these files here . if a file is used in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for viewing the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the view in the camera view and in the window type labels .
you can adjust the item points to the rec@@ aster in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the rec@@ aster separately for shi@@ fts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; larger values are a more precise point@@ ing model and therefore a better se@@ ams for the shown objects , but require more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the detailed level for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you find the high level of details for extended proj@@ ections , all proj@@ ections are further divided into account when the camera is an extended proj@@ ection . extended proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions to the perspective and the vertical proj@@ ections . this property gives a better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time to ren@@ dering . &quot;
&quot; when you view a wall , a wall is depic@@ ted behind the objects . the wall is displayed in a box pattern of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; when you view ground floor , a soil is defined below the objects . the floor is represented in a box pattern of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you activate the cant@@ on , the non @-@ recur@@ sive Anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for ren@@ dering the scenes . the values for depth and sw@@ elling can be set . accurate information about the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section . &quot;
&quot; on this page , you can change existing greg@@ ations or create new window regulations . in the section of window regulations , it is explained how you can create fir@@ es regulations and save it . &quot;
the Com@@ men@@ field Standard window arrangement : displays all existing specifications . &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; uses the chosen window order at the start of the program .
the list of final form@@ ations displays all existing specifications . a new arrangement can add with the button adding and delete a selected order with the button remo@@ ver .
any fl@@ ush order is identified by the name . the name must be clearly and may not be empty .
the list under the name shows all views of the chosen window arrangement . new opinions can be saved with the button adding and select selected views with the button remo@@ ver .
&quot; the position of the new window . with new column , you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with spra@@ yers , you get the window under the existing window , with cardboard card , you get a cardboard box along with the previous view and flo@@ ating the view not in the main window , but generates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so they have just been &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; col@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; and now you want to start out more accurate knowledge of the two programs . if you are able to create simple scene , however , you should be very popular : a sphere at one level . &quot;
&quot; however , you should carefully consider the following war@@ nings carefully before you complain that you use as a result only one black screen . if you use a 3D program for first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not adjust any camera , no rules can be applied to ren@@ dering ren@@ dering as a result you get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you do not insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have all error @-@ free , take a look at the first start of &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; the following set of window : &quot;
&quot; take a little time to get to know the menus and the available symbols of the work@@ loads . read the documentation , so that you can expect an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&quot; &amp; col@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the item tree . so you have a scene without objects . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene which you generate . in particular , you notice the scene from the view of the camera ( right down ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this is the result of the ren@@ der@@ ns of the scene . &quot;
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if they click on , see the contents of view obj@@ ection@@ ery in which the various parameters of the camera find . in the user &apos;s documentation for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; please find further details . &quot;
&quot; change anything to the basic settings of the camera , this is later instructions reserved , but note that you can change the camera in view of control points , with which you can change the target point of the camera . simply click with the left mouse button of the camera , and drag it to the desired location . &quot;
&quot; when you apply the button or press the button , change the spiral views and the object tree immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could include a Qu@@ ader ( Inser@@ ted body Qu@@ ader ) and size at x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a comprehen@@ sible method to resolve this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; offers in fact a simple way . you can use an infinite level as the floor :
&quot; a good advice : select the level in the item tree , change the name and then press the button or use the button . in the item tree , the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the point@@ ing view shows now also the level , even though at the moment only as a limited scale . if you ren@@ dering the scene , the plain down to the horiz@@ on . &quot;
&quot; if you view the item tree , you will find that you click on the icon that you click on the icon . in this case , you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will see one of these options , also change the possible settings in view of the property . &quot;
&quot; in this scene , you should move the ground to exercise a unit among the horiz@@ on , just to get to know some of these parameters . select shift and adjust the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first of all , choose the floor to set its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose a bit of look at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases a dialogue , where you can select how the object can be inserted . please select the name in the item tree ( name = floor pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview , see how the pig@@ ment looks now . &quot;
&quot; of course , the cre@@ ment of pig@@ ments only shows a Mat@@ ure black material , because you can have settings for the pig@@ ment . therefore , you can always remember that you can check the appearance of materials anytime with a click on preview . also there are many possibilities , but take it now the easi@@ est . &quot;
&quot; if you see in Pre@@ view no color on qu@@ ader and ball , click on the button button and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is right now . if you start your picture with a click on the icon , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; of course , this is not the color . you have expected . here are more settings necessary . in the color list , you will have to do two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured list . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this even more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; select in the object of jed@@ es@@ times , and change the colors in the view of the lenses : &quot;
&quot; this step should you simply be able to run , since you have understood the fundamental working method of &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; already the ball is just as simple as the floor create : &quot;
&quot; in view of the lenses , you can immediately change the settings . put the value for the radius : on 1 ( don &apos;t forget the input or use the button . otherwise , the sphere would flo@@ at touch with the ground . otherwise , the sphere would flo@@ wer@@ ve over the ground , since you moved the floor to move down a unit . &quot;
&quot; of course , the ren@@ dering now yield a strange result : as previously before , the ball surface appears like a Matt@@ el black material . put in the following step a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the sphere , you can now add a material now . as already in the ground , give the sphere a pig@@ ment as color : &quot;
&quot; select First Sub@@ object and change the name for example in sphere of pig@@ ment . click on ball pig@@ ment , select the color and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; however , you can reach more interesting effects if you take the time to add some Fin@@ ish properties : &quot;
then change the values like in the following screen photos and click on to apply the input .
&quot; the settings spl@@ end@@ or effect and reflection are already some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrom@@ ed finishes , even if metal : still not selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; col@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; and hopefully you &apos;ve already learned so much that you can create simple , but nice scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
&quot; if you have a scene ray@@ trac@@ en , sho@@ ots the ren@@ derer &apos;s hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the perspective of the spect@@ ator ( i.e. from the camera , which disc@@ usses the scenes ) through each pixels in the scene and like atmosph@@ eric effects such as fo@@ g . so the scene pixels be processed for pixels . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye out with which you look at the scene . without a light source you see nothing , the image is just black . obviously , every scene which should be framed , some light sources and at least a camera . &quot;
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file exten@@ dable * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ inc .
opens a file . in the standard file dialog you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ;
&quot; whenever you open a new model or create , the file is inserted in this sub@@ menu and re@@ places the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you already saved the model , it is stored under the same name , it is a new file , you must enter a name and storage space . &quot;
the scene has been restored in the last stored version . all changes have been modified since the last store .
&quot; please select this menu , you can only select if you have not saved changes in the scene . &quot;
&quot; repe@@ ating the last reverse order . this menu entry you can only select , if you have used Edit . &quot;
&quot; saves the current window order and opens a dialog , in which you can enter a name for a new order or write an existing arrangement . &quot;
&quot; in this menu you will find options for setting up &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; , here you can change the look , the short@@ cuts and the standard behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change or add new ones with this option .
opens a dialog to set up the work@@ loads . you can add and remove it with this option tool@@ set ; add orders and remove them .
a B@@ ump @-@ map is a way to smo@@ other surfaces with without any b@@ ump on the surface individually model@@ ed and without changing the geomet@@ rical form of object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a B@@ ump map as well as for a text map .
ground@@ body are simple geomet@@ rical forms that you can use as buil@@ ders : very complex 3D models are produced from do@@ z@@ ens or even hundreds of this basic body . these models are then further processed to give them a realistic look .
&quot; a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object set to pi@@ xel base , by applying an image file as a color map . &quot;
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and navig@@ ator . the application has a file browser where you can select pictures on display .
images can be displayed in an own window in the size of the image or in the full @-@ mode mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can view with clicking on &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the button return .
&quot; you can adjust if any image should be displayed in a separate window , or if all images always use the same window . &quot;

you can check the status of your scanner on the SAN@@ E project page by using the necessary information on this search page : http : / / www.s@@ ane @-@ cer@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / driver@@ .pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; set in terminal . if this scanner can not be opened or if no standard scanner is specified then a dialog to choose a scanner .
the user can select the scanner and push OK to open the scanner . break down &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options especially .
&quot; to insert a picture , the user can only start a pre @-@ shot can start and then start Scan@@ Area for final scan . the Vor@@ sch@@ aus@@ can is started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; in order to better select the picture , the user can enter into the image and out of the current selection of zo@@ oming . he can also adjust the z@@ oom that the complete preview in the window fits . &quot;
if the picture has been chosen then the final image can be read with the scan button .
&quot; if the stor@@ ing is selected a preview display in the settings , then the image is stored in a show@@ case , as shown below , then the image is stored and p@@ ly ? en leads to a break@@ down and you get back to the main window . &quot;
&quot; through the button settings , the hom@@ onymous dialogue will be opened before the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the image if desired , prior to the memory . in this case the option does not want to view a preview . if this Pre@@ view is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected . &quot;
&quot; this option allows to select them the way to select them . dialog to store each photo will open the dialogue in front of each one @-@ called image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite , this automatically opens with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you will need to ask for a file name . &quot;
&quot; this option defines where the images can be saved from the Option or saved without a filename , then this folder is used as standard for dialogue to save . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines an image fix for the automatic pictures and is also the proposed name for the image within the dialog to store . the automatically stored picture gets a numer@@ ical Su@@ ff@@ ix of every time . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers . &quot;
&quot; the user can adjust the image quality of image quality . this value also changes the com@@ pression value when counting . if Cho@@ ose the image quality is not selected , then the default value is used . &quot;

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; it uses a list of these cuts and their function . below you can set up a list of these cuts and their function .
you may also set up existing multimedia buttons so that they work as &amp; amar@@ ok ; this makes your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Control Centre .
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly described in other KDE programs . this section consists of six parts and is supposed to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists and scripts . an example call for the D@@ CO@@ P function could look &amp; z@@ B ; look like : &quot;
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options from Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition Amar@@ ok has some own command lines options .
&quot; you should give the user a refund if the script can not be executed by missing depen@@ dency . please check your script , whether all necessary modules are available and use c@@ dialog so that the user is not running , why a script does not run . &quot;
begin require &apos; Kor@@ un@@ dum &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; Kor@@ un@@ dum ( KDE B@@ ind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry ! # { error } &apos; exit &apos;
&quot; in the folder scripts / templates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts , or simply determine the required functions . you will quickly find that the writing of scripts is relatively easy . &quot;
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P you can exchange your scripts with amar@@ ok and Amar@@ o@@ ok . the easi@@ est way is the use of the command d@@ co@@ p ; which should be set by each KDE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow the execution of external programmes and commands . this is usually the function ex@@ ec ( ) used . in this way can d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively easily called . here an example in Python :
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; sends messages posted to all current scripts . for this reason , scripts should be monitored and react according to events . of course , a script should also ignore the events if there is no use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure shows the script to display the setup dialog . if a script is started to take care . if a script is started , Amar@@ o@@ bey the work@@ folder on the folder , where all data should be stored . &quot;
track@@ able Change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is played . the script could now ask for more information on the new piece ( for example the met@@ ad@@ ata or the length ) .
vol@@ um@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume sign@@ alizes a change of volume . the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ ize : sub@@ menu item@@ Tit@@ le . disclosure the path to the selected files of the playlist settings . to add an entry to remove your entry . to add an entry to remove d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Item ( sub@@ menu item@@ Tit@@ le ) .
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; finished , or if the user stops a script , sends me &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to handle the script . this signal should be processed , for example the memory of data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ oks script management can also install script packages that can be com@@ pressed for the user &amp; z@@ B ; such packages are basically normal T@@ ar @-@ Archive ( .t@@ ar ) , which can be op@@ tionally available with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .b@@ z@@ 2 ) , which can be op@@ tionally available with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .b@@ z@@ 2 ) , which allows the user to recognize the archive clearly as Amar@@ ok script package . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the yield @-@ reaching amar@@ ok@@ ee . for this reason you should do your script right right correctly .
&quot; the main warning must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining to lad@@ der modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file right : &quot;
&quot; if your script is finished , you can download it on www.k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.org and attach the link to the Wik@@ i script . for your entry on k@@ de apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; script . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and is still surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music to the playlist , instead of having to work through endless menus . perhaps you are looking for a very specific title out of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos; s coll@@ ector browser and the fast search will you find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you have already some play@@ lists , but you can never decide what you want to hear ? then the playlist browser is exactly the right for you . and if you choose the decision is still difficult , select the dynamic mode and smart playlist automatically the right music based on certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many general USB devices . furthermore , many different audio systems can be used to hear like your music . this and many more useful features make Amar@@ ok for the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to experience your music ! &quot;
&quot; usually , one has to enter the basic folder of Amar@@ o@@ K sources , to compile amar@@ ok and install : &quot;
&quot; da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should have no difficulties when you encounter any trouble . if you encounter any problems you report in the &amp; k@@ de ; Mail@@ ing@@ lists . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; has like most applications activate some options that you can activate or dis@@ able for comp@@ actor with the configure script . this is a list of options available .
&quot; for some of the compile options , certain depen@@ dencies must be fulfilled so that they can be used . details can be found in the section system requirements . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates de@@ bug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; can be directed without effort to address the exchange dialog . the introduction dialog has several boxes for setting up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
&quot; player window display the player window in addition to the playlist or out . if the option is off , only the play@@ lists windows are sh@@ own@@ ed . &quot;
Stimm@@ bar@@ ometer use : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option divi@@ des the experim@@ ental function of the voting barrier .
&quot; atmosph@@ eric : this function is only available , if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . thus , this color scheme is modified for voting bar@@ ometer . &quot;
&quot; voting files in the music files : this function is only available , if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; stored with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . otherwise , the .@@ user files are stored in the settings of the corresponding music files ; stored ( usually ~ / .k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) . &quot;
&quot; external browsers : let you choose which browser by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start to be started when a browser is needed . &quot;
use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not listed in the list .
&quot; playlist when saving store , the current playlist automatically at the Be@@ ating of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; activate this option if you do not want to lose the current playlist upon completion . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files will be saved . &quot;
&quot; up @-@ to @-@ date piece of change change visible , that the playlist window will keep up @-@ up / down to keep the current piece always in the invisible folding area . &quot;
&quot; change to the context of the context of the context , automatically displays the context of the context , as soon as the next play is played . &quot;
&quot; in the section , you can adjust &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s appearance . the section is divided into three parts . &quot;
&quot; in the writing section , you can use the use of various fon@@ ts in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok . you can use Scrip@@ tures for the following section : play@@ lists windows , player window and context @-@ browser . press information ... , so you can choose to select a desired image from the drop dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of user @-@ defined color scheme , you have the qu@@ al of choice and can set up a separate color scheme . use the single @-@ fourth color selection for for@@ eground or background color . &quot;
&quot; when they continue to continue , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after the program start the play@@ back automatically with the piece on the spot , with which it was stopped at the final stop . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ window on screen display display allows you to switch off the O@@ SD . if On @-@ screen display , a preview of O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview . &quot;
&quot; the first option is the font . click to choose ... to select from the dialog to select the desired font for the O@@ SD . the cross @-@ field shadow causes , that the text in the O@@ SD is sh@@ aded . &quot;
&quot; using own colors will give you the opportunity to adjust the O@@ SD colors for writing and background . a click on the Far@@ b areas opens the dialog to the color selection . if the colors use is not enabled , the pre @-@ presented &amp; k@@ de areas will be used . &quot;
the input field text sets the text displayed in O@@ SD . by type of Plac@@ ards the O@@ SD can be adapted to suit your needs . below you will find a list of available Plac@@ eholder and what they mean .
the screen screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . thus you can specify on which screen of a multi @-@ set monitor area may appear to the O@@ SD .
the map @-@ card audio output lets you select a audio driver from the drop @-@ field . some drivers activ@@ ating other options in this map card .
the map @-@ card collection is used for setting all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of the database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , which should browse the folder . to search a folder in the collection , select the cross @-@ field next to its name . this section also contains an@@ kreu@@ zung to the entry , as with the selected folders . &quot;
browse the sub@@ folder : this causes that &amp; amar@@ ok ; both the cru@@ ising and their sub@@ folder to music is well as well .
&quot; changes : allows &amp; amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folder on changes ( e.g. if music files added or deleted ) . furthermore , an incre@@ mental search is done to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
&quot; play@@ lists : causes , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in your coll@@ ector folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection , then the play@@ lists appear later in the play@@ lists browser . &quot;
the part of the database database is used for selecting a database for the collection . the combination @-@ field driver : lets you choose between sq@@ l@@ ite or My@@ S@@ ql . if My@@ S@@ ql is selected is still needed in the sub@@ window My@@ S@@ ql furnishings .
the My@@ S@@ ql furnishings will be used for placing the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; it is used under port : the network port is inserted under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name which is made .
use username : and password : to enter the data that will be required for connection to the database .
the map @-@ card last@@ .@@ fm support the support for last@@ .@@ fm . &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; can submit the names of players to a last@@ .@@ fm server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece .
here you give your username and password for your last@@ .@@ fm profile . if you have no profile you can add one on the last@@ .@@ fm website .
&quot; to send out pieces and update the profile : this setting allows it &amp; amar@@ ok ; , the names of the split plays to your last@@ .@@ fm profile . &quot;
&quot; similar interpre@@ ters will call for activation : after activation of this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list of similar artists to the each split piece . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ fm profile to use this function . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ B ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of the functions and gallery .
&quot; Amar@@ o@@ K needs only the package K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other KDE packages . you need to install K@@ deli@@ ff ( including those contained therein , because &amp; amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide how to compile K@@ deli@@ bs minimal . &quot;
&quot; some features such as O@@ SD set ahead that your window manager will set the relevant standards of dri@@ ve@@ op@@ .org . it will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will work for example difficulties . we try to support amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these represent an excellent development environment . &quot;
probably one of your files will make a mistake in the tag@@ lib library to days . you can log the file in ~ / .k@@ de / share / iphone _ scan@@ .@@ log in . afterwards you can delete the file and create the collection again .
&quot; mostly , it is that tag@@ lib by reading the Meta @-@ info from this file . please report this bug to the tag lib @-@ developer under bu@@ gs.@@ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , then try SQ@@ Lite . the support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is something mature . &quot;
&quot; make sure that all of &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s libraries were compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if such as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with GCC 3.4 , tag@@ lib but with GCC 3.@@ 3.@@ x compiled , then leads this to overthrow the Meta @-@ information . &quot;
&quot; if you use KDE with art@@ s@@ d , then dis@@ able it automatically , if in@@ active for ... in the setting of the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ drop by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail will automatically add to a crash ) . if it is a common back@@ drop , the error will be fixed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many program write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 in Meta @-@ information , but not to sign the problem as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3@@ - &gt; new ( $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; errors in writing the tags of $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3@@ - &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UTF8 ) ; &quot;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the stat@@ us@@ bar ( random or@@ atory ) see the status quo in KDE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , you can fix the status de@@ activated on grey and semi @-@ transparent . note that in some cases it is possible to click on a symbol to show that setting their effect . &quot;
if you get these errors : amar@@ ok@@ app : icon look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ b@@ atch symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ TOR Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map then check whether Amar@@ o@@ K the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ tex@@ amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p Q@@ t .
&quot; to fix this bug , you may possibly remove any col@@ li@@ di@@ pping Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ o@@ ats the right version first . &quot;
there are some possibilities . most installation problems clarify the easi@@ est through the help of an expert your Uni@@ x@@ - or Linux distribution . you can also use help with other users or at the developers . use this forum and the IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ eno@@ de@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help to search . please enter there only one error if you have a mistake in solving a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; appears only a blan@@ k playlist . how do you get music pieces there ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left side and open the folder you want . then drag the files into the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the start@@ box has been converted into the Statis@@ tics window . you will find it under extras statistics . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of these symbols has changed with amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the evaluation by the user , while the points are automatically calculated . &quot;
&quot; to evaluate pieces , you have to display pieces in the playlist of the playlist and select column . click anywhere in the new applic@@ ants column . you can also use the Short@@ cuts Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want to remove , and then press ex@@ f on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select the playlist from the lift @-@ menu . &quot;
&quot; drag a play@@ lists file with the mouse into the playlist , and let them fall there , just as you would make it with other files . so easy it is : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , right next to the Add @-@ button , there is the button playlist . click on it . &quot;
pres@@ um@@ ably missing the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config . install the package x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . look after lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations . &quot;
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in the context menu ( via the right mouse button accessible ) . furthermore you can find it via the menu bar under extras
&quot; yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used one from the back@@ end independent approach , therefore the real question loud Wh@@ ich media types supports G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we can even support text and PN@@ G de@@ coding ! &quot;
&quot; it can ! maybe use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which are being delivered in the default no MP3 @-@ dé@@ cor ( from pat@@ ented legal reasons ) . the solution : old @-@ F2 , g@@ g : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , initi@@ ates &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s ab : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ Stream@@ er driver with the AL@@ SA S@@ ink , the device must provide a Mix@@ er . a mix@@ er allows for multiple applications to use the device at the same time and can be easily accessible via a sound@@ card module for AL@@ SA ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for AL@@ SA ( e.g. SB@@ live ) or through the d@@ mix module for AL@@ SA ( e.g. SB@@ live ) . check out the support D@@ mix for AL@@ SA . &quot;
the issue of this command should help you in search of the problem of problem and a solution . for G@@ Stream@@ er you need to specify a different s@@ ink ( e.g. oss@@ acks ) .
&quot; this is doing &amp; Amar@@ ok . already , you don &apos;t have to hear that media first will have to be de@@ coded . G@@ Stream@@ er is for most people the best choice if you &apos;re looking for a de@@ coder with little over@@ head . G@@ Stream@@ er reads the file , de@@ coded it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS de@@ coded the data first . G@@ Stream@@ er can spend directly to AL@@ SA , just as well as x@@ ine . &quot;
use either the G@@ Stream@@ er driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Sound@@ server with highest priority ( real time ) and increase the size of the sound bu@@ ffer ( real time ) and increase the size of the sound bu@@ ffer ( real time ) and increase the size of the sound bu@@ ffer ( real time ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ apper SU@@ ID is set :
&quot; with KDE 3.@@ 2.@@ x , there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia co@@ de@@ cs that can cause the play@@ back play . read this bug report . the mag@@ ni@@ ces of the sound bu@@ ff@@ ers in your AL@@ SA @-@ setup file . bu@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help . &quot;
&quot; do not use the Arts driver , but instead of G@@ Stream@@ er or x@@ ine or x@@ ine , or install KDE @-@ Multimedia complete to get the quicker Arts @-@ Code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ r.@@ so &amp; etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts bu@@ ffer in control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller of the bu@@ ffer , the less applications react the visu@@ alis@@ ations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stream@@ er is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stream@@ er driver , stor@@ my &amp; Amar@@ ok ; from why ? &quot;
after installing G@@ Stream@@ er you have to register all the components . lead to register to register all the Stream@@ er components .
&quot; read the G@@ Stream@@ er FAQ . if that does not help , you can also ask at IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; try this ( exit Amar@@ ok previously ! ) : - Download up ff@@ m@@ peg down , compile and install it . run the module folder by G@@ Stream@@ er all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder with g@@ st @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run off @-@ register again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok . &quot;
please report about them under bu@@ gs.@@ c@@ de.@@ org@@ . if you have a whole list of proposals / wishes you send them best to our mail@@ ing@@ list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ forge@@ .net .
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I really like it and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic K ... : ) &quot;
&quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . place an alarm in your calendar program and run with the alarm of this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play &quot;
&quot; this command leaves &amp; amar@@ ok ; the play@@ back . make sure that &amp; amar@@ ok ; run before you go to bed , then you &apos;ll have awak@@ ened by the gentle pots of the music that you have stopped in front of the bed . &quot;
how to learn the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; ongoing title if you &apos;re on another computer ?
if a functioning SS@@ H environment is available , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you interpre@@ t and title of the current piece of : ss@@ h -@@ I ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ used name Amar@@ ok player now@@ Play@@ ing
replace IP address with your IP and I@@ hr@@ username with your username . this is ahead that your identification to the file ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA exists .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; close to the window . press d on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens up in an independent , in the size of the changing window . &quot;
the combination of str@@ g + right mouse button provides a piece in the cli@@ ck@@ rate into the queue for a search in the playlist after a search in the playlist will be the first search results and the search back .
&quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ ck@@ rich features , but what about the icon in the system @-@ section of the control bar ? &quot;
click with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browsers are shown .
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and on the console appear many radio . what &apos;s now ?
&quot; the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you have to do ~ / .k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok on a local drive , or use amar@@ o@@ K@@ s MySQL support . &quot;
&quot; put the CD one , then click on Audio @-@ CD . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . you can select a few pieces and drag them into the desired destination in a con@@ quer@@ or window . to automatically add files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g . &quot;
&quot; Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ string ( &quot; SELE@@ CT play@@ counter , creat@@ ed@@ ate , &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; basically , this will fit the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ish value based on how often the piece has been played . the more frequently the piece has been played , the less influence has each individual rating on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can change the review for a piece by yourself by clicking on a sp@@ read@@ ten@@ ance in the play@@ lists window . then , select the evaluation of a piece , just like all other attributes , namely by clicking on the piece and click on the button . you can edit the evaluation on dialog met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; the developers do not want to submit you , when you want to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : KDE packages have set a fixed release plan of the non @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok . &quot;
&quot; this is a new feature in Amar@@ o@@ K that some users can also find anno@@ ying , but de@@ activate the option symbol of playing animated in general settings . &quot;
&quot; analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select the Settings same , and take the desired changes there . &quot;
&quot; download a design , or create an own . install this then under Amar@@ o@@ ok ... appearance in context @-@ browser design , click on new design .... &quot;
the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graph@@ ics Inc . ( elec@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) too similar . to avoid difficulties it was removed .
&quot; Kon@@ quer@@ ors Navigation Area enables you to view monitoring and monitoring of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; while in the con@@ quer@@ or brow@@ ses . then , click on the button settings ( the top ) and select F@@ 9 to add the navigation menu . click Amar@@ ok ; &quot;

&quot; if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest version . old AL@@ SA versions have caused a lot of ap@@ t@@ els and therefore a lot of troub@@ les@@ hooting . &quot;
probably I was compiled &amp; amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer . therefore the use / configure routine is not compiled . you need to configure &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new configur@@ ing and install .
now I have been installed &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new but the output modules appear still not . and now ?
&quot; probably you use a distribution that installed the development files installed from the actual program . although G@@ Stream@@ er is installed , the same applies for x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that , you need to compile x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that , you must re@@ compile and install again . &quot;
I get the error G@@ Stream@@ er @-@ Cri@@ tical * * : factory for &apos; ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stream@@ er has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ ics that is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stream@@ er . you have to compile G@@ Stream@@ er without pads . a tip of mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : Ver@@ wen@@ d@@ ne do not compile an L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile amar@@ ok .
I received the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp4 , although the module g@@ stream _ fa@@ ad is installed . &quot;

you will receive There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
&quot; you play a MP3 stream , but the module g@@ stream @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run as a system administrator g@@ st register . then start Amar@@ ok new . &quot;
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use Amar@@ ok the second sound card ?
among settings Amar@@ ok set ... audio output add the device . typical is e.g. HW : 0 for the standard sound@@ card and HW : 1 for the second .
here you can see an example of ~ / .@@ download@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with a on@@ board AC@@ 97 @-@ co@@ dec and a USB audio device :

&quot; if you are looking to search for entries that include space , then close the search term with gri@@ ps : Mike Old@@ field . thus , after entries , the Mike Old@@ field does not take , but after entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field . &quot;
&quot; if you specify a certain seek@@ er , you can also look for larger or smaller . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ th This sear@@ ches according to mos@@ quit@@ oes that have a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a piece , you do not want a specific search term , make a minus sign before the search term : -@@ somewhat sear@@ ches for mos@@ quit@@ oes that something not included . &quot;
&quot; you can combine these Syn@@ tax@@ gi@@ ants after exposure to each other . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this is looking for all the pieces , which contain either Mike Old@@ field , or a higher rating as 50 and not included the comment . &quot;

&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program bur@@ ns audio or data @-@ CD @-@ R@@ s in a flow ( also disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a text @-@ like description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&quot; &amp; cd@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : br@@ ates all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; cd@@ record ; it has all functions that also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o , offers , and extended these functions even . hence , &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o , does not automatically reach &amp; cd@@ record ; for burning CD . in some cases &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o , however , has achieved a higher quality when recycl@@ ed audio CDs . &quot;
cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audi@@ od@@ ats of a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Dis@@ Disc Digital Audio ) . on the Internet are such programs in general as a ri@@ pper .
&quot; O@@ GG preference to library : O@@ GG preference is a completely open , pat@@ ented and professional technology for audio enco@@ ding and for dealing with audio data flows . this library is used by the O@@ g@@ g pre @-@ de@@ oder@@ - and en@@ coder modules . &quot;
mad : this is a high quality MPEG @-@ audio de@@ coder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers layers I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 Decoder module . &quot;
name : a far more developed MP3 Decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial entities . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 @-@ Encoder module .
&quot; FL@@ AC : a free open source co@@ dec for publishing @-@ free audio com@@ pression and de@@ com@@ pression . it is used by FL@@ AC @-@ Decoder module , and the external audio @-@ en@@ coder module , so that you can read FL@@ AC files . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ bs@@ nd@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FL@@ AC , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : further libraries for the processing of different audio formats . with ff@@ m@@ peg , it is possible for example , W@@ MA files to en@@ code it then to a audio CD to burning _ de@@ co . &quot;
&quot; so@@ x : a relief program that can hin@@ ge between different audio formats and convert . so@@ x is used by the so@@ x Audio Encoder module . &quot;
trans@@ code : a command line program for video engineering . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
&quot; V@@ CD@@ Im@@ ager : a fully equipped author system for Edit , Dis@@ assem@@ bling and analy@@ zing video @-@ CDs and super @-@ video CDs . &quot;
&quot; standardi@@ zation : this tool is used for the volume of the volume of music files to a standard level . this can be useful for example , to create gem@@ ix@@ es CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize the different recording of the various albums can lead to the in@@ beautiful effect that the music pieces differ according to the same . &quot;
&quot; e@@ Movi@@ es : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start CD and automatically re@@ produce all videos in the basic folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; this is a convenient method , recently opened projects again . the associated sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project . &quot;
&quot; the current project was saved . if the project has already been saved , the file will be over@@ written , otherwise , after a new filename . &quot;
saves the current project under a new filename . KDE &apos;s dialog save is displayed with which you can choose folder and filename for the project file .
saves all open projects . this is the same as if you call for each individual project file Save .
&quot; closes the current project . when a project changes and not saved , asks &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what has to happen . besides , you can then also break between Save and changes . besides , you can also break the closing and keep the project so open . &quot;
&quot; closes all open projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for each non @-@ stored project , what should happen to happen , just as if you had called for each project file . &quot;
&quot; closes all open projects and ends &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for each non @-@ stored project will be asked , what should happen to happen , as if you had called button . &quot;
&quot; if you call this entry , you can add the files straight to the project . this has the same effect as if you start the files straight from the upper view into the project view . if the current project has a data @-@ CD , the files will appear in the basic folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog &quot; &quot; Burn &quot; &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the properties of the project . the only difference is the extra button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burning the medium . burning dialogue can only be opened if the project contains already data . &quot;
opens the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make a lot of project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings ; most of them are described about what is this ? -@@ help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
&quot; this entry only appears with an active data @-@ CD / DVD or Video @-@ DVD project . it is useful when you use files for a multi @-@ session CD . it is useful for you , even if this function is not intended to be used for you , so that you can already see the files already existing files and folder . &quot;
&quot; this entry only appears with an active data @-@ CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function sets out files from the current project . all other files l@@ apse in the project . this function does not remove files from the medium , they bl@@ ends only the previously import@@ ed files again . &quot;
&quot; opens the CD @-@ copying dialog . this also allows the copying of a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can also simply burn a picture of a CD . alternatively , you can also use the possibility of the cl@@ on@@ ens instead of normal copying . you should also prefer to copy CDs with broken sectors or video @-@ CDs . &quot;
&quot; opens the DVD copying dialog . alternatively , you can also create a copy of a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also be able to burn a picture of a DVD with the help of the copying of copying . besides , there is also the possibility of cl@@ adding a DVD using the copying of copying . alternatively , the target medium will be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data from source medi@@ ums in the original form . &quot;
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ R@@ W . this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ R@@ W .
&quot; opens the dialog to the form of a DVD . with this dialog , you can form@@ atting a DVD ± R ( W ) which is completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose the choice between the sp@@ mod@@ i and incre@@ mentally . &quot;
&quot; bur@@ ns a previously released CD @-@ screen . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .c@@ ue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which then immediately may not be burned through g@@ aps of the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * ) r@@ g files are currently not currently supported , so you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; bur@@ ns a previously released DVD @-@ screen . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source , which then can be burned down by pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; a previously set @-@ up DVD video can be converted . this dialog window appears usually after reading a DVD in the ingredi@@ ent , but can also be used also below . it contains information about the exploited video , co@@ al@@ Settings and even opportunities to change the size and to cut black bands . &quot;
&quot; displays information about the occasi@@ onal medium . this information is represented in the content and contain properties of the medium , such as size and titles @-@ length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; displays a list of the work@@ loads from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is covered , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if this is crossed , a small lad@@ der is shown at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not listed , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view is an overview of your folder and the CD / DVD drives . if the content is enabled , their content is displayed in the content displayed . CD / DVD drives will also have a context @-@ menu with features such as media information , sper@@ ren and un@@ lock of the run or throwing the medium . &quot;
&quot; the content @-@ view is a or off . the content @-@ view allows you to choose and drag files into the project view . the content @-@ view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the p@@ industri@@ ous in the project view is one or off . the copying is a narrow scope , which contains only visible when the project view has open projects . the p@@ ational function has no real function , it only looks pretty and separ@@ ating the project view clearly from the remaining views . &quot;
&quot; this will open a dialog window to change the buttons for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after having selected one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adapt the short@@ cut order for it further down . &quot;
&quot; this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; self @-@ Assist@@ ent assist@@ ants . this allows the correct auth@@ orization to burning CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator &apos;s rights are needed , therefore , you must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) . &quot;
&quot; opens up the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here , general functions will be performed . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work on an@@ hi@@ eb . this dialog is intended to custom@@ ize and to the enemy @-@ adjust@@ ing of the program . &quot;
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is how many others &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications are also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface the functionality of functionality can be controlled using a prescribed script .
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; -@@ functions , you can either use the command program d@@ co@@ p , or the something more comfortable program of K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are crucial in the function@@ alities , therefore , is more of your taste and the type of your requirements will be crucial that the programs you den@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter we take that you are using the command program d@@ co@@ p . to make use of the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; -@@ functions , you have to make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then add something like the following on the console : &quot;
&quot; in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; -@@ functions , which have all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Program gem@@ stones , supported &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts that are described below . &quot;
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; presents functions such as copy@@ CD , large DVD and other functions to create new projects . &quot;

as a result of such a creat@@ e@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you can create a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ COP@@ Ref ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ ativ you can get a project about the command via # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project D@@ urch This reference is possible to change the project about K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b offers the listed above K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface which is only applicable on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :

&quot; &amp; com@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is a audio CD ; -@@ Aus@@ les@@ er for &amp; k@@ de ; . with him can be easily stored , and stored in MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible , depending on the en@@ coder on the computer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Re@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading from &amp; CD ; -@@ data in W@@ AV files on the hard disk ) and by many Ko@@ fl@@ ers who are currently being installed ( com@@ pressed com@@ pression ) . further Ko@@ di@@ ers can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) . &quot;
&quot; first , the title of the &amp; CD ; read and stored in W@@ AV files on the computer ( lost @-@ free and com@@ pressed ) ; and then
in a second step these W@@ AV files ( usually one per title ) are com@@ pressed into the MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG format or other formats like the verl@@ ust@@ free FL@@ AC .
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is compiled by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this has not been installed , this has to be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ until ( for O@@ GG ) or other Ko@@ di@@ ers are already available , so it &apos;s probably not necessary for any Linux distri@@ butions you need to be used . if for example FL@@ AC does not need to be used , the installation is also not required . &quot;
which co@@ bs / file format is to be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to Ko@@ di@@ erer , audio quality and com@@ pression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word to copying audio CD ; s : as said , uses &amp; com@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the protection of audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to protect any copying of the audio CD . in any case it can simply avoid the mechanisms of copying audio CD . avoid the purchase of copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while dealing with only once a must be made ( the setup dialog , however , can be accessed as often as a suitable configuration ) , will be explained after daily use of a &amp; CD ; this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the sl@@ ender approach of the user interface , about which you can be visited at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can change in many formats - depending on which codes are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FL@@ AC &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB can get from the internet or can work completely without network , whereby everything is manually captured . &quot;
&quot; this is just a brief list of the commands of the main window . on the side step by step example , you will find further information on how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the regi@@ sters for the configuration of the program . &quot;
&quot; starting the CD@@ DB request the CD@@ DB data , according to the installation of request at the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case the connection has to be made first of connection to the Internet . ) &quot;
start reading and - if a en@@ coder into the tab is configur@@ ed in the setup position - the coding .
&quot; opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available en@@ coder , so that the selection can be read with another en@@ coder as the default factory settings . it is to be configur@@ ed that previously the en@@ coder settings in the setup dialog was configur@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; opens the file manager , so that an already selected file is selected for coded instead of a complete &amp; CD ; add and to ko@@ eln . &quot;
&quot; opens the setup dialog to configure the type of messages ( like proto@@ cols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for programming events ( like reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main communication dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different cart@@ ography ( as en@@ coder , for setting up the En@@ co@@ ders ) . here you need to go before the program can be successfully used ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , co@@ hesive and com@@ presses , and helps you in choosing the right body . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a lost @-@ free audio format is needed . besides FL@@ AC there are also other like &apos; hormones &apos; or &apos; Mon@@ key &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the down@@ sides are able to re@@ produce these files . &quot;
&quot; under the audio formats , losing the information by data com@@ press , are MP3 and O@@ GG the most common . O@@ GG might have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above these bit@@ rate the differences are less important as both co@@ hesive very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; o &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still available with most distri@@ butions available , but there are open license questions &quot;
&quot; + high up to high level quality ( with high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly deeper quality at ti@@ e@@ fer@@ ous bit@@ es . &quot;
&quot; O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer @-@ based music system , and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG devices . &quot;
&quot; MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car @-@ stereo systems . today - initially , these devices are usually only the MP3 format . &quot;
a brief list of parameters for audio quality and out of the com@@ presses for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for other parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer for most people and most of the music pieces , and has already high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi Ster@@ e@@ systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , com@@ pression @-@ rate up to 6.3 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for Hi@@ Fi Ster@@ e@@ systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps CB@@ R , com@@ pression @-@ rate about 5.5 . always needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a boobs . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi Ster@@ e@@ systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos;@@ = 128 k@@ bps CB@@ R common stereo , com@@ pression @-@ rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a boobs . good enough for music of young people , portable devices and auto@@ ster@@ e@@ os systems . however , not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi Ster@@ e@@ systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et Tot@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps CB@@ R . this setting will be exag@@ ger@@ ated for most people and most environments but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information which are manually inserted or obtained through the program automatically from the free@@ DB over the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can be supplied / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the coding programme to create the folder and file names as well as the characteristics of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with coding programs , there are often a combination of programming for the co@@ hesive and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programmes . &quot;
&quot; for example , to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keywords ( English : day ) when MP@@ 3@@ s be coded with l@@ ame , the switch is added by l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; o@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = but@@ ton@@ ing design@@ ation in assist@@ ants ) :
&quot; that is what the free@@ DB is : a free database , in which people download the audio CD you can download , so that all other information can download instead of using myself : &amp; CD ; title , artist , names of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not by the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( an@@ a. of the U@@ eber@@ er ) I am not law@@ yer . however , nobody can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; any more or less valuable , so cannot be added to the artist nor the music @-@ companies . all information can be added any case in a bum@@ bl@@ eb@@ ee through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; o@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is active to choose a cross @-@ field ( Send a address ) . in this type of configuration , it appears , the e @-@ mail address will not be used when retri@@ eve data from the server ( this can only know the programmer who has checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; in many countries , there are copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; for the use of free@@ DB will be used , the geographical position is to be used on the next underlying mirror server . this saves band@@ width in the network and resem@@ bles the burden among the machines . &quot;
a visit to des@@ cen@@ den@@ ces will provide a current list of refl@@ ections for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during the reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database may be downloaded or ( usually monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which output program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save W@@ AV files on my computer ?
there is rum@@ ors that is used to do cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ; who has to know more exactly in source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; see To be noted that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package needs to be installed first if this is not yet done .
&quot; for the stor@@ ing of the W@@ AV files , the Ko@@ di@@ erer can be chosen and thus the desired file format will be chosen . at the first opening , there are a lost com@@ pression for audio data ) on the tab of the stove . other Ko@@ di@@ ers can be added to this tab . &quot;
the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed by the concerned Linux distribution before the Ko@@ di@@ erer can be used . this is also required for the pre @-@ defined co @-@ erer . for more information about Ko@@ di@@ erer are located in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
&quot; after installing a stove , you can get more information about his switches by entering a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a con@@ soles window ( eg ; console ) . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check the furnishings of the device type of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the writing and reading of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , FL@@ AC &amp; etc ; ) . try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal . this could give an indication of what is wrong . &quot;
check if you do not want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; please check out the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , these tips can give you how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , all understood , but are somehow still uns@@ afe what to do is ? well yes , no problem , follow this step @-@ by example , and you will get enough information to set out the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time to start everything and start our first &amp; CD ; we &apos;ll see extreme &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; using MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) of 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; there must be cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution , as it is not completely free software to compile , since it is not necessary to compile the source files , whatever you can do . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you own pen@@ cil on it ( eg ; by trying to copy with the con@@ quer@@ or something ) .
the first section covers the basic obj@@ ection of &amp; com@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; something that is probably only done once and
the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each contrac@@ tual &amp; CD .
&quot; here we determine the enco@@ ding co@@ hesive to com@@ pression of music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) , we split the files to use the free@@ DB to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet . &quot;
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not be able to change it at any time of a &amp; CD , once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device type will be transferred to the read@@ out program to read it the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces can read .
&quot; frequently , / dev / CD@@ ROM is a symbo@@ lic link to the actual device type of your run . if this does not work or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD drive can be specified , so helps a view to the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the available entries of the device names for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
the card @-@ card General settings . here you can &apos;t do much to do . here can be defined an additional conversion . in our example everything will be shown as the screen@@ shot is displayed .
&quot; only If you can ask for full information , so you will be informed when information is missing from the keywords ( tags ) . &quot;
the map card CD ; -@@ settings . simply both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD automatically download via the Internet from a free@@ DB computer .
note : the machine must be connected to the reading of the &amp; CD ; to be connected to the internet so that he can access the free@@ DB server .
&quot; the second selection field is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry is immediately connected with the database entry or tag entries , you can easily be modified with the database entry and the file name , can be easily modified with the database entry and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , dem &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; aside from this example is further to note : if you want to enter everything manually , so de@@ activate the selection areas and free@@ DB will not be utili@@ zed . however , this about 620 MB large , consider this about 620 MB big , consider this about 620 MB large , the two choices must be selected at least the first . the mode is set up on the following box . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is for us free@@ DB . these are settings for data request , for retri@@ eve the &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB server via the Internet . how white the system , which data will receive the CD ? read the section about free@@ DB . put it all as it is in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; mode : we do not download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to the page and look after a mirror server in your area . this way , the load is divided between the machines . however , this setting will work as the first attempt to work . &quot;
&quot; both work equivalent to what the server affects , since but many fire@@ walls of 88@@ 80 does not have luck with the protocol 80 , as the &amp; HTTP ; protocol usually open to surf the internet . &quot;
in this example we do not want to transmit a &amp; CD ; data to the free@@ DB server . the first cross @-@ field should suff@@ ice .
simply take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure that the folder / tmp on your computer )
&quot; number of simultaneously ex@@ changing pieces : sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the same time at just an existing drive ? Parall@@ el@@ es Read and coding ? the author knows it not , therefore simply try . &quot;
CD ; after reading the last piece of piece : crossing this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
&quot; user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you &apos;re using this disk , then the path / folder is specified in which the W@@ AV files will be stored , if only space is stored on a different drive . don &apos;t forget this folder if you want to do something with the W@@ AV files . &quot;
&quot; everything to enter as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is something long , under circum@@ stance a little to the right to see everything to see . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good Hi@@ Fi Ster@@ e@@ os . the resulting bit@@ rate is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the limitation of the generation of tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1st &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; ID@@ 3 &apos; meeting and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
&quot; number of simultaneously to co@@ ar@@ ating W@@ AV files : at a Du@@ al@@ Core or Quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried , more than a W@@ AV file at the same time . &quot;
&quot; this is , we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; finished . this configuration is used as default for any output of a &amp; CD . if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you will never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; this section is described as the process of output of the &amp; CD ; on the hard disk , the folder structure is described and established . first , a connection to the Internet is structured , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the free@@ DB will be described in this section , must be repeated for each contrac@@ tual &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; since we use a &amp; CD , which is not included in free@@ DB , see the screen@@ shots a little different from the data for a &amp; CD ; therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data to manually transfer it from the Internet . comments are shown in the differences . &quot;
do not try the &amp; CD ; this example is to be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this is not yet to happen , now the &amp; CD have to be defined into the drive , which was defined in the main window . &quot;
after a short moment the pieces and its length in the window should be listed as in the screen@@ shot . this only when the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; it could be identified and can be read by cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
&quot; if this does not happen , then you are looking for questions and answers to help or go back to the previous section regarding basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD was completed successfully from the free@@ DB , all titles of the pieces are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album are shown . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; the key for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window appears , and you can choose the database entry that your opinion is best to your &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; if you do not have the cross @-@ field for automatic retri@@ eve of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; -@@ settings in dialog for the settings ) , you can easily rede@@ em this by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you have no local database , but the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - input the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
&quot; type the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos;s title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the artist must no longer be given in the input field &quot; &quot; Current title &apos; , unless you have a combination with various artists for each piece . &quot;
the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ alog@@ y per piece - the comment field of the album will be used for comments which are common for all pieces of the CD .
&quot; attention : after the successful withdrawal of the data from the free@@ DB is not empty , but it has always been a good idea to verify the contents of the CD @-@ Edi@@ tors ( e.g. if all words with large letters begin or not ... ) but also to check if there are any unwanted notes . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this is limited the length of fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the commentary box . if you have ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags ; at least , this option is displayed on the tab code settings ; take a look at the section &apos; fundamental settings &apos; . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information on the generated files later with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot;
&quot; tags will not be supported by all the enco@@ ders or file formats . see in the help of the Ko@@ di@@ erer , to get more information . &quot;
&quot; simply select an entry , which obviously is associated with the style of the in@@ ception CD ; in this example this is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; -@@ data so why not transfer the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap for example is to be found under rock . &quot;
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
&quot; the window of the CD @-@ Edi@@ tors will be back and you will see that the fields marked for the album already recorded with the entered data . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current item . enter the item of the piece in any case and other information you wish . &quot;
click on the next line in the main window and proceed to the same way until you have given all the title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window will not appear if you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB . it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the work@@ load . note that the artist and the album are displayed about the piece list .
&quot; note that there are a check @-@ sign in front of each row of a piece . only the titles which are highlighted . a simple click on the line you are selected . a simple click on the line , select the piece of the piece , or select the button All pieces choose at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at one time . &quot;
&quot; was started by clicking on the button selection , then this window appears to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on . &quot;
click on the rider orders for switching on the order window . it is located in the left top half of the window directly under the buttons of the factory .
this is the window for controlling the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard@@ disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left section of the window in the status line .
&quot; you can see this error , if you are trying to work with a co@@ er@@ erer that you have not been installed . pieces that have not been successful with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list . &quot;
&quot; by the way , the folder for the tmp @-@ file and the target folder are not what we have given here in example . have you checked whether you have access to the folder for the temporary files and the target folder ? ; - ) &quot;
&quot; now it is clear , why the error occurred directly after the end of the first piece of the piece . &quot;
&quot; the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 into the format MP3 . therefore , check the status quo in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has not found configur@@ ations to sign this behavior . the only one thing to configure , is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding . in high @-@ weak machines the result is un@@ clear . the used machine using a AM@@ D@@ 64 does not seem to have any problem with simultaneous reading and coding ( of however two different pieces ) . &quot;
&quot; now the last title is read , while another piece is coded , and a third order is coded in the queue of the stove , a small window will be built with a message for a short time in the top left of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you require &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x. or 4.@@ x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create com@@ pressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the co@@ hesive of your choice . &quot;
&quot; it is today maintained within the &amp; k@@ de ; CV@@ S as part of the k@@ dem@@ on package . however , if you are already included with CV@@ S . most distri@@ butions already contain a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package . if you read this , you have probably already done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is directed to persons , compiled by source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for assistance like the program can be adapted to your needs when it runs once , then the following is correct for you : &quot;
&quot; a program called for many different other programs , has many variants of settings . best read the step by step example to learn the options and settings . it offers screen photos of the different box cards of settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; hello , still at the reading ? even if only the help menu was attached to the first starting point of the program , without any cl@@ ue as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially when it is at the time of the program starts no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from unusual short menu ? &quot;
&quot; what is it ? who reads this , probably already started the program . it should be somehow like that : &quot;
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as a first version for a manual for a manual for &amp; com@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; but who will always do something useful to change or change it . at least after the contact with the author . and if you read this , he has got this section and therefore is agreed with this proposal . &quot;
&quot; strange if it has succeeded in getting the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need this information , but ... &quot;
&amp; K@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; k@@ de ; . besides others he does not have a real @-@ time @-@ time @-@ real @-@ real @-@ real @-@ time collection of texts also some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI player does not have .
&quot; run under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it is based on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ de ; support also function . &amp; k@@ mid ; supports also the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ aso@@ und @-@ proj@@ ectors , which is used for CIS @-@ cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as there is a sequence . &quot;
&quot; k@@ mid ; shows the lyrics on the screen with altern@@ ating color , so it is easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of any MIDI channel through a flo@@ o@@ graph of the penet@@ rated buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
Dra@@ g &amp; Drop so that you can walk in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to KM@@ id .
supported the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( Lie@@ uten@@ ations or path@@ ological events ) . KM@@ id fixed automatically the procedure used .
&quot; seating suppor@@ ter . if you end &amp; k@@ de ; during the play@@ back of a song , KM@@ id starts again with the same song again . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , A@@ we , FM and CIS cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can select Open ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog with whose help you can select the desired song . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window to the &amp; k@@ mid ; this also works with several songs at the same time .
&quot; to add a piece of music , open it and wor@@ ding the kno@@ b kno@@ b in the tool@@ bar , select the entry subscription out of the menu pieces and be@@ ep the Spac@@ eb@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece automatically starts , as soon as you pull it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . ( with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then re@@ played in each other . ) &quot;
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece set off , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the regul@@ ator and driving . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song becomes too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows to turn left and right of the Tem@@ plate and so the play@@ back speed change . to restore the original speed , click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the Spac@@ eb@@ ar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the blan@@ ket like a pressure on the button break or selecting the menu entry into the menu item , so breaks the play@@ site during no piece starts , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; the play@@ back . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ ed@@ tex@@ te can be stored on two species in a piece of music . some pieces use tex@@ ter@@ event , others use Li@@ ed@@ tex@@ ter@@ able and again other both . some pieces have no text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can adjust what events are to be represented , and even better : the event type is selected automatically that you have to set up a song , so you will have nothing to manually set up in the menu settings . however , you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set out a event , select from the menu settings the entries of the entries or songs of songs . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you summar@@ ize . these will be played in line . in this section , how you can use collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to open a collection , you first open the collecting manager . this can be found in the menu collection under the point of organizing .... Click New and give the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can adjust the f@@ ake in the coll@@ ector manager . &quot;
the temporary collection reach all the songs that you want to add to any other collection .
&quot; when using the application , this collection will not be saved . concerns that if you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the coll@@ ector manager . there you can add a song with the button adding a song . it appears in turn the file dialog with whose help you can select the desired song . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on the setting of automatic transmission to the collection .
&quot; when automatic execution is enabled , a piece of opening ( using file Op@@ ens or drag &amp; drop ) automatically added to active collection . &quot;
&quot; when automatic add to the collection is not activated , the temporary collection is activated and pun@@ ches . this collection will then be added to the remaining pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection managers , select the collection and the desired song and then click distance . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order to be played in which the songs will be played . if you choose the row after the sub@@ menu drop off the menu collections , the songs are played in order , as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add songs or remove or random order in the menu , the order will be new . &quot;
&quot; to send a song , select it in the coll@@ ector manager , or use the selection list via the kar@@ aoke text . &quot;
&quot; to jump a song , select the button next song , the entry next song from the menu pieces or press the button arrow right . &quot;
&quot; to jump the way back a song , select the button @-@ previous piece , the entry previous piece of the menu pieces or press the button arrow to the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection managers , select the collection and click on the button Clear . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection can not be clear@@ ed . however , this doesn &apos;t matter as it is not saved by leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not stored . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesizer , which are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case the MIDI @-@ map General @-@ MIDI @-@ events in events that understands the syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map showing all events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the type Change Patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et and thus continues to sound a trumpet , if originally a piano . &quot;
&quot; if you have only a sound card , you do not need MIDI map because all Sound@@ cards GM -@@ compatible are ( incl. A@@ we - and CIS @-@ cards , FM @-@ devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI @-@ maps . so you must edit the corresponding file from hand ( with your favorite se@@ ater ) . &quot;
a MIDI @-@ map is a text file that saves all necessary re@@ plac@@ ements for the re@@ play of a piece .
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which may appear so often as desired . pre@@ condition for this , however , that every appearance has a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
&quot; Def@@ ine PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ ANN@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D options ... EN@@ D &quot;
see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section begins ( except options ) and EN@@ D that the end of a paragraph .
&quot; please send me your map file as email , so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be used for devices that are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible . &quot;
in this section the patches of General MIDI will be shown on your specific keyboard . the general use looks as follows :
&quot; please note that the left side of the equ@@ ality is ignored . it is assumed that the GM -@@ patches in the right order exist ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and also no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is needed to put all t@@ ints , which this instrument need to put on the tone with number M ( e.g. with Ton 60 ) , which allows you to take a Drum ( e.g. with Ton 60 ) , which allows you to take the following in the PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section : &quot;
&quot; so if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 ( thread@@ ed ) , it takes patch 100 ( the Drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of what sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here with the term &quot; Drum Patch patch &quot; , &quot; with which every tone is a different per@@ cus@@ sion@@ stru@@ ment ( Drum , bas@@ ins , Marac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one , where the tone the clay height of the same d@@ rum means ( as it possess some key@@ boards ) . &quot;
KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is needed to specify how t@@ ints are shown on a particular channel or instrument .
&quot; as with PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the order of lines is very important , as well as their presence . you must therefore create 128 entries . &quot;
you can use multiple key@@ maps for each channel and every instrument . you only have to use different names in the first row .
key@@ maps are used especially for t@@ ints on the per@@ cus@@ sions channel . look in as an example the supplied key@@ maps .
&quot; this section can be used to map some channels to others . if you want to exchange the first and second channel , make it easily in the CH@@ ANN@@ EL@@ MA@@ P . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have Per@@ cussion to have a specific channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; Midi @-@ devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ ANN@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section therefore has 16 lines , number@@ ed from 0 to 15 , built after the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; n is the channel , which is needed on the channel N . if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map is needed for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored the patch on this channel . in this case it will always be Patch x used . &quot;
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for instance to always use the per@@ cus@@ sions patch on the per@@ cus@@ sions .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio is available , in which relation pit@@ ch @-@ ben@@ der events multip@@ lies . if a MIDI file sends a pitch using the value n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only passed . the value 40@@ 96 is not calculated so that in the map file will not be dec@@ im@@ al@@ com@@ ma ) . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM gives you a keyboard , which is a pitch for playing 40@@ 96 to play a sound higher . unfortunately , however , some Key@@ boards will try to play a bit higher in order to get the right value on your keyboard , you need to sample a bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the dialog MIDI settings . these can be found in the menu under settings , point MIDI settings &quot;
the Kan@@ al@@ view is a window with a whole row pi@@ anos ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on this pi@@ anos you can see which sounds are just played .
&quot; you can also use the can@@ al@@ view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can choose an instrument , the button is no longer green , but red to indicate that no longer is used the original instrument . &quot;
&quot; the can@@ al@@ view has ( up to now ) two different views , to view the players . view in the menu settings below the point channel view : settings &quot;
&quot; the pace @-@ LCD shows the speed , with which a song is ab@@ used . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the pace of a song . if you like e.g. , a song is too fast to follow the text you can slow down . to change the speed , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece has to be played . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , &amp; etc . . this can lead the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results , just like two different musicians play the same music in a very different way . &quot;
&quot; well , I can force anyone to force , &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs approximately 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file 4 MB needs a similar sound quality . in a MIDI file , you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; that may happen if you have a bin@@ ary distribution ( rpm ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; have happened , because &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ we support was compiled . to download the problem , you need to download a source code and install ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos; s ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files on individually . &quot;
&quot; agreed to support &amp; k@@ mid ; Dra@@ g &amp; Drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . &quot;
dis@@ able to enable the setting of automatic adding to the collection . otherwise the files are added to the temporary collection .
you can use the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD scre@@ ening to slow the play@@ back . to restore the default temp@@ o you can click on the LCD double .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ working surface a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Windows with my MIDI files and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I want to play a MIDI file game ) or I &apos;d like to play a file ; only to switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; switch to the window and the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ;
&quot; if you want to listen to a file if you want to add a file without adding to a collection , turn off the setting of automatic adding to the collection , and the new ; file is added to temporary collection added . &quot;
&quot; we take you , you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first , you just want to play the first file . so you just want to add the first file to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly these a MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; then include yourself , also B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid down@@ stream and a collection with all three files to create . how do you make this ? &quot;
these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . all thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard animated me this to continue to &amp; k@@ mid ;

&quot; sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , since the sound quality is essentially dependent on your sound card . it is not the same as if you use a FM device or a A@@ we map . &quot;
&quot; if you have no sound card , you have to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can &apos;t hear music . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mail@@ ing@@ lists or send a message directly to me . &quot;
&quot; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ ono and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files from M@@ Player or PH@@ ON@@ ON supported formats , as well as to play DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished than &amp; k@@ de ; on this computer was installed .
&quot; for additional help please check the page The KDE Web site to new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Mail@@ ing list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is formed from so called and@@ ock@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . alternatively , there is a window with the playlist . and finally there is a information window that will only appear to be displayed in it . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to send the favorite links below the menu book@@ marking , but this is individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that can be played after each other so you should use the category thumb . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hier@@ archy . if you have an entry anc@@ akes , his group and all his sub@@ groups to the current category will be copied and play@@ back starts with the requested entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; up piece &apos; , television and durability can also be changed through direct editing of the XML configuration files . naturally , the different files in the directory ~ / .k@@ de / share / apps / km@@ player / , can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself . simply click on a name of a category . by selecting a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this section is displayed . &quot;
&quot; after ch@@ asing of XML files , must be selected from the menu the same with playlist and either the mach@@ ining mode , or another category selected . &quot;
all changes will be lost when the mach@@ ining mode or another group is selected without having the playlist .
&quot; owing to the convenience of the author of &amp; km@@ player ; some functions can only be swit@@ ched through changing the XML configuration files .. &quot;
the animation during Star@@ ts and Be@@ ating can be disabled by the edi@@ tions of ~ / .k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c and Change by &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted . &quot;
it is also possible to enable another animation . &amp; km@@ player ; the files ~ / .k@@ de / share / apps / km@@ player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .k@@ de / share / apps / km@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be an supported XML file .
&quot; the animation during the starting needs will not be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening a different source . this would be anno@@ yed at the end @-@ animation , the user can therefore end the application a second time . &quot;
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the ads of a Favor@@ ling@@ sf@@ ot@@ os : &amp; lt ; ref@@ unds ; &amp; lt ; img _ ; &amp; lt ; _ n@@ ail@@ .jpg ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ work ; &amp; lt ; / rock@@ ing ; In the source tests / a few examples of S@@ MI@@ L are supported by &amp; km@@ player ;
&quot; there is a rider for the configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; km@@ player ; . here , the path of the M@@ Player and the sub @-@ memory size of the file can be adjusted from the network and other things . &quot;
another tool for error message is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of km@@ player . here is the output of m@@ player visible .
&quot; there is no rider for this ren@@ dition in the configur@@ ing dialog of &amp; km@@ player ; . everything must be configur@@ ed by manual , the file ~ / .k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa will be played : &quot;
&apos;@@ Flash &apos;@@ can be played within &amp; km@@ player ; it can even be played the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
&quot; so that the &amp; km@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages can be re @-@ giving , the &amp; km@@ player ; module as service provider for the M@@ IME type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the setup @-@ dialog file to be specified by KDE . &quot;
the con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; km@@ player ; can be launch in a con@@ soles application and search for radio on the loading of the browser module library . the stri@@ pped process is kn@@ p@@ player . if here no error occur is the back@@ end issue within &amp; km@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu to consider ) . &quot;
&quot; thus , a given back@@ end for a particular m@@ ime is taken ( of course only if this was also determined ) , this must be done by manual change the file ~ / .k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example is PH@@ ON@@ ON all og@@ g files again : &quot;
&quot; multi@@ player ; can be downloaded from TV cards , either via M@@ Player or X@@ video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be configur@@ ed , the scanner can be configur@@ ed from the configuration dialog , or the configur@@ ations file can be manually put manually . &quot;
&quot; to configure the V@@ DR ( Video data record ) settings in the settings below - &gt; Qu@@ antum &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ video port ( e.g. , PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name has probably included a DV@@ B . &quot;
since the V@@ DR &apos;s support can be used only X@@ video ( pres@@ um@@ ably this type of play@@ back of video equipment on Linux is the only one which works ) . this is also only working on the first screen ( : 0.0 ) . this is also valid for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server ( / etc / X@@ 11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) : this is why the V@@ Free@@ 86 server must therefore be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
&quot; internally are used by KM@@ Player for the sources of different names . at the time of the emergence of this documentation , this dv@@ dn@@ av@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , source @-@ source , tv@@ source , tv@@ source , gener@@ ation@@ source , v@@ cd@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . when they are activated , they begin with the play@@ back of the playlist . &quot;
is there any indication of how I can get my CD@@ ROM drive when I play from him ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command hd@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / CD@@ ROM is defined as a user root after entering the device . it is absolutely sure to put the / dev / CD@@ ROM to the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
&quot; X@@ ine only starts slowly , why has to be checked my CPU on their performance every time ? &quot;
&quot; note : the answer is over@@ taking . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time is x@@ ine the CPU . &quot;

&quot; all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; add the sub@@ division of the document into the following items ( part is the highest element ) , &quot;
&quot; in view of the document displayed in the structural view , the single elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click on the respective side . &quot;
when you create your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ files can be very helpful as soon as a DVI . -@@ file ( engl . d e V ice I n@@ dependent File ) &#93; was created to jum@@ ps &amp; k@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ View on the corresponding line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code .
a DVI . -@@ file contains a description of the format document and also other information like the font and is adjacent to PDF . there are many tools to view ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools to view and print files ; -@@ files for different systems and scent .
&quot; when using the back , the elements of the DVI ; -@@ file with the editor is shor@@ ten@@ ed , and once upon an element in the DVI . -@@ source code was sent , becomes the corresponding section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code was sent , becomes the corresponding place in the DVI . -@@ viewers . &quot;
Master @-@ Document : this function is simpli@@ fied in working with multiple files . with a Master document the work is simpli@@ fied with other .@@ tex files . when using a project a project @-@ wide master document can be adjusted to project settings .
&quot; quick , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if no error in the source code ) . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , the DVI . in this mode , the DVI . -@@ file is made on as@@ ma@@ der@@ â s ) , and there is no call by &amp; Ok@@ ep@@ iece ; according to the quick@@ set . &quot;
&quot; in the viewing of the editing process , the three cru@@ de selection fields are running for the fast installation of common elements into the document . the first selection range is for the fast installation of the document in parts , chapter , sections , ... The base of the sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; the selection range is for entry of articles such as the keywords , Fu@@ el@@ ih@@ lav@@ ish or refer@@ r@@ als . &quot;
name : with this command a name is created for a section to create a picture or a different element .
reference : is used for reference to a fixed term ( selection of a selection ) .
&quot; when using the quot@@ ation , a selection list will be displayed with liter@@ ary inser@@ ts . for these files are appropriate editors necessary . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bib@@ tex ; and &amp; bi@@ bi@@ b ; the &amp; bib@@ tex ; -@@ files can also be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand . &quot;
&quot; the last selection with the name of Gr@@ Ã ¶ e , will be used for the definition of the scrip@@ tures , for the main text , the fleet operators , etc . there are the following fon@@ ts : &quot;
&quot; at the call of &amp; k@@ ile ; two choices on display : 1 . the assistant for the creation of a new document by selecting the document type and custom@@ ised the settings . 2 . the document can be written from scratch with the hand . &quot;
&quot; the cl@@ amps after the command \ \ Docum@@ enta include the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; lays the scri@@ bed , not at the beginning , it can also happen in the text . &quot;
&quot; once the above source code has been introduced , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code has to be compiled . the simpl@@ est way to this is the use of men@@ dation , or of the Kn@@ op@@ fs quick design . &quot;
&quot; the source code must be stored before the compile . &amp; k@@ ile ; for storage , the storage is automatically removed . &quot;
&quot; the compil@@ ing of the document command should be sought in the proto@@ cols for errors . when use of quick@@ set , &amp; ey@@ ep@@ iece should be started . if this is not the case , should also be considered the proto@@ cols . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( English . environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the text is created , for example , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } , is the reduction of the log@@ otype in the area . &quot;
the goods are only permitted in the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ &apos; { environment } ) advis@@ able . there is no complaint ( number ) for the reduction in a environment .
&quot; there are many features to enlight@@ en the legi@@ bility and user @-@ friendliness of the document . it can be added for example , certain fon@@ ts , fat @-@ pressure , sin@@ ks , etc . these commands may be added either by command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the area . &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the cur@@ siv@@ ity and is long as long as it is closed until he is closed by a \ \ &apos; end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a set can be displayed with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ rating : created a quote in the document . the quot@@ ation starts with \ \ begin { rate } and ends with \ \ &apos; { rates } .
&quot; after the background to the writing of the source with the &amp; lat@@ ex , a step @-@ step guide is now follows a step @-@ step guide for the creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; &quot;
&quot; once in the assist@@ ants a bit of text was given , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be served . here , min@@ d. ought to be a quote , a few places in obesity and cur@@ siv@@ ity and a poem to the application to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , can be sent via editor @-@ View or Str@@ g E back to the editor ( with the internal spect@@ ator ) . with an external viewer , the window must be closed . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI , file has been created , the document can be converted or into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun . &quot;
&quot; DVI . ( e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the legi@@ bility of some drivers of the computer , there are many different types of the .d@@ vi -@@ edition such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ transform@@ ers or computer @-@ screen . &quot;
&quot; for the print of a &amp; DVI . -@@ file , the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . on the 7th step - after the Click on DVI , then the document can be printed using the print ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is correct ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar allows the conversion of the DVI . -@@ file into other formats . once the DVI , file from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code was created , the conversion can begin by the buttons in the factory . &quot;
the Next search results in the direct jump from the editor to the related position inside the DVI . -@@ Datei .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ bin@@ ary files . therefore only Modern under settings are set up ... tools B@@ auen .
&quot; in order to set up the record , the mouse has to be positioned in a line of source . the le@@ ap in the DVI . the jump is done in the DVI . &quot;
with this function in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document of &amp; k@@ ile ; p@@ added and for the corresponding line . this must be specified in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; as Tex@@ te@@ di@@ tor ( settings ey@@ ep@@ iece )
&quot; should the use of quick@@ set of &amp; DVI ; -@@ viewers will not lie , there can be a mistake . should be a mistake , this will be displayed in the proto@@ cols file or in the news window . &quot;
&quot; the proto@@ cols file beh@@ aves the error source in the source code . in the editor there is always the line , in which the error appears . to view the faul@@ ty row , must be cli@@ cked on the faul@@ ty row and &amp; k@@ ile ; jump to the faul@@ ty line . &quot;
&quot; once upon the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to choose a selection of the template for the document . &quot;
&quot; when selecting a smaller document , a document can be written either from scratch or the assistant for the fast creation of a new document . for more information this section are included in the section . &quot;
&quot; users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either create an existing &amp; tex ; - / Lat@@ ex ; -@@ file size or a new file will be created . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template using any existing document and selection of a template used by a template . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template using file , some string @-@ chains are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or text enco@@ ding ) . these variables can set up in settings k@@ ile ... settings can be set . &quot;
when creating your own template it is therefore necessary to know which strings of which variables are replaced :
$ $ DO@@ WN ENT@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string is replaced by entering the document class . typically they are used as follows : \ \ Docum@@ ent@@ ENT@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { article } .
the easi@@ est way to create a template is the use of assist@@ ants and that of the commands of the commands in the editor . as soon as the document has been created in this way :
&quot; when creating a new document , the custom template instead of the standard will be selected . &quot;
a template can be created from any other &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ files created . will be a simple way to create a template used should be looked after one on the internet and the steps described below .

&quot; to learn more &amp; ties ; and its features should be experienced the manual for Kate , users of &amp; k@@ ile ; we can go there directly to the reading of the chapter with the editor of &amp; k@@ ates ; &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference , which can be called for the help La@@ Te@@ X reference . you will find a comprehensive description of virtually all commands , which can be used in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use as well as their syntax . &quot;

when using the arrow buttons with insul@@ ated rot@@ ary taste can be selected parts of the source tex@@ tured in the Edi@@ tor@@ window .
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; has the features to browse the most different kinds of source tex@@ tures and emphas@@ ise these factors . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands from normal text and also the mathemati@@ cal form@@ ul@@ as are highlighted by another color . &quot;
&quot; many assist@@ ants can have an own kind of book@@ marks in the text . this is an own type of book@@ marks , or the corresponding key@@ boards , so that it is also highlighted the jump to the most common or last jumping brand , so that they will automatically convert them automatically with the first input of a drawing . &quot;
&quot; the Bear@@ ings is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; k@@ ile ; even though &amp; k@@ ates ; already outstanding features have been added to the writing of a &amp; lat@@ ex ; special orders for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; special commands , the following commands are included in the following commands : &quot;
&quot; select a complete paragraph ( group of lines , which are meant on both sides a blan@@ k lines ) . with a paragraph there is not a text with a g@@ limp@@ se lines . these advanced importance are as@@ certain@@ ed with that tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of the source . the only bow thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; therefore , is that the plates are separated by two blan@@ k lines . &quot;
&quot; select the word under the current cur@@ sor . this selection also has an advanced significance , as this command also has a lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a given rise ( \ \ ) and a higher star ( * ) at the end . &quot;
&quot; for being part of a part of the document , the keyboard C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the whole line is removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers with its own command@@ ment , the following commands may contain the following commands : &quot;
remo@@ ves a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is included in the description of machin@@ ed paragraph .
&quot; it has already been clear@@ ed that environments has a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; that is why it offers &amp; k@@ ile ; for further orders among Bear@@ ings , ideal work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; &quot;
&quot; with this command , the beginning of the current environment is sung , no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to the heart of the environment . &quot;
&quot; with this command , the end of the current environment is sung , no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to the cake . &quot;
if the cur@@ sor before or within the command \ \ begin { surroundings } is located at the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering a lot of wel@@ ded ambi@@ ent commands can quickly be lost . this command le@@ athers not the most recently proven ambi@@ ent structure .
&quot; also offers special orders for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ groups , which are determined by brack@@ ets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands , those made of Bear@@ ings . &quot;
with this command the start of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the frac@@ tory cl@@ amps .
&quot; with this command , at the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the sof@@ ten@@ ded cl@@ amps . &quot;
if the cur@@ sor before or behind the cur@@ ated cl@@ amps of a &amp; tex ; -@@ Gruppe # is on the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many wel@@ ded groups @-@ stap@@ les can quickly be lost . this command le@@ athers the last group so that the wel@@ ded structure of the &amp; tex ; -@@ groups not exp@@ elled .
&quot; in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple quotes are used as a gri@@ pping point . for example , the sign of treatment is used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign &quot; &quot; for two simple quotes are used . &quot;
this automatic inser@@ ts of double cases can set up under settings k@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X set up and reti@@ red .
&quot; it can also be used in specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or french ) , and therefore German or fran@@ c@@ Ã ¼ nett@@ les . there are also many other languages available . &quot;
&quot; if the current position within a lists of Shi@@ ft ; dispos@@ ed , a smart periods of time ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or item@@ ize ) , for example the current position within a lists of surroundings ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or item@@ ize ) , but at the same time the command \ \ item . &quot;
&quot; within a tables of the area , the current line with \ \ \ \ \ with an arbit@@ r@@ ary period of time . &quot;
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to under@@ scor@@ ed pre @-@ established &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments .
&quot; some users know the columns in tables -@@ environments , and all the E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) with each other . &amp; k@@ ile ; is trying to achieve this . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; k@@ ate ; already has a good source code ter@@ mination , it was installed in &amp; k@@ ile ; in order to make special orders ( most for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) are still extended , and the other two are for automatic exp@@ ires . all these modes can set up the automatic locking &quot; &quot; all these modes . &quot;
at the beginning a new environment by using the command \ \ begin { surroundings } will go &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ &apos; end { surroundings } according to an empty line ( for the text ) .
&quot; when using the back taste , the final letter of the input will be removed , and therefore the complete list of the input list may be removed . on the other hand , the list can also result by entering a further letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are being removed from a command of a command . alternatively you can have a jump to these positions using the spring@@ ing spring@@ board N@@ Ã ¤ h@@ est spring@@ board . &quot;
&quot; among settings k@@ ile ; to set up ... k@@ ile ; exp@@ ired settings to these lists are made . it can be considered different wine lists for these lists ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands , as well as moder@@ ation of the general language used . &quot;
&quot; the command mode is for the exp@@ ires of environments . it will always be given a few letters with \ \ begin and the call for full @-@ time mode , the environments will often be used , that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for setting up the environments . &quot;
&quot; when calling the full @-@ speed mode , the setting of the setting is automatically consolidated and it appears \ \ begin { . afterwards , the ambi@@ tions will continue in the easi@@ est way and thus can be completed by pressing the input . &quot;
&quot; after this is accomplished , the environment is automatically closed once again . once &amp; k@@ ile ; realis@@ es that it is a lists of a lists , is even a first \ \ item command . &quot;
&quot; among settings k@@ ile ; setup the settings to these lists are made . this mode uses the full @-@ speed mode for the full @-@ speed mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands . &quot;
&amp; K@@ ile ; under@@ laid user @-@ defined lists of distr@@ actions that will be replaced immediately by using settings . the lists can be included under settings k@@ ile . kill the file examp@@ le@@ .c@@ w@@ l in which example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
&quot; for example , the letter L is given and the word re@@ conc@@ iled speed , the letter L replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is replaced . &quot;
&quot; Gro@@ Ã ¡ MED@@ IA W@@ Ã ¼ nett@@ le are not helpful , however , that many walls have been written in a document more than once . &quot;
&quot; this mode can set up in the menu &apos;s settings ... K@@ ile Ver@@ sion@@ ing ab@@ sent . here , the sw@@ elling can also be specified for the display of the complete ownership . &quot;
the full @-@ time files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ ile / jack@@ eted Home folder ) or tex .
&quot; the dialogue is designed to include graphics as easy as possible . to view the basics of the graphics to the graphic formats , the sections should be absor@@ bed and notice . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as well known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for loc@@ alization and new regulations of pages . will the PDF version can be arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; -@@ tools are designed and then be converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; to get the result of work thoroughly , the source code must be compiled . all parts tools are group@@ ed in the men@@ tioning creation , creating change and create view . &quot;
for the compens@@ ate of the source for viewers like &amp; ey@@ ep@@ iece ; or the further conversion can be used by the keyboard ; it can be used by using Alt ; 4 the DVI ; -@@ file into a PS file and be viewed by old ; 5 the PS file .
&quot; when using the command processor , normally a viewer is called after the compile and should not be used in an integrated viewer , every time will be a new window . &quot;
&quot; a new project will get the project a new project .... here , the following information for the project is asked : &quot;
&quot; when selecting the filename window , the relative path must be specified by the .k@@ ilep@@ r project file . &quot;
the script function of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows the drilling from EC@@ MA@@ Script -@@ Ko@@ de . the scripts have to be managed in the sen@@ est body .
the API @-@ scripts have not yet been developed and can be used in other versions of &amp; k@@ ile ; still intact .
&quot; first , it must be said that the exp@@ o @-@ environment of the scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a system @-@ wide object ( = k@@ ile ) with the following methods : &quot;
&quot; lat@@ ex ; is a quite distinctive system , in which the basic functions are extended by a variety of different packages . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a lot of different assistance to under@@ line the user . &quot;
&quot; &amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are delivered with many documents . in this include a documentation for the included packages , and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference . &quot;
&quot; this is not only a description of all the programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather it is a complete manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands , and is therefore ideal for a specific type of packages . as it is a very rough document , it is divided into &amp; com@@ ile ; in three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents with those of the ex ; / tex@@ live ; shipped , the fin@@ des of the right document is not always easy . the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k offers a database with all to &amp; k@@ ile ; the supplied documents and below a graphic Ober@@ thal . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the advantage is the search for par@@ cel name or stroke . by &amp; k@@ ile ; then only the results are displayed .
a double @-@ click with the mouse or the actu@@ ation of the Spac@@ eb@@ ar the viewer for the document .

the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nickname is the nickname and serves to clear identification .
one member can have several roles in the project such as a team@@ leader as well as sub@@ project leader .
the user can look out for themselves from the list of team@@ work who he is . this happens by pressing the team member from the list and putting the button as supp@@ er . the currently selected Member ( its identification ) appears f@@ ett after you are : text .
&quot; top names and the attitude of its own identity are important in terms of messages and comments , see for further information about comments . &quot;
&quot; in addition to an overview of her team there is another advantage by the capture of the members of the team : it can be created an event for information to the team leaders , when something happens . see in for further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that will be executed when something particular happens in the project . an example would be seen how much someone worked in it , or a script , if a file is saved , or a script that will be added to the CV@@ S , as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; on the page of the Shi@@ ft ; F@@ 7 project project settings , events can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
&quot; an email will be sent to the addres@@ see list selected ad@@ ress@@ ings . the Ad@@ res@@ sat may be a team@@ - or sub@@ project leader . see in , wei such head will be established . &quot;
remarks are special comments in the documents . you are different from normal comments by the following things :
note to enter is simple . it may either be chosen the note -@@ entry from the editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a commentary range followed by noti@@ fied text .
comments can be sent to a determin@@ able member of the team . in this case is the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( roll ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( roll ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( roll ) or sub@@ project lad@@ ders should be stated in the respective departments or sub@@ project profiles .

&quot; here the Par@@ ser and the structur@@ ing tree , which represents the figure of the Par@@ ser @-@ kn@@ ots in the document , can be adjusted in details . &quot;
&quot; in the area of mouse @-@ clicking on the structural tree , the following action is possible to change the following structure by clicking the structural tree with the Mou@@ sep@@ ads . &quot;
&quot; in the range of structural adjustment , the visibility of kn@@ ots in the tree can be opened automatically . blan@@ k kn@@ ots are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are such , where the current document has not been found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; the area to determine the abbre@@ vi@@ ations ( a kind of templates ) , which are un@@ divided in groups , each can be divided into groups , each may be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s , it can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it can be valid for Jav@@ as@@ cript something else than in a group is valid for Jav@@ as@@ cript . &quot;
&quot; here , the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plugins are part @-@ applications of third @-@ hand applications , which can be re@@ used by each K@@ Part @-@ capable application , the most known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . when adding a plug @-@ in , the following is to be specified : &quot;
address : the path to the plugin if it is not in a standard location like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
&quot; input : this information will be given to the plugin for the start , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; can load the component in &quot; Just @-@ L@@ ese &quot; mode : check if the plugin refuse the loading . only @-@ L@@ ese k@@ Parts usually refuse to load the store if this option is not selected . &quot;
&quot; check out the plugin : is this activated , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; whether the dis@@ appears information is correct . select the memory of the entry is not available , but if the plugin for the moment is not available , but it will be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; from version 3.3 , the bug@@ fixes was completely new . the support for the non @-@ built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger was shut down , as well as the support for the db@@ g Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead of which a de@@ bug@@ ger Plugin concept was implemented , which enables various implem@@ entations to plug @-@ ins . &quot;
&quot; currently , only one plugin available , support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; sub@@ folders ; add . &quot;
the use of the de@@ bug@@ ger for a project begins with the selection of suitable de@@ bug@@ ger plug @-@ ins in the project settings . with the button options next to the de@@ bug@@ ger Plugin selection tool can change the specific settings .
if a de@@ bug@@ ger is enabled for a project to appear some additional items in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; user interface :
a view that is displayed in which the contents of covered variables is displayed . usually appears in the left do@@ ck .
&quot; a view , in which all the points are listed , with periods and conditions listed . appears normally in the lower Dock . &quot;
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bug@@ ger is usually shown in the lower Dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bug@@ ger is all or part of the following functionality available .
&quot; with this action the connection to the de@@ bug@@ ger , if required , or she shares the plugin with , on de@@ duc@@ tible standards . this action is opened by default when a project is opened that a de@@ bug@@ ger will not be respected on it . &quot;
the counter@@ part of de@@ bug@@ ging session starts the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bug@@ ger or ends the leaf to meet .
send a HTTP request to the server to send a de@@ bug requirement . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to watch the current document . the issue of this requirement is displayed in view Deb@@ ug@@ ger issue .
&quot; indicates the de@@ bug@@ ger , start with the execution of the script and to date information on the un@@ guard@@ ed variables , as well as the current specified line is ongoing , the execution continues during the script , the execution is continued before a de@@ bug strain , the script starts with the requirement . &quot;
&quot; to send the de@@ bug@@ ger to send out the execution of the script , without information to over@@ w@@ ed variables and the current time number , the execution is continuing . if this happens before a de@@ duc@@ ed call starts , the execution starts as soon as a request . &quot;
the de@@ bug@@ ger leads the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or includes .
the de@@ bug@@ ger leads the next instruction in the script that if possible in functions and includes included in error .
indicates the de@@ bug@@ ger to move the instruction and go to the next to go as if there were the current not .
&quot; opens a dialog , where a variable or an expression can be entered , which is to be monitored . the exceed value appears in the variable view . &quot;
&quot; with this dialog , a variable entry can be inserted or a new value of a variable . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work of Kei@@ th Is@@ dale , as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a &amp; cold ; front @-@ end and a part of x@@ sl@@ db@@ g , which they can find on http : / / x@@ sl@@ db@@ g.@@ sf@@ .net with many other works of Kei@@ th . &quot;
this chapter describes how to adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ca ; to adapt to your needs and how to help &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; help better to become better .
&quot; document@@ type Edi@@ ting packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ antum department , to give support for Mark@@ up@@ - and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; to give . your simplicity and flexibility makes a quick , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web@@ hosting , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ ings languages and family 2 , the script languages and &amp; CSS ; s &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are made of two parts , the tag folder and the tool@@ bar ( above the Edi@@ te window ) , which can insert the text and instructions faster into a document than a user ever could . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ T@@ D . see for details on conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to create , then the &amp; aid p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also work@@ loads . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot;
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes of tags as well as the layout and the contents of the self @-@ gene@@ alog@@ y ; it contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; itself . work@@ loads enable a quick use of tags in a document without a danger of writing .
&quot; day Fol@@ der are nothing but a folder . you only contain the &amp; ast@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the equ@@ XML files . day @-@ folder carry the names of the descri@@ b@@ able language and version , so there . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ ph ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of the equ@@ ations and declar@@ es whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to make other users a better insight and more information in working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes every element in detail . everything about possibilities and borders is described in a simple way .
this is the root element of a di@@ XML document . it can only be used once in a document . it can contain definition of many tags but contains only one element type over itself otherwise nothing else .
the type of tags is a script function . when using it &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only for the Tag@@ typ class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type of method . returns the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common attri@@ but@@ ary group and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ day is determined . this is a single element type element .
&quot; describes a attri@@ bute of a tags . this element can only happen once for any attri@@ bute . in addition , it sets the name and type of the attri@@ bute . in addition , it contains additional tags that is to describe how this attri@@ bute is to display &amp; etc . this is a single element @-@ type element . &quot;
is the used source used for the attributes used in the tag Edi@@ tor@@ dialog and in the attri@@ bute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p @-@ meth@@ od@@ name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; is used to achieve data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a cutting @-@ link and a method name . the arguments that will be delivered to method . may be empty or % day@@ name % , which means the name of the current tags . &quot;
a tank @-@ day that group@@ ed the elements of a list together . it can only happen for a attri@@ but@@ ary description only once . it is a only @-@ element element .
the position of the attri@@ but@@ able of a tags within a dialogue is fixed . this day may occur for each attri@@ bute in a dialogue only once ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
indicates the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present every field in dialogue ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Day ) . this element is empty .
specify a list of elements that may occur within the all @-@ defined tags . this item is a single element type .
specify a list of elements that finish a day . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; -@@ declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 enco@@ ding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be tidy and closed .
&quot; space does not affect anything , but pay attention to &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; Tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; replaced . this will not make a leg , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to verify the equ@@ XML files , the tools is to start dialog at the top of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; -@@ window to start and veri@@ fied Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialogue will appear to follow its simple instructions . &quot;
&quot; this function is currently not available . at present , the check only takes place when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l . &quot;
in the following an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; -@@ element of the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ Schema . the filename for this di@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
&quot; in the following an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; delivery feature is described . the filename of this equ@@ XML file is to be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag . &quot;
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; enco@@ ding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; &quot; function _ name &quot; type = &quot; string _ name = &quot; option &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt;
the &amp; fun@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ file is also quite simple and there is an editor to be accessible via D@@ T@@ D Bear@@ b@@ working D@@ T@@ D settings ; for one from a list select@@ able &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created with following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = us@@ de 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = D@@ T@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Tran@@ si@@ tional / / EN ) Nickname = The simpli@@ fied name of the D@@ T@@ D . ( html 4.@@ 01 Tran@@ si@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as Nickname . &quot;
an action can be set with settings actions ... click on New action leads to the same dialogue :
this action has a weight@@ ed keyboard . with clicking on the user interface can be assigned a short@@ cut of keyboard ; with K@@ one is the current touch of the short@@ cut .
the simpl@@ est actions . it can be given a text in the det@@ erg@@ ed settings and in execution of the action this text is inserted in the document at the current C@@ urs@@ or position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts ) , but it is not limited to change or use as a input ( or parts of the document ) , even if you are using ( or parts of the document ) , even if you are using ( or parts of the document ) , for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ P . &quot;
first the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter are stated . example : sh / home / my@@ Home / my@@ scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
&quot; although qualified paths allowed , is it recommended that % scrip@@ t@@ dir Vari@@ able to use at the command line : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variations that can be used in the command line : &quot;
% f : we are replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file is removed from the document name .
% p@@ id : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the running &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ca ; only one instance runs ; the text Uni@@ que is made to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ca ; by external script .
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the filename of the current document or the path to project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the above @-@ described methods , a script can be saved from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; on the standard input . in the selection sheet input can be determined , which is to send to the default task . possibilities are : &quot;
selected Text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
&quot; according to the input , the output of the added application can be introduced . there are two types of output : normal output , written on the default edition ; radio , on the default output format . it can be specified on the default edition containing the value the drop @-@ box issue is set : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the mark@@ eup language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . in given case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the brand . &quot;
&quot; once a work@@ load is added , you must add promotions and configure settings . select settings actions . &quot;
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts the Edit mode .
fill in all necessary fields and add the same day to the matching material .
&quot; complete all and , if the day attributes , and you are planning to plan their use , enable dialogue &quot; &quot; edit &quot; &quot; if available , so a entry when using the promotion is possible . &quot;
&quot; ignore ! is this a ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this icon , we replace it before we have difficulties . &quot;
&quot; for creating a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; k@@ icon@@ edit ; use it from the &amp; k@@ menu ; , graphics other programs ( or where otherwise it is located in their distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; icon@@ icon@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol does not only helps you to remember what the action is doing , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the day start , I have decided to create a divi@@ ding as a symbol . through the use of green ( green is usually interpreted as los , rest@@ art , further interpreted ) , or should at least to sign@@ aled a message to the user that click on this symbol ; start the day in the current document . &quot;
&quot; following the creation of symbol , it must still be linked to action . this happens through the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; ) and selecting the desired action . in addition to the text box is one button , press him . &quot;
&quot; select the folder , in which the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the apply button and put them with other tags , so there are still which indicates , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
suppose you want to complement some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; -@@ functions to work together or it should adjust this to a better overview by some separ@@ ators in multiple groups . opening the work@@ loads using settings work@@ loads . ensure that the item is selected is selected .
&quot; I want to choose the separ@@ ator ( on the left top ) for my work@@ loads . after selecting the element@@ ary , which is to be added to the tool@@ bar , push the arrow key to the right . this adds the item to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I want to have a quick way to access the con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the workshop . &quot;
&quot; please note , like the separ@@ ators support the group@@ ing . someone who do not know my work@@ load , could believe that the con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button the opposite of the start @-@ button . &quot;
&quot; the new tool@@ bar must be tested by Pro@@ b@@ ating all symbols , to ensure that everything works . &quot;
&quot; back to the correct folder . after Neu@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be saved in the right folder , but your work@@ loads should be saved in the right folder . please adjust their files to the appropriate folder ( s ) if a file is opened from the appropriate type . &quot;
perhaps the mentioned extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the form@@ ative language that you like most about . therefore this chapter describes this chapter as I have a &amp; PHP ; -@@ Docum@@ entation Tree for my personal use .
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory check whether someone has done this for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you have to search a existing documentation for the format / script / etc . then you need to create the doc@@ r@@ c file . then we have to leave the doc@@ r@@ c file . we have to leave the second part here . &quot;
# KDE Con@@ figur@@ ation file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = pf@@ ad , relatively to this file , # second@@ 42 / # elements in the main index section 2 = # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.3 , # second@@ 1 , tag@@ 1 , tag@@ 1 , tag@@ 1 , tag@@ 1 , tag@@ 1 , tag@@ 1 , tag@@ 1 , tag@@ 1 , tag@@ 1 , tag@@ 1 , tag@@ 1 , tag@@ 1 , tag@@ 1 = day @-@ day @-@ day @-@ day &quot;
the section tree defines the visible portion of the documentation in the documentary tree . for example now you can see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation is something :
&quot; # KDE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = php@@ 42 / # top level , # For@@ getting Start@@ ed = Intro@@ duction , # For@@ getting Start@@ ed = Intro@@ duction , ... Intro@@ duction = audi@@ tion@@ .html ... Language Reference = Basic Syntax , ... Basic Syntax = langu@@ age.@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .html ... &quot;
note the # from getting start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is about sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for chess training ( except by reason ) md@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
remember that this is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consistent at the top end of the construction view &amp; md@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
space does not affect anything but pay attention to &amp; and &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ca ; Res@@ ourc@@ end@@ ental .
&quot; the ingredi@@ ent section is the area of the doc@@ r@@ c file , which is intended to display the documentation for the my@@ sql _ fetch _ array function . through mark@@ ings of the function and g@@ aps of C@@ tr@@ l ; H for context help , the documentation would display directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file @-@ binding . &quot;
&quot; a simple list of supported context @-@ separated context elements , which should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot;
now you can save your file doc@@ r@@ c simply save and go to $ HO@@ ME / qu@@ anta / doc / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( such as doc@@ r@@ c and copy your HTML documentation ) in the same folder as doc@@ r@@ c and copy your HTML documentation .
&quot; if you are sure that these are good and worth to be shared , send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation have been used to the &amp; qu@@ antum protection ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; -@@ community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best Web@@ development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; you are not alone . it is possible to divide the resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , work@@ loads with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; resources can be sent via email to friends , partners or otherwise . at different places there is an email to send menu , such as D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; users can download them . the contributions are checked and only made available when our team will be used as correct and beneficial for publication . so that the origin of the resources are guaranteed , both for our team and for later users . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you are asked for their private g@@ PG key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the case that you have multiple keys you may need a look . in the dialog New resource , you may have to keep an account . in the dialog New resource , you can stay empty ) and by clicking on OK the upload will be started . &quot;
&quot; the high load may be upload by the menus D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) upload , work@@ loads workshop , and in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree will be started . &quot;
&quot; after downloading an resource , still before the installation , examined &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; the im@@ munity of the resource by verification of the integrity and the Sig@@ nific@@ ation . in case of problems there and it can then be cancelled . if the integrity is given and the resource is correct , a message appears with the specification of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work on XML languages , which is currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; it can be time to work by using a D@@ TE@@ P package . it gives the easi@@ est way to convert a D@@ T@@ D automatically into a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
&quot; the conversion can be started from the menu D@@ T@@ D shop and conver@@ ge of a D@@ T@@ D description . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ T@@ D description , which should be used . afterwards , the following dialog appears : &quot;
target name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE Defini@@ tions : the string string working in ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE tag how HTML Public - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / D@@ T@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Tran@@ si@@ tional / / EN http : / / www.w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ ml@@ 4 / lo@@ os@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d should appear
&quot; fine @-@ setting of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion , when activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; after conversion the &amp; h@@ ant@@ r@@ c ; -@@ Editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended . it is recommended to use this opportunity . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; there are a number of key concepts . in order to understand this and full benefit from &amp; qu@@ antum concepts , this chapter must first be familiar with these fundamental concepts . this chapter seeks to bring them closely with these fundamental concepts , without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ca ; few benefits . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; the work@@ space is divided into three areas : global , locally and proj@@ ection . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for each one , the &amp; qu@@ antum department , is available . by work@@ loads about actions it is all that is marked as globally in the joint ordination structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; this allows the group of administ@@ rators different work@@ loads , actions and patterns in the global tree available each in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web development for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and work@@ loads . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
&quot; project @-@ related items are available only within a particular project . this can be everything from a specific project . simply said , this is the most limited size . all elements are filed in the folder tree of the project , which means the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the Edi@@ tor@@ window , the buil@@ ders , the cart@@ on@@ es with information and the work@@ loads . please hit in , and for further information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click the cart@@ on with the right mouse button to get a context @-@ menu with the current document of documents , un@@ loading , delete or loading the document , jump to a book@@ marks or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; legal conditions in the Edi@@ tor@@ sector guide to a further context @-@ menu regarding the edited document contents , such as basic processing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , edit the file under the mouse cur@@ sor or opening the file , if the string is called a file under the mouse cur@@ sor . &quot;
&quot; at the top end of the Edi@@ tor@@ ate window , the work@@ loads of the Edi@@ tors . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Tran@@ si@@ tional is shown as standard for which a set of work@@ loads can be shown to the new features and so connected users needs . &quot;
&quot; the use of work@@ loads is really light . if they want to insert a simple day , e.g. &amp; lt ; then click on the icon that the day represents , then you can insert the data for this straight . if you want to insert the data for this straight ( like An@@ ker ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields . &quot;
&quot; the Construction views ( Q@@ IT ; ) enable it to navig@@ ate in the information about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ca ; navig@@ ate them to open and through cart@@ on . in the representation with cart@@ ons stand for files , project , designs , scripts , attributes , and documentation building views . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool , which provides &amp; qu@@ antum service . this view shows all files in the project and allows the wo@@ unds of files in the project by means right mouse @-@ click . actions such as adding , removal , high or delete the files from storage medium can be performed with the delivery menu . &quot;
another option of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , programming parts , a whole web site &amp; etc . it will give you all the options open . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories , depending on what context they are used . global templates are always available , local templates are available only for the appropriate user and templates in projects are available only in the project . &quot;
&quot; here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of the structures in Global , Local and Project will also work here . by clicking on the right mouse button you can access the available information on a script , like e.g. the script to start , edit or send an email . &quot;
&quot; with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . by links @-@ cli@@ ffs of an element of an element , the cur@@ sor is set in the document on the position of the element@@ ary . by right @-@ clicking on an element opens a list of commands in terms of navigation and re@@ fres@@ her of the tree . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears below the other building views . with it can change man@@ quickly attributes , and nam@@ esp@@ ace . this allows modification of all available attributes with a few clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation on the Web @-@ technology for your development . there can be pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ca ; it can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be copied , edit and be considered . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; two cart@@ on at the bottom of the window can be reached on the useful information : the news window and the problem window . &quot;
this cardboard box displays information about each in Qu@@ anta @-@ running script . such example the D@@ T@@ D of the current document and all changes are displayed on the D@@ T@@ D .
&quot; this cardboard box displays all errors in the mark@@ ings of the current document . &amp; qu@@ antum , scripts , giving all the radio ( so there are ) in this window . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; work@@ loads are extensive and easy to understand . show it on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command , the chocolate is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; to define . &quot;
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; is the ability to send a work@@ loads with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; send the work@@ loads as a comp@@ actor T@@ ar archive through &amp; k@@ mail ; if they receive a tool@@ bar in an e @-@ mail ; they can safeguard these in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; how any other secure and load !
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to adjust the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ca ; files on your system . therefore , auto@@ conf can be delivered to the configure script . to provide a complete list of options that can be transferred to the configure script . the options are simple to understand and not executed here . &quot;
if you have problems with starting from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 I folder contains . also you should ensure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H in front of her bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; is a web development tool for the KDE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; was optimized for a swift Web @-@ development and combines a mature development environment with a multitude of powerful functions .
&quot; during the effort , the best &amp; HTML ; -@@ editor to create , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ca ; a peculi@@ ar , exten@@ sible Mark@@ up languages would be ? well , this would make him an absolutely great Web @-@ development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML , is limited to &amp; qu@@ antum &apos;s . now , if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then it should be &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; it should be the appropriate &amp; IDE . &quot;
&quot; now , to the afor@@ ementioned requirements must be noted that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; as a product is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developers . &amp; qu@@ antum ; this is not only this all possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; thus to expand how they need it for their need . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; allows web@@ developers to increase the use of a intui@@ tively and powerful Multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can expand productivity almost every task . through the program alization can be able to remember them &amp; qu@@ antum service . ( more about it can be found in . )
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web developing environment for HTML and related languages . it was developed for quick web development and was quickly expanded to a well @-@ established editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GPL @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more in the details of the documentation is using help : / qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ help@@ center help : / qu@@ anta ) . &quot;

&quot; when it is book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries related or next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sor in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other open documents appear in the menu group@@ ed according to the data stream of the other documents .
opens a existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; -@@ projects are stored with the file &apos;s file .
presents a dialog to inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
&quot; sear@@ ches the project directory to new files that might be there . that enables , e.g. graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folder , and then add them to the project . &quot;
load files in your project on the server high . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; starting from and whether you have downloaded further inputs / output modules ( K@@ IO Sl@@ aves ) .
settings such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; the project managed . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ca ; projects can be explained in the details .
&quot; load a project leader . these are preserved in project you / tool@@ bar , and are only in this menu if you have assigned to this project . &quot;
&quot; a dialog to store your work@@ loads . allows you to select the type of work@@ loads : locally or project . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions must be saved by settings actions ... added . work@@ loads will be saved through work@@ loads , or you will be saved on account whether you want to save the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; remo@@ ves a tool@@ bar from the point of view . the proceeds from the hard@@ disk . if you have not saved the work@@ loads , you will ask if you would like to do that . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to send their own work@@ loads to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; -@@ Team , thus the work@@ loads in the next publication is available ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as an app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; allows the load of work@@ loads on the main server , where everyone can access it . see in . &quot;

&quot; this menu includes a list of tags , which is currently available in current work@@ loads . if the standard ( HTML ; ) work@@ loads is loaded in the tags Menu a sub@@ menu standard , which contains the list of tags / actions on this factory . &quot;
allows access to the current day entry dialog if there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tags always present , followed by &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates or disabled the intelligent inser@@ ting of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; the inser@@ ting using work@@ load is ref@@ used when this day is contra@@ dic@@ tory to this place . &quot;

&quot; immediate revers@@ al between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the KDE libraries can cause the revers@@ al sometimes time need or un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the cart@@ on mode , which is also the default mode , which is the display in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu features an open sub@@ window an entry . with a selection of one entry , the appropriate sub@@ window will be activated . &quot;
&quot; the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; the main window , or off . &quot;
the changes in this dialog affects every application that use the K@@ HTML Part including the con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Web@@ browsers .
the behavior of the Edi@@ tor@@ er &apos;s behavior is one . in the documentation of &amp; k@@ ates ; you can find details .
&quot; a dialog appears , in which you can delete or add or add the sequ@@ ences and change the sequ@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; this should produce a help according to the environment of the mouse , but is not implemented yet . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and free , but as with any open source project the developers can always support help . if they want to support the developers in financial form , they find here the way . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled out at the top of the project , for example , after the filling of the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will automatically be completed with shi@@ py@@ ard ; F@@ 7 project project properties can be adjusted later . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project , for example foo . when entering name , file is automatically filled . &quot;
&quot; this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ antum service . by default , she has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case and without a space with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory . &quot;
&quot; here you can access the server address of the machine , to which one wants to access local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ examp@@ le.@@ ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; lets you use this field empty , the default settings of the chosen proto@@ cols are used . depending on the setting of the remote computer , an adaptation may be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a common collection of files used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standards . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the work@@ loads can be stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standards . &quot;
this allows to add files from the local file system into the project . there are multiple files or whole folder .
&quot; this setting is great when you have a static site you want to download and change . if you want to change the script ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc . ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , should be incorporated within the main folder of the project . if a project is started at new , not An@@ h@@ ook . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folder are displayed within the main folder , and you can make a exact selection of re@@ th@@ inner . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can choose the files from h@@ h@@ ooks , or , by removing the tick , braces out of the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that can simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can be upload in the menu associated with project properties in the menu window or with the keyboard Shi@@ ft ; F@@ 7 changed .
some settings correspond to those in the project assist@@ ants and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of data @-@ related operations ( Plac@@ eholders can be found ) that will be re @-@ related to project @-@ related operations such as project ord@@ ner .
&quot; compl@@ ement@@ ary option to the above , also files that are listed in .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which will be loaded at the opening of the project . in more about project views . &quot;
&quot; with this , the desired de@@ bug@@ ger can be selected . currently only Gub@@ ed is supported . more information about Gub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bug@@ ger plugin can be adjusted with the button options . in the de@@ bug@@ ger will be described . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window profiles can be upload up@@ la@@ de@@ profiles ( see in ) , as well as the display of a construction view for the contents of the server for each profile , using their own construction view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window Team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mail@@ ing list . see in the details . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window of event configur@@ ations you can switch event actions and add these actions to change or delete . event actions will be executed when a previous event occurs , such as the backup of a file . see in the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , the last project that was opened . this behavior cannot be influ@@ ential . &quot;
&quot; to open another project , select project ... from the menu or the symbol of the project open out of the workshop . the dialog project will open and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as enlargement . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; closed , the project file will be automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ antum ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
&quot; the project exec@@ uting gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project . &quot;
&quot; folder beh@@ ave , however ab@@ sent the entries to open and opening up ... in with the right mouse button of the click @-@ menu : &quot;
&quot; here , various profiles can be chosen . the profile contains information about the location of the high @-@ read files . see . &quot;
&quot; allows the removal of the current profile . if only a profile present , the button is loaded , to prevent the removal . &quot;
&quot; the password will be kept in the core memory and forget about programming . this option is useful when most common high load files is needed , and which is rather un@@ secure password on the record -@@ option not to be found in question . &quot;
this will stop transmission or simply leave the dialog if you change your opinion before the high load .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; many high speed profiles can be uploaded , and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) are uploaded to various servers . when using a profile , this dialog will be displayed : &quot;
this is the name of the server to which the files are to be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address function .
the transfer protocol for the high load . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ IO Sl@@ aves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; to file ( locally ) and n@@ fs .
&quot; the port for transfer . normally , this does not have to be changed unless the network administrator operates a service not at the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your att@@ achment thres@@ hold this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use them according to your discretion . the password is stored on the record , so that it cannot be easily read , but everyone can see with programming languages . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only a set of files and work@@ loads . it can be loaded in a project many views , i.e. by simple exchange of view can be loaded various files and work@@ loads and replace the current files and work@@ loads . &quot;
&quot; views can be stored in the menu or project workshop , accessible via settings of the same project work@@ loads , opened or deleted . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ antum , with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; at its own way . &quot;
as mentioned above are work@@ loads in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ca ; most likely to distinguish between the menu work@@ loads designed . use and add @-@ to @-@ date . adding work@@ loads is dealt with in the section Ad@@ ding of work@@ loads .
&quot; the work@@ loads and symbols are set to be carried out either by the context menu ( right @-@ clicking on the work@@ load ) , in which with new action , a new tool@@ bar can be implemented , which can be specified in the dialog , what actions can be stated on this or other work@@ loads . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context men@@ tioning to an action ( icon ) on a work@@ load , in addition , the entries will remove and displayed action , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the work@@ loads and the actions on them can set up in the menu with settings work@@ loads ... and settings actions can be set .. .
&quot; templates are essentially tool@@ chain , code cut@@ lets and files on linked . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; uses templates , basically like a major file system with enhanced organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or each at the system existing directory in the deposits . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; in about the restrictions you submit for the file system . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; provided templates have terms and conditions for their use . please read the conditions stated at the beginning of each template .
&quot; bin@@ ary is all that is not pure text . it can be inserted any file except text , so pictures , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc . bin@@ ary templates are usually included in the pre @-@ storage area under global templates . further information on the templates is available . &quot;
&quot; documents can be created by any text Docum@@ entation . based on this templates , new documents can be created . normally , a simple od@@ ours for the purpose and organising the work in appropriate way to be efficient . some examples can be found in the storage area under global templates . see for more information on the templates . &quot;
&quot; this kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area always included in the documents . you can find everything , from a comment via a complete menu system on Jav@@ as@@ cript or Perl base . some examples are found in the pre @-@ storage area under global templates . see for more information on the templates . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , this templates for whole web sites as templates . they are a collection of different documents , which can be organized in a folder structure , in a com@@ pressed t@@ ar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ antum . &quot;
&quot; design a document structure for exposure to exposure ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc . ) and choose a file As a template save as local template .... &quot;
&quot; as soon as it happen , you notice that ( even if it was stored as a project basis ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look in the pre @-@ storage facility under project templates . &quot;
select text in your document and then click File As a template store selection as local / project system . alternatively , the selection can easily be with@@ drawn with pul@@ ling and put on the construction site templates . &quot;
&quot; the creation of bin@@ ary templates is simple : the file can only copy into a pre @-@ used folder . you can use all file management functions to be used , so about pul@@ ling and add or add the file tree of kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can click in the file tree or in the project files to select a folder on the right and secure site template . by default , it is assured as local or global template as local or global template . &quot;
project orders also enable a very target @-@ oriented precau@@ tionary . you can add head@@ lines and foot@@ ers or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; create files or link with them . additionally you can keep some things when using templates in projects very profound .
&quot; the default structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / qu@@ anta / templates / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / dispos@@ able files . each of this folder corresponds to one of four types of containers , as explained above . &quot;
&quot; to set the behavior of a folder , click on the folder by clicking on the folder and select the context @-@ menu properties . the following dialog appears : &quot;
a selection with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is v@@ ending , as soon as el@@ ective attri@@ bute is attached . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and fit for everything except the stem cell phones . if a regular folder would be dis@@ able , unless they would be explicitly enabled . in the case of a normal folder , the bl@@ ah would appear with something like text elements . if nothing appears , you probably appears in a stem cell . &quot;
permits or posted text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ ers for all the templates for a specific project and allows for copying from summar@@ ies in a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers .
&quot; in addition , you are using the context menu ( show it , right mouse button to press ) via a complete satisfaction collection for the addition of folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor , the first mode replaced the source text editor , replaced by the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the double page shares the Edi@@ tor@@ window into two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor . &quot;
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : he loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor . then one can edit and when needed to source code editor in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor in source code are visible .
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor on a document , which contains a small green symbol the V@@ oh@@ and@@ sions of &amp; PHP ; -@@ Editor . it is not possible to edit them directly with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor . to edit it , the source text editor is necessary . there is no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works just like the first one , except for the same time the changes can be activated in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor syn@@ ch@@ ron is active , this mode is already active , moving the active cur@@ sor from one window to another , whereby the position in the document is maintained . &quot;
the sync point between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source text editor can be set up via settings of Qu@@ anta .... After choice of V@@ PL ; view it can be set between synchron@@ isation after one click or automatically . in the selection automatically the recommendations can be set aside for quick calcul@@ ators and a big jum@@ ps for slow .
&quot; suppose you want to change the title of the website , enabling the processing of invisible tags in work with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor possible . the document properties is also called , as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor &apos;s documentation is created . this allows for the dimin@@ ishing of the suspension lat@@ ine . this allows you to change the following : &quot;
&quot; Meta @-@ tags , the storage of information about the document itself . Meta @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or remo@@ ves . one click on the list allows modification of content , e.g. key words on the column name and keywords keyword ( keyword key ) of the contents of column . &quot;
CSS rules are the new way to design the look of pages in the browser . you can add CSS rules with the buttons on the list or delete a change about the list is possible . the Edit of CSS rules are currently not supported .
it is possible to submit an external CSS @-@ style system by selecting the file button and choose the corresponding file .
&quot; the use of the cur@@ sor is like in a text editor , by moving with the paths , possible . under rare circumstances the cur@@ sor does not beh@@ ave like usual . text can be inserted by inserted and deleted using a taste or remo@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; the inser@@ ting of tags is used in the same way over the work@@ loads , as in the source text editor , it is to be noted that inser@@ ting tags previously already existing identical tags for example if an an@@ chor @-@ day , sur@@ round with text , every other surrounding an@@ chor drops . &quot;
&quot; some work@@ loads like the tables @-@ assistant or the lists @-@ assistant are disabled . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; work , in this release , the tables or lists of work can be used in this release . &quot;
&quot; &amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; is a tool for investigation of breast@@ feeding systems . in contrast to other programs , the search for specific elements is possible and the execution of the style system can be followed . &quot;
&quot; to compile &amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; successful compile , need except &amp; k@@ de ; still the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ als and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are already present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de . &quot;

&quot; there are many graphic tools for the same . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly , why I have written . &quot;
&quot; the compilation was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors have done many changes and at the same time correc@@ ted the inser@@ tion . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result were numerous conflicts with together . &quot;
&quot; the program used to me only showed me the modified lines , but I could not see what exactly changed inside this line . and there was no references to the places where perhaps only the rec@@ ti@@ fication had changed . this changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
so that was the start . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within a row and changes to white characters . later the amount of other useful functions were added .
&quot; if you want to compare fast text , simply copy it into the clip@@ board and add it into one of the compar@@ es . &quot;
a function made the much work was the same and merge of folders . this function changed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a fully @-@ called file browser .
&quot; also 3 @-@ way together is fully supported . this is useful when two people work independently of a piece of co@@ de and changes . the original file ( the base ) helps &amp; k@@ diff@@ use . in this editor , you can even edit the result . in this editor , you can even edit the result . in this editor , you can even edit the result . in this editor , you can even edit the result . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three qu@@ ell files in this editor : &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you with the same and together complete folder . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder @-@ assembled :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and tell us the possibilities of active colour mon@@ it@@ ore . if you frequently have to check Ko@@ de , you will like this function . &quot;
Differences in white characters and tab@@ ul@@ ators are shown visible . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters , one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no hass@@ le anymore , if Jem@@ and the rec@@ y changes . ) &quot;
&quot; when a file is equal , and the other diff@@ ers in a row , then the colour indicates which file is different . red color means that both files are different . &quot;
&quot; if all files are the same name , but in various folders , then you can fully simpli@@ fy yourself by the stream of the first file . example : &quot;
Re@@ vie@@ 3 Read@@ y@@ 2 folder 1 folder 2 folder 1 folder 2 folder 1 folder 2 orders 3 k@@ ick@@ ed 1 folder 2 folders
&quot; opening @-@ dialog enables the manual tap of data entry , the selection via the file browser ( file ... ) or the exclusion of a recently opened file from the up@@ lift list . you do not have to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of differences are carried out with two files . &quot;
&quot; via the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you choose a folder , the same or merge together by orders . if for A file is selected , for B and C however , a folder , then uses a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ us@@ 3 ; the filename from A to the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; when assem@@ bling the input field is active , the input field is active and can be dealt with . however , it is not necessarily required to immediately set up a output file . you can get this step later in memory . &quot;
the set @-@ button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before you begin with the inter@@ viewer .
&quot; sometimes you do not want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to choose text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison table . the comparison starts immediately . in opening @-@ dialog , you do not have to select any files , you can simply tap the dialog with the Canc@@ el button . &quot;
you can also use pul@@ ling and insert : just drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison table .
&quot; which thought does it ? sometimes a file contains for example several similar functions . if you want to find out how much similar functions are , it would be a relatively large effort . you &apos;d just want to load the relevant files in &amp; k@@ diff@@ use . now you can copy the relevant sections simply , insert and then compare . &quot;
&quot; note : at present , you can find nothing from &amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; only the for@@ r@@ als is supported by text in a comparison table . &quot;
warning : some editors interpre@@ t the pul@@ ling and insert text into another program as a cutting and insert ( instead of copying and inser@@ ting ) . in such case your original data could be lost .
&quot; in the upper part of each text window is the info line . the info @-@ line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the filename and the Zei@@ l@@ number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C optional is . ) Je@@ de Info @-@ line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse a little bit over the line . then a small aid window will display the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three types of source are the letters A , B and C . a has the colour blue , B the colour green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these preferences can be changed over the settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when a difference is recognized , one sees in the color that file is different . if both files are different . ( colour for conflicts in attitudes ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . this is in the next section ( merge ) good . &quot;
&quot; links next to the text is the summary column . if differences have been found , the column shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + for example , the white characters are relevant only in strings and comments , for pre@@ processor and in a few , rare individual cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line , which separ@@ ates the summary column of the text , will be interrupted on the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the period is activated , the line is shown in fine lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( under the previous output ) also has a info line with the wor@@ ding edition : , the filename and &#91; changed &#93; if you have edited the result . usually it contains by the automatic compos@@ ing already text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are dis@@ solved is the s@@ ali@@ va de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the buttons to be found to the remaining sol@@ dered / un@@ resolved conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two compar@@ es are used , each difference is also a conflict which must be solved manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the group appears to be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will not be visible . ) This group will then be highlighted the current group . it is highlighted with the colour background color for current range and on the left appears a black beams . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , by automatic compos@@ ing or by manual editing any more line more in the group ; then , this text is displayed in source . this text is only a position for the event that you may change your opinion and maybe show another source . this text appears neither in the final stored file , nor in a mark@@ er that you might want to copy and paste . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; contr@@ action ; however , in the clip@@ board , however , appears in the clip@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . go careful with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting the sources the options include numbers , or I@@ gn@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments are enabled , changes in numbers or comments are treated like white characters . &quot;
&quot; navig@@ ate mainly with the image and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are used in one of the window , you can also use the arrows icon , right , high , end , Str@@ g @-@ beginning and Str@@ g @-@ end , si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . the over@@ sight@@ ed column can be used as well as to navig@@ ate . &quot;
in the Aug@@ ab@@ ef@@ tab you can also use the other keys to Edit . with the Inser@@ ted button you can switch between plug @-@ in and over@@ read mode . ( advance is the entry @-@ gem@@ o@@ dus ) .
&quot; one click with the left mouse button in one of the summar@@ izing columns , the view of all windows see the beginning of the respective group ( as previously announced in the section and the edi@@ table output window was explained ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons on navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ below ) , to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ below ) , to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ Picture down@@ hill ) or to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ Picture down@@ hill ) or to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ Picture down@@ hill ) or to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ Picture down@@ hill ) or to the next / previous conflict . therefore , you have to resolve conflicts between deleted and un@@ resolved conflicts . &quot;
&quot; to copy the mark@@ ings into the clip@@ board , you must copy the copying -@@ button ( Str@@ g @-@ C or Str@@ g @-@ Inser@@ t ) . there is also the option selection automatically . be with this option but careful , because you could over@@ take the content of the clip@@ board . &quot;
po@@ len@@ ders are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix @-@ variants are using a line@@ count + line@@ age \ \ r \ . K@@ diff@@ use \ \ r \ . K@@ diff@@ use \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 reserves the po@@ stage of source files for that reason you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ us@@ 3 ; it is also not used with bin@@ ary files .
the options and the list of the most recently used files will automatically be saved and delivered at the next start . ( menu Paramet@@ ers@@ - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... )
&quot; select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides fon@@ ts with adjust@@ . width to choose from , you should not use this but not . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , differences are shown in cur@@ sive script . if the chosen script does not support this representation does not happen at all . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors may not be available in its pure form but would be saved . on these systems the button pre @-@ settings will automatically create an un@@ preced@@ ented color . &quot;
&quot; when this option is enabled , the wir@@ es of the tab@@ ulator button is inserted in the appropriate number of spaces . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator is inserted . &quot;
&quot; if you are entering or return , the deposit will be automatically used for the next row . &quot;
&quot; when this option is activated , each selection will automatically be copied into the clip@@ board . the manual copy into the clip@@ board then falls . &quot;
you can select which po@@ stage type you prefer to Save . the specified value is the common usual selection of the used operating system .
&quot; at the same of files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first to find all the identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . in this step , the second step compar@@ es any line . this step will not be ignored . in this step , white characters will not be ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a car mark &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a new@@ len@@ ring &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a row , but then they could only be ignored . if this option may be activated , however , as a white character are covered . while keeping this option must be disabled . in the default , this option is disabled . &quot;
&quot; in default this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , figures and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) . in the result the differences are still shown , but they are treated like white characters . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters . &quot;
intense after still small differences . the option is activated in the default . it is effective at complicated and big files but slowly at very large files .
&quot; in the automatic @-@ re@@ direc@@ tional mode , this option determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue . &quot;
&quot; if you require automatic all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as a source . ( prescribed selection . ) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important , then take advantage of the automatic selection of conflicts in numbers or comments , when the options ignore or I@@ gn@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments are activated . &quot;
&quot; these options are treated in the chapter for digi@@ tization of folders and run a compilation . look for details under documentation for directory , comparison and arrangement . &quot;
&quot; if a file is stored and already exists an older version , then the original version exists the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if already such a back@@ up@@ file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g exists , this will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
&quot; fits the language of the user interface . the Changes this option does not affect the current program . you must finish &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; stop and re@@ boot so that the change is active in the KDE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available , because the language is set global over the control centre . ) &quot;
&quot; the following co@@ aches settings can be adjusted for each entry separately . if you activate this option , for all entries the upper setting will be used . &quot;
key@@ ing fields for the coding appears a short notice what the local coding is . ( this can not be changed here and has for you purely informal character . )
&quot; modify the file enco@@ ding for source files . this is how special characters are treated and interpre@@ t . since the coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files can be compared with different coding . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited one file , you can specify which coding can be used for memory . &quot;
&quot; if you define the work error messages , it may possibly not work with your co@@ dec . ( e.g. your files may 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code can only handle with 8 @-@ bit ASC@@ II . ) With this option , one can set the coding of the output of pre @-@ work error . &quot;
turn this to push forward of changes in white characters in the text or super@@ visory boards . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments when the options ignore or I@@ gn@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments are activated . )
&quot; this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode , all the differences in a color codi@@ fied over@@ sight@@ ed column . but sometimes you might just want to see the differences between two of three files . according to selection from A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C is still shown a second over@@ sight@@ ed column with the required information . &quot;
sometimes you would like to use the available space on the screen for long lines . blend the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
arranged the comparison table to each other . this can also be useful for ads of long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes you consider the differences and then decide immediately , the files will merge together . a simple click starts editing and use the filename from the last source file as the name for the output file . ( if this function is used to rest@@ art once again , the name of the last used file will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will be handed over to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ us@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ processor that corresponds exactly your requirements . you can use this function for example to cut disturb@@ ing parts or to correct the rec@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it was given first to this external command ( see above ) , then the output of the command is specified only at the time settings . you can write your own pre@@ processor that corresponds exactly your requirements . each entry line needs to have a related output line . &quot;
&quot; the thought behind it is to allow users more flexibility when dealing with the di@@ ff results . however , there is an external program needed , and most users would like to program the good news , however , that in most cases sed or per@@ l entirely sufficient . &quot;
&quot; use this pre @-@ work error for time to convert : sed } &apos;s / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 1 / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; CV@@ S and other release control systems use some key words to add ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word Sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while you are experim@@ enting with sed , you might begin to understand it and perhaps like this regular phr@@ ases even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; the ignor@@ ance of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of a further pre @-@ working error for periods , the &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 456@@ 78@@ 9.- &#93; / / g &apos;@@ Every@@ one sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and every hit will be replaced by nothing , so quasi . &quot;
sometimes you might want to perform several re@@ plac@@ ements at once . then you can use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the re@@ plac@@ ements .
instead of sed you can also use something different such as per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / switches &apos; aller@@ dings are different with per@@ l some details different . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs per@@ l only ( and ) without the pre @-@ employed &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
&quot; the data according to the normal pre@@ processor are maintained for the display and to merge together . further operations are only changing the data , which is the time of the Zei@@ len@@ kl@@ th@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the periods will see the output of the normal pre @-@ process as a input . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or differences , you can not notice certain differences and destroy important data . &quot;
&quot; often , programmers have to edit a lot of files in a folder . for this reason you can compare with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder and merge . &quot;
... makes a suggestion for each object ; you can custom@@ ize the proposal before the start
... may this simul@@ ate and shows the simul@@ ated changes without it really carry out .
... &quot; selected promotions either with all ( F@@ 7 button ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 button ) , &quot;
this is similar to the same and merge of individual files very similar . you only need to open the folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; if three folder can be mer@@ ged , then folder 1 is used as a base . if no target folder was specified , used &amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; folder 3 as a destination folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , do not start playing together . to start the appropriate menus or press the F@@ 7 button . ( further details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; during the reading of the folder you will receive a small news window on current progress . if you break the sc@@ anning of the folder , only the files are listed , which were compared to then . &quot;
&quot; when the sc@@ anning of the folder is completed , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left hand side , ... &quot;
&quot; each file and each folder that was found during the scan , is shown here in a tree . you can choose an object with a simple mouse click . &quot;
&quot; the folder structure is usually shown together . you can click a folder by clicking on the + / - , or using the arrow buttons for left / right . the directory menu includes two functions to check out all the folder and all sub@@ directories can be loaded with all the folder . &quot;
&quot; if you click on a file , the file will be started and it appears a compar@@ tis@@ ation . &quot;
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
&quot; when the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object displayed . in such a case the contr@@ hr @-@ action is not automatically selected . if that merge together , you will be noti@@ fied of problems of this kind again . &quot;
&quot; how to see in the above picture , are used in the columns A / B / C the colors red , green , yellow and black . &quot;
&quot; for identical entries , the colour is also identical , even if the age of entries is different . &quot;
&quot; folder are regarded as identical , if their whole content is identical . then you also have the same color . in folders , the age is in@@ significant for its color . &quot;
&quot; the idea to this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf again , which is only green , then yellow becomes and later when it is old , red . &quot;
&quot; a and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a and B identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; B and C are identical , but not a : copy of A ( or if A not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a , B and C not have the same file type ( e.g. if A a folder and B file is ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tive data types . as long as such missing objects exist , this may not be started . &quot;
... A and B does not have the same file type ( e.g. if A a folder and B file is ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tive data types . as long as such missing objects exist , this may not be started . &quot;
&quot; the mode to synchroni@@ ze is active , if only two folder and no explic@@ it target folder . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action is identical , so that both folder are identical . if for an entry ... &quot;
&quot; a and B exist , but not identical : bring together and save the result in both folders . ( the user looks as a visible file name for the output file only B ; directly according to the assem@@ ble copies &amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; B to A. ) &quot;
&quot; when two folder can be mer@@ ged and the option Neu@@ ere file will be selected , then examined &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of files and suggests the newer file . if the files are identical , but the date is identical .. sol@@ ves such mistakes can not be eliminated . &quot;
&quot; during which mer@@ ged a file after the other hand , a file column shows Fer@@ me when that assembled together successfully , and according to other messages , when something has been completed , you should check out a final review and see if the status is all right . &quot;
&quot; when in the setup dialog the file compar@@ ative analysis is chosen , K@@ diff@@ ers 3 other columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , deleted , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for solved conflicts will only be displayed when three folder is compared or mer@@ ged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries selected at once . if you have selected all con@@ tain@@ able actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can merge this together . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you have no target folder , then will be used in the Three @-@ folder mode C as a destination that will be selected for B and / or B as a destination . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a target folder , please check if all entries are displayed in the target structure , also in the folder structure . there are some options listed by certain entries . check these options to avoid un@@ loving surprises : &quot;
to load all entries : select directories / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard ) . to run only the current entry process : select action of current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if by contra@@ dic@@ tory data types still exist , a message appears on the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select for them a valid action . &quot;
&quot; when you perform all entries , a dialog window will yield a dialog with the options to simul@@ ate and break down . &quot;
&quot; select simul@@ ating if you want to see what would happen , without which really changes will be done . you will then get a detailed list of all actions . &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then leads certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is necessary ( merge a single file ) then will pop up a merge window ( note the screen@@ shot ) .
&quot; when you are finished with a file , select again directory / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved , will be a corresponding dialogue . then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work with the next post . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on an error , a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you should help to ski@@ p the cause of the problem . so you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in another way before you proceed with the problem . &quot;
&quot; if some entries are individually compiled , these entries ( in the current session ) and results from all entries are not recorded again . even if here the data has been translated or not saved , these entries will be done . only if you change the assem@@ ble action , these entries will again be assembled . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... ) now has a section called directory co@@ uting with these options :
only files that fit on the specified pattern are shown in the element@@ ary model . separate the pattern with a Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; a valid placement : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . you do not have to match this pattern .
&quot; files and folder associated with this pattern are not shown in the element@@ ary tree . it can be more than a pattern , use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as a partition . valid placement : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folder associated with this pattern are not shown in the element@@ ary tree . it can be more than a pattern , use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as a partition . valid placement : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignored files that are also ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ matic generated files are ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder can be adjusted to a .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some fil@@ es@@ ystems , files are a default attri@@ bute . in other file systems marked a pre @-@ employed point . this option makes you decide whether these files are displayed in the element@@ ary tree , or not . this option is swit@@ ched in the default . &quot;
&quot; on links to files : when the option is de@@ activated , symbo@@ lic coupl@@ ings are compared . if the option is swit@@ ched , the files are compared to which the links will show . this is down@@ lighted in the default . &quot;
&quot; on links to folder : when the option is off , the symbo@@ lic links are compared . a link to a folder containing a link to itself would lead to an end@@ los@@ loop and r@@ ush@@ ed . ) This option is off in the default . &quot;
&quot; introduces a full analysis of each file by and shows the statisti@@ c columns . ( the number of deleted , un@@ chy , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is s@@ lower than a simple bin@@ ary analysis , and much s@@ lower when it is applied to files that does not contain any text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folder via a slow network , it may possibly be faster , just the change of change and the file size . however , this option is a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is available in default . &quot;
&quot; similar to the Chang@@ ing date , there is no real comparison . the files are considered as identical . this can be useful for example when copying the date of change . please be careful with caution . this option is available in default . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates the synchroni@@ ze mode when two folder are compared and no target folder was indicated . in this mode , the proposals will be assembled . also the results of the files are stored in both folders . this option is stored in the default . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , the copying of the newer file is proposed . ( this is considered un@@ clear , as it is provided that the other file has not been modified . ) This option is in any case automatically . ) This option is in default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or a folder is replaced or deleted , then the original version is ren@@ amed and receives the extension .@@ original . if an old backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g -@@ Extension is already exists , this will also affect the normal touch of individual files , not only the combined folder . this option is swit@@ ched in the default . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder containing the folder containing all of the files visible ; you can turn the folder with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want to switch to the window &amp; text@@ window , you can switch the main window in the window menu and switch off via change between directory &amp; text@@ window between the two views . &quot;
&quot; probably you prefer to compare a file using double @-@ clicking on . however , you can also put a single file directly via double @-@ clicking on the folder . once you use the result , the status will be done afterwards , and the file will not put together once again when you perform the folder . &quot;
&quot; however , this status will however be lost if you re @-@ read the directory again : directory -@@ Menu : new to read &quot;
&quot; KDE supports networking with the help of K@@ IO sl@@ aves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folder to opening up to local or remote computers . &quot;
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with a on a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a com@@ pressed archipelago with a local folder .
a URL has another syntax than local files and folder . a few things should you consider :
&quot; a path can be relatively . or .. contained , this is not possible with URL@@ s , these are always absolutely . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , blan@@ k - &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # foo # the URL file : / % 23@@ foo % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes because of the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol . it follows a brief list of constra@@ ints : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be differ@@ ed whether a link to a file or a folder displays . then , a file is assumed as a link @-@ purpose . ( FTP : , SF@@ TP : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no way to process calcul@@ ating or change date . therefore , the calculation or change date from the original . ( note the option confidential the size . ) ( This is only for local files possible . ) &quot;
&quot; the principal uses is currently in K@@ Devel@@ op . K@@ Devel@@ op always starts the built @-@ in differences in K@@ Devel@@ op . at K@@ Diff@@ 3 , you press the right mouse button on the differences viewer and then select in K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part view from the context menu . &quot;
usually requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input file . if it is used as a Part 3 ; it takes a patch file in the uni@@ fied format . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ us@@ 3 ; the names of the original files must exist . then the program patch to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in con@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Pre@@ view in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . moreover , this is un@@ reliable when the original files since the creation of the patch file has changed . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the same of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . merge together or the same of folders , is not supported in the K@@ Part mode . &quot;
tools with the name of K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now hei@@ st comp@@ are ) are already . moreover the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ use of the di@@ ff tool collection .
I am using GPL programs for a very long time and I learned a lot that I &apos;ve got into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all the programmers who have gone this way or go .
&quot; you have compiled the program from the sources and the configure script should not be communic@@ ated to the right Pre@@ fix to KDE . in the default configure / usr / local , but then KDE can not find resources for user interface ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ ui@@ .@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ ADM@@ E file you will find more information on this subject . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines will be treated as identical ; if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical . if gui@@ lines , next to each other , this im@@ is co@@ aches , this im@@ is , the case . &quot;
&quot; editor &apos;s editor for any difference in the files where he begins and where he ends . this is necessary to resolve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the Kn@@ op@@ ic A / B / C . this important information is however lost , if the result is easy to be saved as text file , and it &apos;s much effort to release extra a private file format that could save this information . &quot;
the effort was so far too big . you can restore a certain version ever through selecting a source A / B / C . to process larger quantities of text should be used another editor .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; no src has been laid ; appeared and the text cannot delete itself . what does it mean and how can this be removed ?
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; already uses many colors for the highlight of distinction . even more mor@@ dial sle@@ eves would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . use this , please use another editor . &quot;
many good ideas and bug@@ fixes came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you very much !
&quot; to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ us@@ 3 ; you can use &amp; k@@ de , 3.1 or newer . &quot;
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without KDE you can find on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found at http : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ forge@@ .net / CHAN@@ GEL@@ OG or in the file CHAN@@ EL@@ OG in the qu@@ ell package .
by &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the command in the basic folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution : &quot;
&quot; KDE @-@ You gives the folder in your system , installed in the KDE . if you are uns@@ ure , you will find further details in the RE@@ ADM@@ E file . &quot;
&quot; da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not have any problems with the compile . nevertheless , difficulties appear , report on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mail@@ ing@@ lists . &quot;
cut ( Str@@ g @-@ X or Um@@ sch@@ alt removal ) copies into the clip@@ board and delet@@ es the fields marked . insert ( Str@@ g @-@ V or Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ insert ) adds the text from the clip@@ board to the current cur@@ sor and re@@ places the current mark@@ ings .
&quot; only differences show : files that are identical in all folders , do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the target folder . &quot;
( in the current program version you have to update to changes to these options the folder with the function Updated . )
&quot; only entries are shown to indicate the differences . this also leads to that identical files are not stored in the target folder . if the target folder is not already copied , they are missing in a later program version . ) This option is in default . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons for selecting the source with the lab@@ eling A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines are attached from the appropriate window to the end of the selected group in the window window , if the lines are already present , they are removed when clicking on the button again . &quot;
&quot; in the default , this option is de@@ activated . Under@@ difference in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini@@ show of all virtual working spaces . it is quite convenient to change the current programs on the work areas to change their size , to finish or move them . this works both within a desktop and with several . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual travel areas , as well as the applications running in running applications . the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others . &quot;
&quot; with the middle mouse button you can move close to a window inside of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible , both within a desktop and other labour surfaces . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked on : if on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , the context menu has only shown the two entries of P@@ ager ... and be@@ ating . if however , click on an application within the application and the entries are minim@@ ize , maxim@@ ize , On the desktop and b@@ ending . the commands effect : &quot;
maxim@@ izing the application window on the full size of the desktop . appears only when on application was cli@@ cked .
send the application for the selected virtual desktop . appears only if at one application was cli@@ cked .
&quot; this approach is marked , you can move windows within the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other labour surfaces . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , are displayed in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the names of virtual labor spaces are displayed . &quot;
&quot; this field lets the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager can display the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of virtual labor surfaces . it will be displayed along with name , the names will be supplied with the ordin@@ arily , &amp; eg ; 1st working surface . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also shown as background in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed out , the current programs will be displayed as small windows in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , the empty spaces are shown to allow their selection . &quot;
&quot; here , the view of the program window is selected . simply shows the windows with its standard symbol . symbol shows the windows with its standard symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . remarks : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems . &quot;
&quot; here the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager will be determined : classic leaves &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , known as from P@@ ager applications in some other Window@@ manag@@ ers ; horizont@@ ally show all virtual working spaces in a horizont@@ ally and vertical in a sen@@ sed row , which is very good for the representation on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager Mini@@ programme in the Control bar . it has the advantage that it can be modified in size , the windows as symbols or with their content and can move . besides , he runs outside the control bar . &quot;
click the right button of mouse within the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent expression of switch switches ... makes the dialog settings appear .
currently it cannot be changed in the dialog settings . you can do this but manually :
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any tex@@ te@@ di@@ tor such as &amp; k@@ edit ; or VI@@ . if you don &apos;t have any writing to the file , you need to register as user root or login to your system administrator . in this file you have to add the key to Transpar@@ ent@@ Mode and this is a value . possible values are : &quot;
&quot; da &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package base , you need a functioning installation of KDE Basic package . &quot;

&quot; if you can use &amp; k@@ mag . you can use it with &amp; k@@ mag ; a part of the screen is enlarge , so as if you &apos;re reading a mag@@ ni@@ fier for the small printed or the exact spect@@ ators of a photo . this application is interesting for various users : this includes artists , web designers and people with a visual cr@@ acker . this documentation is meant to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mag ; is a powerful application , which is constantly enhanced by new functions . it is optimized for use on performance @-@ weak computers . &quot;
if you &amp; k@@ mag ; start a window as shown above . the main window of the screen is displayed .. The image that is displayed in enlar@@ ging window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window .
&quot; in the default default &amp; k@@ mag , the area around the Mou@@ se@@ er like a moving icons . alternatively , you can choose a selected screen area in the Mag@@ nific@@ ance window ( selection mode ) or the environment of the mouse button on the screen sav@@ er ( eg ; on the left screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid that the mouse cur@@ sor in the enlarged window is displayed , select the setting of mouse cur@@ sor . please note that it is still not able to recognize the form of the mouse . this is always the default @-@ k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ Maus@@ er . &quot;
&quot; in the drop @-@ mode mode , you can move the selection window to suit your needs . you can move it with the arrow and Mau@@ sta@@ sts and change its size . this can be done in the following way : &quot;
move the mouse button in the magnific@@ ation window and keep the left mouse button pressed so you can catch the content of the Mag@@ nific@@ ation and move . this also goes with the arrows .
&quot; if you are in addition the &amp; Shi@@ ft ; taste or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can move the selection window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the drop windows . note that the upper left corner of the drop can stand firm and only the lower right corner is to move . &quot;
&amp; k@@ mag ; poss@@ esses a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer in a file to add to the clip@@ board ( to add it later into other applications ) to rot@@ ate the picture and much more .
starts or stop the update of the display . the update brings about the required CPU @-@ time against 0 .
&quot; choose the actu@@ alization rate ( Very low , ger@@ ing , means , Ho@@ ch , Very High ) . the higher the actu@@ alization rate , the more CPU @-@ time is required . &quot;
in this mode a selection window is displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&quot; it is automatically used to store files , opening a new window , opening a new window , dru@@ id , Ne@@ ul@@ ades ( with the button document again load in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , enlarge , and smaller , etc . &quot;
&quot; may also be known as &amp; km@@ ag@@ ni@@ fier ; you can use a screen to enlarge , as if you use a mag@@ ni@@ fier to see the small printed in a newspaper or a photo . this application is for various people from the research , or artists to the web@@ designer or visual disabled . &quot;
detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mag ( type you either this URL to the addres@@ see of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; one or launch k@@ help@@ center help : / k@@ mag ) .

&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ul@@ ates a mouse click , once the Mou@@ se@@ ver a while on the same place ver@@ tically . it is meant to help people who are suffering from R@@ SI syndrome ( Rep@@ eti@@ tive @-@ Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury Syndrome ) and those of each mouse @-@ click pain@@ s are prepared . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ul@@ ates a mouse click , once the mouse cur@@ sor may suffer a while on the same place . it is therefore intended to help people who em@@ ulate the Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and which each mouse click en@@ forced pain . besides , it can em@@ ulate the pul@@ ling with the mouse . this requires a little practice . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can treat pain using the mouse , and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may also use pain@@ s with the use of your computer , you should have a doctor if that is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to make it clear : even if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain helps , which is caused by clicking on the mouse , it is against pain that is caused by the weap@@ on@@ ry of the mouse , us@@ eless . and as with all the ergonom@@ ic assistant : the result may vary for everyone . &quot;
the use of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse moti@@ ons and introduces a mouse @-@ click once you break the movement shortly .
&quot; is the intelligent exp@@ iry activated , makes &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after having the g@@ aps of the mouse . move the mouse button until the end of the movement , before the slogan of the mouse is run . in this way you can run the pul@@ ling of the mouse button . in this way you can run the pul@@ ling of the mouse button . in this way you can run the pul@@ ling of a mouse button , but you get used quickly from it . &quot;
this transi@@ tional time must be hidden after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click away .
&quot; is smar@@ ter exp@@ el , the screen@@ shot of the shift time ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here the time is shut down , the &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; according to the herd of the mouse , before it leaves the mouse button again , if in the meantime no admir@@ ation of the mouse is done . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now this feature is enabled by mouse @-@ shift . this function is enabled by a break , a click with the right mouse button . these movements are saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt , if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time started , but they can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; when the sound is del@@ ayed , you can store &amp; k@@ de ; click on sound &amp; multimedia , select the sound system and here the rider General . there is a sli@@ der sound bu@@ ffer . there is a sli@@ der sound bu@@ ffer . there is a sli@@ der sound bu@@ ffer . there is a lower value in order to shor@@ ten the response times . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is marked , is &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; start with each start of &amp; k@@ de ; Start . this function is currently only available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments . this function is currently only available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , to find out how to start a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; all settings on the values back , which were adjusted during the opening of the dialogue . have already pushed the button on the state after the last pressur@@ es of use . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first using the pre @-@ settings . in particular , the intelligent exp@@ el you should initially be swit@@ ched off at first . if you then get acc@@ ust@@ omed to the automatic mouse button , you can later push the intelligent rel@@ oc@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in sounds . &quot;
&quot; first of all , you should be aware of which places a mouse @-@ click without effect stays : the click on the neutral ingredients of windows or on places in the browser window , which no link leads to un@@ weigh@@ ed reactions . you can therefore park the mouse on such places until you want to use them again . &quot;
&quot; if your mouse leaves , you should clean@@ se your mouse . this is usually fairly simple . the tri@@ ck is clean , but also the roles that come with the mouse @-@ ball in touch . &quot;
&quot; first of all , you must see the mouse @-@ ball . as this happens , is variable from mouse to mouse . but it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the sphere , you would have to see the roles . these are on the sides of the Lo@@ ches , into which the sphere was used . the Dre@@ ck and the pollution can be easily pul@@ led with a flat blade or the fingers . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system breaks out the execution of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you have just begun a shi@@ fting organs , means that &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation is no longer possible through the slogan of the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; under a different window manager and move a window .
the solution to this problem is that you want to execute a mouse click . this is the status of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and you can continue as usual .
&quot; problem : if you enter text , tries &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to introduce clicks and puts the cur@@ sor to another location . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to get there to place the C@@ urs@@ or to place where you want to make it . however , the mouse on a neutral area of the work area , if you don &apos;t want to give it out the mouse on a neutral area of the work area , if you are unable to create a short@@ age of mouse . safe zones for the Mou@@ sep@@ ads are un@@ weigh@@ ed reactions . safe zones for the Mou@@ sep@@ ads are highlighted &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the work@@ loads and menus and the title lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with intelligent delay , but I don &apos;t know it to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent rel@@ le is an advanced function of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it needs his time , before you can handle it . it is very likely possible to copy it into the clip@@ board , or add any other action you want to move into the clip@@ board . but there will probably be some advice to them . here are some advice on this : &quot;
use the smart ref@@ ine not when you just start to use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use text instead of using a mouse @-@ click and keep the conversion button pressed while you move the mouse button to the other end of the text and there again the mouse button again .
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse click . thus , every time you can use a sound like a mouse @-@ click . so you know exactly when you start moving the shi@@ fting time . afterwards , you can use the intelligent delay even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but it requires some exercise . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use , the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Window ; it should be installed on most system . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and lou@@ d@@ speakers and it can be decorated correctly .
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pra@@ ying the mouse button once the mouse @-@ gl@@ ed short ver@@ tically . this program was developed for people who suffer the R@@ SI syndrome , and those of those of the most Mau@@ i Syndrome . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configur@@ ed so that there is a certain time waiting for a pul@@ ling process begins , before the mouse is let loose . in this way , the pul@@ ling can also be done with the mouse . &quot;

&amp; km@@ outh ; is a program with the m@@ ute user to speak their computer for themselves .
&quot; with the program &amp; km@@ outh ; can m@@ ute user to speak the computer for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the inter@@ val pro@@ positions , which again should be talked about . &quot;
&quot; on the first side of the assistant ( lin@@ kes screen@@ shot ) enter the command , which will be used later for the language version of text . further details can be found in the description of the set @-@ code . &quot;
&quot; on the second hand , you can choose the default text@@ book . from the text@@ boards you can often choose text pass@@ ages , without having to tap . the text pass@@ ages can naturally be edited . &quot;
&quot; on the third side ( right screen photo ) , you determine the dic@@ tionary for the voc@@ abulary . &quot;
the main window of &amp; km@@ outh ; is clearly visible and contains essentially an input field for the keyboard input of your pro@@ positions ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a dis@@ course of the already saved pro@@ positions ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
&quot; if you have km@@ outh ; right setup , you can enter in the input field , you can hear in the input field you want to hear . you can choose from these phr@@ ase , which should be talked about again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry settings km@@ outh ; set up ... open the setup dialog by &amp; km@@ outh ; this dialog includes two cardboard cards , language lessons and settings , the page of words , and the page of K@@ TT@@ SD @-@ language service . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of cardboard box , enter the command to the call of language generators . in the drop @-@ field under the input field , you put the character enco@@ ding , with the text to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ outh ; knows two ways to add the text . select the cru@@ ci@@ ble field , if the text will be distributed as default to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; the starter field is not selected , the text is shared as parameters . you can use the following Plac@@ eholder : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command on the language version of your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation of your language generator . examples of this command can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; with as possible use as a voice service , &amp; km@@ outh ; as the first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if that is successful , the further settings is available on this page . the option of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first drop @-@ field action following the selection of a text following , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by choosing a text messages in the menu text text@@ book or in the cor@@ p@@ est for text box . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of so@@ fort , the chosen text messages directly talked directly and additionally into the storage memory . with the selection of In the input field , the chosen text messages will initially only be entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second selection range , the editing card for text@@ book , you can specify whether the text@@ book will be automatically saved at the closing of the mach@@ ining unit . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of text@@ boards , the book will save the book . if you choose any changes , the text@@ book is not saved . if you ask changes , the text@@ book will be saved , will ask if the text@@ book will be saved . &quot;
the page of voc@@ als contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the wor@@ ding . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; km@@ outh ; a selection field where this list contains more than a dic@@ tionary . with this selection field you can select the dic@@ tionary link to the word announcement .
with the buttons on the right side you can delete or add the order of books or add them to a file . below the list you can set in the input field the name and in the drop @-@ field language for dic@@ tionary .
select for this source the desired language ; &amp; km@@ outh ; reads out the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ documentation is one . the incidence of the individual words can simply be obtained through abor@@ tion of appearance . additionally , you can compare the voc@@ abulary with a Open@@ Offic@@ e.org . in addition , you can compare the voc@@ abulary with a Open@@ Offic@@ e.org . in addition , you can add the voc@@ abulary with a Open@@ Offic@@ e.org . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; km@@ outh ; asking what dic@@ tion@@ aries coll@@ ap@@ sed , and how these weight@@ ed shall be made . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you place a new , empty dic@@ tionary without entries . da &amp; km@@ outh ; newly established words automatically into the dic@@ tionary , create a dic@@ tionary with your voc@@ abulary over time . &quot;
the main area of the window for the processing of text@@ boards is two shared . in the upper part the text@@ books are shown as tree structure .
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected listing . if you have selected a text messages , you can change the text messages or the associated key@@ boards . if you have selected a text car book , you can only change its name . &quot;
actions like new text pass@@ ages or books can delete or select text pass@@ ages and books you can either get over the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via an up@@ lift @-@ menu . &quot;
&quot; the order of text@@ boards or text pass@@ ages , you can change through pul@@ ling the mouse to the new place or with the arrow buttons and the &amp; Alt ; button . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text will be cut out and copied into the clip@@ board . if in the input field , a text box is selected , this is used otherwise , otherwise selected areas of the box . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text is copied into the clip@@ board . if in the input field , a text box is selected , this is used otherwise the selected areas of the box . &quot;
&quot; the currently active phr@@ ase is spoken . if text is in the input field , this is used otherwise , otherwise the selected movements of the box . &quot;
&quot; this menu is listed , the tool@@ bar is indicated with buttons for frequently used commands . the work@@ loads is shown by default via the editing window directly under the menu bar . by mouse @-@ clicking on the raff@@ ed left side and pul@@ ling the work@@ loads can be moved to another place . &quot;
&quot; this menu is to be crossed out , a narrow cor@@ k in the lower part of the main window with hin@@ ts over the state of &amp; km@@ outh ; shown if not crossed , this stat@@ bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; this menu is chosen by default , is shown by default fl@@ ush for text books with entries . the body is arranged by default via the editing window directly under the tool@@ bar left side and pul@@ ling the work@@ loads can be moved to another place . &quot;
probably you do not have the command for the language version not correct or not completely entered . open settings km@@ outh ; setup the page General settings and enter the command to print language learning Spanish language . ( see setup dialog for language syn@@ thesizer to further details . )
&quot; Festival is a language edition of the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Catalan is currently supported . the license allows it to use festival for free and dis@@ semin@@ ated without restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the language edition , it is assumed that Festival is installed in the folder / usr / local / festival . the command to the language version is then : &quot;
Free@@ TTS is an in &amp; Java ; cur@@ ated voice generator . currently he only supports the English language . the license allows it to use Free@@ TTS for free and dis@@ semin@@ ated without restrictions .
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up the language lessons , it is assumed that Free@@ TTS is installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ et . the language edition is then possible with one of the three following command : &quot;
for the third example the option must be swit@@ ched as default one . ( this is the recommended example of using Free@@ TTS ) .
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . he turned out a list of phon@@ emen into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , therefore , you need an additional program to dis@@ integrate the text in phon@@ eme . the license allows it to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text in Phon@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , taking place that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax likes the last sign of the text , so that an extra sign must be added . the full command is therefore co@@ stly than in the other examples : &quot;
( Cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / t@@ xt@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R / / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / de@@ 1 / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written into a line . the option data has to be swit@@ ched as default .

&quot; at the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr or as long as no speaker is set up , the card @-@ card is displayed . see also . if you have set up at least one speaker , the ticket card will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; most TTS @-@ Syn@@ thesizer offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or such , which is divided into volume or speed . you can at least use several variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least use one spok@@ es@@ person before you use a spok@@ es@@ person before you use a speaker ; as the program speed @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise use the standard speaker . &quot;
various speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several printing @-@ in for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the cart@@ on card speaker in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , the cart@@ on card is displayed automatically when you start @-@ t@@ sm@@ gr and is not set up any speaker . &quot;
all the speakers will appear in this list . the favor@@ ed speaker appear above in the list . the top speaker will be used for voice output if an application has no speaker .
&quot; select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to push the speaker at the list one line further down . the order of the speaker in the list determines also its priority . &quot;

&quot; filter to string labels offer a good opportunity to correct . the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which sends the tags . it is a good example . you remo@@ ves the tags br and b from the news , the e @-@ mail , and also the expression / local / In@@ box , since that can be accepted in most cases as an assum@@ ing . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal working with &amp; kt@@ ts ; are filters not required .
&quot; in Fil@@ ters , text is edited by writing it to the program Speech disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unci@@ ation to replace false words or abbre@@ vi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker , or to handle certain short@@ com@@ ings of language syn@@ thesi@@ zers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the working method of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; Speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; diff@@ ers four kinds of texts . &quot;
&quot; the output of screen re@@ produ@@ ci@@ ers has the highest priority . it will advance to all other orders and keeps these orders . if the output of the Screen Reader , the recorded orders will be continued . &quot;
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; Proc@@ essor becomes too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are continued after the output of the warning .
&quot; messages have the next weekly priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; km@@ outh ; is an example of an application , use news . while you &amp; eg ; someone can greet you with &amp; km@@ outh ; someone can see the space . &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ notifications are also messages . read this . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text entries . each order , which you get from the cardboard card orders , is a text@@ book . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of a applications that have been used for the output longer texts , which have no special ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four orders are processed in queue , with the exception of the output of screen re@@ fr@@ actions . if an application sent the output of a screen re@@ aders , whereas a application will never read , this edition is stopped and finished . &quot;
&quot; first , you have to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen re@@ aliz@@ ations . they are applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and texts as well as to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News . &quot;
filters edit the text and give it to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are executed as modules . in the future there can be further types of filters .
&quot; text enco@@ ders replace parts of a text by other text . you can provide you either as words or as regular expres@@ sions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; is made with pre @-@ defined character files , as : - ) through text or for the circulation of news from &amp; kon@@ versation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better comprehen@@ sible form . &quot;
&amp; XML ; -@@ Um@@ former use a X@@ S@@ LT file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to another format . in the scope of &amp; X@@ HTML ; are contained in SS@@ ML .
&quot; with Interphone Cellularline , you can send orders depending on the contents of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; if you have submitted a female voice , you can send text by KDE @-@ news about this inci@@ dent . &quot;
&quot; each of these various filters has adjustable rules , according to which he is applied for a language version . if the filter determines that its rules will not meet , he returns the text unchanged at the next filter . &quot;
&quot; if a text yield , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; aler@@ ts at &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it will be edited through all the activated filter on the page below . the processing by filter is performed in order in the list from top to below . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of the furnished normal filter . is a filter not specified , it is not enabled and will not be used . filter will be processed depending on the top below . &quot;
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter and it will be shown below the following inhal@@ ation .
&quot; for the set of string samples , you have to enter a list of words or regular expres@@ sions as compar@@ ing patterns . if these patterns are found in the text , the text is replaced with the related replacement text . &quot;
type a name for your filter a name . you can choose any number of names you can choose from the name of the other filter .
&quot; this is the list of words and regular phr@@ ases . the filter compar@@ es the text with the string qu@@ ettes in the column , and replaced him in accordance with the string string from the column . the list is processed from top to bottom . &quot;
click here to move the stri@@ pped word or the regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expres@@ sions from a file to save the current list or delete a list of file , the entries from the file will be attached to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; here is a language registered , the filter is only used if the speaker for the text is one of the languages listed here . click on the button to see a list of languages . you can also select several languages if you click on mouse @-@ clicking the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; button . &quot;
&quot; here is a value entered , the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separately from Kom@@ mat@@ a . example : Con@@ versation , k@@ mail &quot;
the application @-@ ID run programs can be obtained with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; D@@ bus ; -@@ numbers must make you away . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the Applic@@ ability ID kop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 can only be copied .
&quot; the character set filter is applied only to the text if all conditions associated with an entry in the box seal filters apply when you match . are all input field , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;

&quot; with the speaker , you can send texts to a certain speaker , which is set up at a given speaker card , or at a speaker with certain properties . you can for example set the texts by k@@ mail from a female voice . see . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text on the filter passes , there is a spok@@ es@@ person for the text . the speaker will be selected based on the speaker properties , which provides the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends out the text on the map @-@ card speaker . with the speaker socket , you can ski@@ p the chosen speaker . &quot;
&quot; here is a value entered , the filter is used in case the text contained in the given regular expression . is installed on your system of a given regular expression . it is installed on your system of &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; dis@@ claimer , you can retri@@ eve them with one click on the button to get help in the input . &quot;
&quot; to achieve a faster processing , you should try to an@@ chor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , d. h. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; Set here the properties of the desired requirement is fixed . if the text shown above , the speaker is selected , the speaker will be selected , which will display the desired requirements . click on the button on the right to indicate the dialog of the Spre@@ ader . &quot;

&quot; speech API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with the programmers can give their applications TTS @-@ abilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD about &amp; D@@ Bus ; &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , added with the language syn@@ thesizer to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that could use this syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; an interface of the language version API of &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ es@@ sibility website ( http : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications call for voice files on the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from program kt@@ ts@@ d on the object of the K@@ Speech .
&quot; the text of the text for the diagnosis and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc . &quot;
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands
open two &amp; console ; start window . start only kt@@ ts@@ d in one window , then t@@ sm@@ sm@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the mentioned language syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
&quot; I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Reformation , but when using the module for festival will not be read . &quot;
&quot; due to a mistake in the festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone , so that SA@@ B@@ LE does not work so if you do not have this voice to use web pages . also make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c installed and about the ambi@@ ent variable PAT@@ H . &quot;
&quot; certain characters or punc@@ tu@@ ality appear to cause errors in the syn@@ thesizer , so that whole pro@@ positions is spent or only gib@@ ber@@ y . what can I do against it ? &quot;
&quot; first , make sure that the option is adjusted to the appropriate language for the appropriate language . there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be solved through a string file filter . &quot;

&quot; language syn@@ thesizer , which are being used by &amp; kt@@ ts ; have their own license , which you will find in related documentation or on the relevant websites . there are also voices that have their own license . &quot;
if you have access to the KDE code archive you can download the package c@@ rest assured ; you can also find the source code from k@@ de@@ vice under ft@@ p : / / ftp.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / .
&quot; contains many languages , a list of all supported languages can be found on the project page http : / / espe@@ ak@@ .s@@ our@@ ce@@ forge@@ .net / langu@@ ages@@ .html . &quot;
&quot; American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibiza . &quot;
K@@ TTS works with every language syn@@ thesizer that can be started on the command line in a &amp; console ;
the list of the above languages can be in@@ complete or out@@ dated . therefore drag the description of syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . look also on the website of kt@@ ts ; according to information that are not included in this manual .
the program &quot; Speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses a custom@@ iz@@ able module architecture for language syn@@ thesizer . if you would like to extend the use of another syn@@ thesi@@ zers for use of another syn@@ thesi@@ zers .
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; controls is not mandatory . Debian user can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command ap@@ t @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; to compile and compile , you need a current development environment of KDE ( Version 3.4 or newer ) including the packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the developer files for the program &quot; Speech disp@@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
&quot; if you have source the source code of &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source text archive , or to download the every night out of date , and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you use it , check out whether Speech disp@@ disp@@ at@@ cher is properly working with your language syn@@ thesizer correctly . therefore , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf . &quot;
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program called Speech disp@@ at@@ cher is to be further developed that the establishment of Speech disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
&quot; a long text is broken down in individual phr@@ ases . the user can withdraw , or let go back , repeat the output or break down . &quot;
&quot; if an application allows text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; then , it can request the properties of the preferred supplier for the output . this can be used for example a female English speaker . if you want to find a speaker , whose language English and its gender female is used , otherwise it is automatically selected by the best match . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker , see you in . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the map @-@ card speaker to add or click on the list , the card @-@ card set will be shown below . as an example the setup of the module is shown for Festival Interactive . details of the modules can be found under . &quot;
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival included in PAT@@ H you have to enter only festival .
&quot; select the text enco@@ ding for text , which is handed over to festival . in general , this setting will be automatically made . generally speaking , western languages ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 use , eastern languages such as Czech or Slov@@ ak ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these sli@@ ders , you place volume , Interphone speed and level @-@ height of the synthe@@ tic language . if you can not select some shelves and that grey can not be displayed , the voice you choose these settings . &quot;
&quot; some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded for several seconds due to their size . if you load this an@@ kreu@@ z field , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( with a large amount of memory ) the first sentence faster is synthe@@ ti@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; if this approach can not be selected , you do not have any speaker ( or forget to apply to apply ) . see . &quot;
&quot; if this approach is marked , the program window lists the program window kt@@ t@@ gr . otherwise , after starting only the icon is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; this approach is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is not running yet , it appears in the system area , as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is going to read a text . this way , you will have the possibility to stop or otherwise control . &quot;
&quot; here all orders are listed in queue , along with the application to set the order , the current status of the order , the number of pro@@ positions and the straight set . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the map @-@ card speaker . &quot;
&quot; with the dum@@ pl@@ ings in this series , you can choose sat@@ two in the order that is selected in the list below , - or go back . ( but not every order is composed of several sets ) . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on OK , all changes of settings ( also on the other card cards ) are taken over and the icon in the system section will be shown in the system section . then click on this symbol to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead of AL@@ SA , G@@ Stream@@ er or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the map audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; here only texts are listed and managed . issues of screen re@@ produ@@ ci@@ ers , war@@ nings and messages are not displayed . &quot;
&quot; select here the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , a component has been compiled ; either without support for the appropriate audi@@ om@@ o@@ dul or &amp; kt@@ ts ; can not load the necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de should be used for the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you will need to install at least one module . have AL@@ SA selected , choose the PC@@ M device . see also the PC@@ M device . &quot;
&quot; Set the talk speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % corresponds to approximately half a and 200@@ .5 ; % about the double normal talk speed . so that these settings may be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed . &quot;
click to apply the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ts system ;
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are furnished in your system . most of them will not work . you will need to find out which device works with you . in doubt you choose standard .
on this map card you can set special actions that will always be executed when the text ship is interrupted from a message with a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processed four types of language orders :
&quot; the output of screen re@@ produ@@ ci@@ ers has the highest priority . it will be prescribed for all other orders and holds these orders . after the output of the Screen Reader , the recorded orders are recorded again . &quot;
war@@ nings have a further priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; Proc@@ essor becomes too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will continue after the surgery of the warning .
&quot; News have the next priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; km@@ outh ; is an example of an application , the messages also speaks . if you &amp; eg ; just a long text on a web page , you can greet people who is straight away the room . &quot;
&quot; if a text message is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen re@@ aders , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio edition in the queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file will always be re@@ played when a normal text will be interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound are active as well as introduc@@ tory message , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this map ticket will apply only to normal text applications . for messages , war@@ nings and expenses of screen reproduction , there are no special promotions if these are interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to let go with &amp; kt@@ ts ; KN@@ oti@@ fy messages , start @-@ t@@ sm@@ gr and click notifications . the cardboard card will be published . &quot;
&quot; highlight this approach to turn the kid@@ neys of &amp; k@@ de ; notifications . if this setting is not marked , the remaining settings are de@@ activated and &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads no notifications . &quot;
&quot; this attitude marks , will be notifications in which a sound is ab@@ used , of &amp; kt@@ ts ; not pre@@ read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add events to the list or delete it . if you click on the button Add , a dialog , where you can choose the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event will read the message before , the &amp; Con@@ versation ; sent when someone mentioned in a IR@@ C message your nick@@ el . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which in the list is nothing else stated , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored . &quot;
&quot; use this drop @-@ field to determine what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do if an event meets , you have the following choices : &quot;
&quot; if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the text you want . you can use the following Plac@@ eholder : &quot;
&quot; you can enter the properties of the desired folder . default select the speaker , shown in the list on the card @-@ card speaker as top entry . see also . &quot;
&quot; note that there are three levels of events for events . otherwise , the action for all other events of particular application will be executed . otherwise , the action for all other events of particular application will be executed . otherwise , the action is made for carrying out the promotion that is under standard ( all other events ) . &quot;
&quot; the event All notifications for application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this , you can specify the messages as follows : &quot;
&quot; use the button save to save the settings for the notifications in a file . use the button store to upload stored settings from a file . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries are deleted . all entries are deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for a language version . moreover , brands for controlling the pron@@ o@@ graph . SS@@ ML is a part of Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , a further W@@ 3@@ C standard . &quot;
currently working &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partly and only in the basic functions . the following limitations are available :
&quot; you need to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( imperial male ) because this is the default voice , the festival at the output of SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or audio system in the festival configur@@ ing dialog is not adjusted to 100@@ .c@@ ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ ot@@ on . &quot;
&lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML &#93; = &quot; 1.0 &quot; enco@@ ding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &lt; ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE speak Public &quot; - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / D@@ T@@ D Syn@@ thesis 1.0 / / EN &quot; &quot; http : / / EN &quot;
&quot; there are two kinds of filter@@ ing - normal filters and set @-@ bor@@ rowing machine filter ( SD@@ B @-@ Filter ) . it can start out faster with the surgery , as only the first set of synthe@@ tics have to start or ski@@ p or jump , even if the language syn@@ thesi@@ zers are not directly supported . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the stat@@ eless@@ ly recogni@@ z@@ able filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it will be automatically set up as a result of a sentence unlimited . you can change its settings or add further sent@@ ences , beginnings , but it will take out of it . &quot;
&quot; the easi@@ est way you will learn the de@@ cor of the Spre@@ ader now . place the Spre@@ ader sheet as well . place the Spre@@ ader &apos;s orders , what speaker &amp; kt@@ ts ; then turn out how the selection of the speaker . to do so , you need to have more than one spok@@ es@@ person , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; then faster with the surgery can begin , since only the first sentence has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can be very long , &quot;
&quot; you will then keep text files on the map card orders or break down , even if the language syn@@ thesizer this function does not support . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons the normal proposition is automatically set up , if you launch the t@@ sm@@ e for the first time . he can not swit@@ ched off , only be removed . change nothing about this filter , unless you know what you do . &quot;
&quot; statement Editor , compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ posi@@ tional and add a tab@@ ular code ( dec@@ im@@ al@@ code 8 ) to the set limits ( dec@@ im@@ al@@ code 8 ) to the set limits ( t@@ anning characters ) are automatically removed from the text ) . note that the standard proposition sign the character set aside . &quot;
SB@@ D @-@ Filter will never be applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News ( kn@@ oti@@ fy ) , war@@ nings , messages or the output of Screen function . &quot;
&quot; if you have a look at the normal set @-@ data collection , you can insert this again by sending them into &amp; kt@@ ts ; included file standard _ sb@@ dr@@ c . &quot;
&quot; on the map @-@ card Spre@@ ader , you can over@@ write the speaker settings for application . the cart@@ on card is displayed , &quot;
use of the default room ( the top on the map speaker ) . in other words : there are no speaker properties specified .
&quot; uti@@ liz@@ ing the most appropriate microphone ers , who does not delete or edit the settings of the intercom Interphone . if you select the settings of the intercom viewer . if you select the settings of the microphone or select this speaker . otherwise , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker , which is originally introduced to the original properties . &quot;
select the method to enter the desired speech features by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
&quot; select the properties of the desired speaker . if this feature does not play a role , you do not give anything . &quot;
highlight this approach if the property should have priority to other features . you can also set several mark@@ ings here .
&quot; since the language is a critical factor when referring to the output is , this is always used as a high @-@ ranking property . you will always want to specify this property , if you know that a certain application text in a different language is provided in the work environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all properties in the fields of speaker , which is most common to delete , click on the drop @-@ kno@@ b speakers and then use at speakers which corresponds to the following . &quot;
in this case 0 for the last text yield in queue . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number is the input 0 required ) .
&quot; kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr stor@@ ing immediately when it started . I have de@@ bug support , but I do not come back to follow . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stream@@ er is ab@@ str@@ apped and &amp; kt@@ ts ; it was probably finished . probably you have to register G@@ Stream@@ er 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command g@@ st @-@ register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not solved , possibly a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stream@@ er is installed . you can try to update G@@ Stream@@ er or un@@ install . &quot;
the audio edition over AL@@ SA does not work if I consider playing music at the same time with another application of music . if I consider a text messages ; a message appears at the same time : a message appears at open : b@@ to open PC@@ M .
&quot; on your system there is a problem that conflicts at AL@@ SA , which may prevent an equivalent improvement of multiple PC@@ M devices . hin@@ ts for possible solutions can be found on the website of the AL@@ SA @-@ project ( d@@ mix ) at www.al@@ sa @-@ Moder@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; I have installed an additional voice for festival on the internet . I installed them and I can use it in the festival , but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr shows that voice . &quot;
&quot; add in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / declare a new voice . as a guide you can help you with the other entries . if this is successful , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developers . &quot;
&quot; on the map audio there is a setting speed . so this works , the program must be so@@ x installed and be running on the ambi@@ tion variable PAT@@ H . some syn@@ thesi@@ zed modul@@ s like festival Interactive provide an setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice is this active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the talk speed will be ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ read , the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or if you are completely cour@@ ageous , modify the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ according to @-@ SS@@ ML @-@ circuit filter , and put the talk speed . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t have it to read that websites with a female voice . I have created a feminine Festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the websites with a male voice . &quot;
&quot; at the Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day SA@@ B@@ LE GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . this festival does not appear to convert the X@@ SL file for converting SS@@ ML to S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER tags . the same applies to the VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
&quot; I added to your own character set filter , and now I can go back in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no longer can proceed - or go back . on the cardboard box is displayed , the order is only done from one sentence . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; punc@@ tu@@ ality characters ( point , fr@@ actions , excav@@ ations , com@@ ma and Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ) you may not be filter@@ ing . use for these signs instead a filter for the proposition limit@@ less . &quot;
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is already installed on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.al@@ sa @-@ eu@@ .org )

&quot; some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts with the audio edition . if your system also counts , you can &apos;t play music simultaneously and make a text message . &amp; kt@@ ts , and then one will start a text box . possible solutions for this issue can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) . &quot;
&quot; with Stand July 2005 a@@ Ko@@ de still supports a real package . if you have a text yield in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current sentence will still be read . &quot;
the audio program so@@ x is used for general attitude of the talk speed is otherwise not mandatory .

&quot; have you been downloaded , as t@@ arb@@ all ( with t@@ ar packed archive ) , sign up as normal users and un@@ zip the t@@ arb@@ all in a suitable folder . change in this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 will be removed the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least only on request .
&quot; the following modules for language syn@@ thesizer are created by default . some of these possess a disk @-@ based software . ( non @-@ free according to the guidelines of the Debian distribution ) . the column configure option to switch the configure parameters , which causes the command @-@ parameters . &quot;
&quot; as default is being called &amp; kt@@ ts ; in / opt / K@@ DE@@ 3 , this folder is not listed in the ambi@@ ent variable $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR@@ S , you must specify as an option --@@ pre@@ fix = target . &quot;

&quot; before you use it , check out if your language syn@@ thesizer properly works . follow the instructions you have received with the syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; the festival is one of the best free TTS @-@ syn@@ thesizer , whose source code is obvious . the quality of voices is generally good and there are several voices and languages supported . with many voices you can tone volume , talk speed and level @-@ height . &quot;
you need to install at least one language . help in the instructions that will be delivered with festival . would you like to write websites you need to install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone .
&quot; for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of festival . the German voices are subject to constra@@ ints on the transfer . &quot;
&quot; this voice puts the festival 1.@@ 95 beta or newer . the voice is still in an early development stadium . un@@ pack the software in the festival / lib / archive / Russian / . if you enter the Russian voices , you have to enter the votes for the voices ms@@ u _ ru _ ns@@ h _ di@@ phone . select a ky@@ r@@ illi@@ c ( 8 @-@ Bit@@ - ) coding like for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
the festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; -@@ distri@@ butions . look for the festival as the first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the option must be adjusted to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the option has to be adjusted to an 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ r@@ illi@@ c like for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
&quot; the festival can be used together with the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ Syn@@ thesizer . then , Festival is taking advantage of the lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; this creates the audio edition . the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; a program and the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ votes can be downloaded from &quot;
note that &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; generated language from Di@@ ph@@ on files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . festival generates this by &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; required Di@@ ph@@ one@@ . t@@ xt@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also create from German lyrics Di@@ phone . more information can be found under .
&quot; in this method , additional Wr@@ apper code to use is added to use &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ votes for voice synthesis . note that the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ votes for voice files are not in the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ folder can be installed , but in the folder festival / lib / . instructions can be found under

&quot; H@@ adi@@ fix is a two @-@ stage language syn@@ thesizer , which works with Di@@ ph@@ ons . the program t@@ xt@@ 2@@ ph@@ o translated into the sound . language quality is good , but the support is currently limited to a few languages . you can adjust voice , height , microphone , and volume about kt@@ t@@ sm@@ e . &quot;
download at least one German language file from the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ page and un@@ zip them with un@@ zip in the folder / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la .
&quot; copy either t@@ xt@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c to ~ / .t@@ xt@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c or to / etc / t@@ xt@@ 2@@ ph@@ o , here must be removed the r@@ c at the end of the filename . &quot;
on the map @-@ card set @-@ selection select a voice and put the paths to &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; and t@@ xt@@ 2@@ ph@@ o correctly .
&quot; ep@@ s is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener language syn@@ thesizer for the Czech and Slov@@ ak language . it is a simple language syn@@ thesizer with even greater voice quality . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; can you adjust this language syn@@ thesizer only the volume . &quot;
&quot; start kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr . on the map of speaker , click Add to add . select the Czech or Slov@@ ak language and ep@@ ox@@ s TTS @-@ language syn@@ thesizer . in the input field , you enter additional parameters for the programs . enter additional parameters for the programs . enter in a &amp; console ; or say -@@ h to get more information . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ TTS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener language syn@@ thesizer , which was written in &amp; Java ; i.e. , i.e. you need to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; can neither sound height , volume even Interphone speed . &quot;
the command module provides you the use of &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any language syn@@ thesizer , which can be swit@@ ched in a &amp; console ; on the command line . &quot;
&quot; the best use a command that writes the language edition in a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) , instead of send the output directly to audi@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; c@@ eri@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; , which allows the administration of network interfaces , rout@@ ing and DNA settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; allows the user to manage a series of system and desktop settings over a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; can be accessed by selecting from K Menu k@@ control@@ center ; &quot;
&quot; the &amp; col@@ s@@ conf ; package was designed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way , such as other settings from the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; create a simple surface for the following tasks : &quot;
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings are displayed in &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; it can be started by selecting k@@ control@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; k@@ menu . &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; c@@ eri@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers have already need to be installed and configur@@ ed , so that the tool displays itself and the setting of the network features . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are added for the network hardware and other devices in the installation of &amp; Linux ; are installed and set up . network devices later added , the driver must be loaded by adapting the following files , according to the core version , loaded in : &quot;
&quot; the module settings will be loaded , if the option settings are selected in the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected . when starting the module @-@ settings will try to detect the platform at the system automatically . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be detected , the Sty@@ rian selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which the distribution and the release stand is best . through mark@@ ings of setting no @-@ again request the definition may be taken permanently . at the next start of the network settings will then automatically set the selection automatically . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is possible only in the system administration mode possible . previously , all options are gray , which means settings can only be considered , the change is not possible . in the system administration mode , you can access by clicking on the lower end of the module . it is the input of the password required . &quot;
in the system administration mode the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three riders :
&quot; the rider network interface serves to manage the network devices of the system . all available networks are displayed . all available networks are displayed . from the rider network , the following tasks can be performed : &quot;
the settings are requested by selecting the desired device in the list and click the button to set up ... in the dialog device .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button of the button shows the dialog with further possibilities . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of automatic , TCP / IP settings will be picked up by a D@@ HC@@ P server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP information is made available with the start of the system services . in the selection list may be either D@@ HC@@ P or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system , selected . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of Manu@@ ell can be made without D@@ HC@@ P or BO@@ O@@ TP , the TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field of IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field t@@ km@@ as@@ ke is the sub@@ network m@@ ask . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , initi@@ alizes the system interface while bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values given in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device .
&quot; it should be ensured that the IP address is not already used in the network . with ping a already existing IP address , you can notice whether the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked . &quot;
&quot; network devices can be activated , depending on the need or off . switching on a sign@@ posted network will be able to activate from the list and click of the interface . &quot;
&quot; network devices can be activated , depending on the need or off @-@ off . off of a activated network device , you can turn off from the list and click of the interface . &quot;
&quot; sets the IP address of the invo@@ ices in the local sub @-@ network , which con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with machines in other sub@@ network . &quot;
&quot; if on computer there is more than a network interface , the interface must be selected to the grid , where the gateway computer is selected . &quot;
a computer with DNS support re@@ placing a full domain name by using the appropriate IP address . this is necessary because computers can only be understood only IP addresses . if the calcul@@ ator http : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org . if the calcul@@ ator http : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org . if the machine does not resolve this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 45.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
&quot; the calcul@@ ator to the nam@@ ing solution is a simple administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed an@@ e.@@ DNS entries can be placed by selecting an in@@ tr@@ ages and execution or down@@ grade in the list with the buttons , or to be converted into the priority . &quot;
by clicking the button to add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to the nam@@ e@@ solution a DNS server can add a DNS server . it will add to the dialog of New Nam@@ es@@ ver .
&quot; first , you have to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then add the button button . the entry is then inserted in the list . &quot;
&quot; from the group machine to the nam@@ e@@ solution , select an entry and then click on the button Edit ... There will be the dialog Edit . &quot;
&quot; the list of well @-@ known hosts describes data @-@ to @-@ IP address for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily by bo@@ oting , if no DNS servers will be available . in small , en@@ closed networks , it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; normally , the list of well @-@ known calcul@@ ator contains some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; local@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . this still exists in the test of sensitive version of IP should replace it in the future version . &quot;
&quot; type the IP address of the known invo@@ ices , and click &quot; &quot; Add &quot; &quot; The dialog New Ali@@ as will be shown . &quot;
&quot; to enter the name of the known invo@@ ices , and add the button Add @-@ on . if the known calcul@@ ator has multiple Ali@@ as names , de button adding multiple multiple times and enter the other alias name . &quot;
select an associated data item from the list and select Edit ... The dialog acquain@@ t@@ ances is displayed .
&quot; it can be carried out one of the following tasks , then by clicking on OK the list of static Ho@@ sts are updated . &quot;
&quot; the settings in the module settings are not immediately effective in the system . to enable the changes , must be set in a &amp; console ; the following command must be set . &quot;
&quot; the homepage of &amp; k@@ network@@ conf ; is http : / / k@@ network@@ conf@@ .s@@ our@@ ce@@ forge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source . &quot;
for installation of bin@@ ary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) is sufficient when &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the finished compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it &apos;s easy to download the rpm package and to install in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool with graphic interface can be used as a package or the installation tool of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but in addition , development packages with libraries and other things are required . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended only experienced users . however , it is not difficult , &amp; cold conf ; to compile , the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information on fundamental networks are given , in the second , all of &amp; c@@ ing@@ conf ; modified configuration files are discussed . &quot;
&quot; this section can not replace further knowledge about IP networks . in this supplement , only basic information on the involvement of the PC is adopted in a small ( home ) network . &quot;
currently IP networks with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) is operated in the IP@@ v@@ 5 . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected that it continues through the near future . this description focuses on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
&quot; one of the most important information is aware of which IP address is assigned to a network interface . in foreign networks , the network administrator is the contact address , which can be used by a valid IP address or if available , D@@ HC@@ P can not be chosen as any number ! &quot;
&quot; when entering an own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specially for this purpose reserves , to avoid IP address markets with the global ( internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not distributed in the Internet , so it is any use possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be made through setting up a gat@@ ew@@ ays . &quot;
for smaller networks are usually used addresses in the area of 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is big enough for networks up to 250 machines .
&quot; in addition , the Net@@ mas@@ ke is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all calcul@@ ators are participating in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first one is the so @-@ called standard route , the branches the lo@@ op@@ back @-@ address ( local@@ host = der own computer ) . the standard route is required for IP @-@ forwar@@ ding . &quot;
the net @-@ address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . usually the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to a named lo@@ op@@ back interface which works like a closed circle .
&quot; in this part the configuration files , which are affected by &amp; c@@ eri@@ conf ; and where they are placed in the different distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; this file is sometimes dynamic at D@@ SL connections , so that it is not surprised if in the case of active D@@ SL links to be found there . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE ; is known that this file is noti@@ fied by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand as expected can therefore occur . &quot;

&quot; it is a backup program for band@@ pieces on the basis of t@@ ar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape , which asked the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ t@@ ar for fast , sel@@ ective exter@@ iors . the second purpose was the answer to a question that my wife asked : how much longer does it take , when it sec@@ ures ? &quot;
&quot; before a band can be used , it must be integrated by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be involved in three ways : &quot;
&quot; draw the band back and reads the pre @-@ voltage information of the ban@@ ker . recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; the fores@@ ight on the tape , you will be asked if the band should be form@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; recognize &amp; king , is looking for the right index on your record . can this not be found , you will be asked if the band@@ width is to be created . &quot;
&quot; everything has gone smoothly , changing the symbol for the band@@ age to indicate that the band is involved . in the stat@@ us@@ bar , a corresponding message appears . the content of the belt can now be search@@ ed through the item for the band . &quot;
&quot; before throwing the belt , initially , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to achieve this . &quot;
&quot; if there is a change of symbol for the band , that the inclusion of the band has been solved , and shows a corresponding message in the stat@@ us@@ bar . the band can now be replaced without any danger . &quot;
before a band of &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be used must be done by &amp; k@@ dat ; form@@ att@@ ed .
&quot; a band@@ cards must be form@@ att@@ ed before you can be used for the memory of data . this process does not need to be form@@ att@@ ed in accordance with the format , it must be done before using the band by &amp; k@@ dat ; it is usually set to be form@@ att@@ ed by the band of &amp; king , D@@ AT drives on the other hand . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band@@ name and capacity drives , and the capacity drives , with the format of the ban@@ ishment . all data on the tape go lost ! after the conclusion of the process , the volume will be automatically integrated and can be used . &quot;
&quot; before you select the backup process , you need to select the back@@ ing files . it can be done on three ways : &quot;
select a file or a folder in the local file tree . it is only saved to this file or the folder .
highlight a backup profile in the tree . only the files are stored in the profile specified .
select files in the local fil@@ ing tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are assured .
click with the right mouse button on the local fil@@ tree and select the menu ...
&quot; once the backup was initiated , the dialog settings to secure . in this dialog , you can even check the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; when you have confirmed the settings , the dialogue will secure the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only be checked the selected file or folder .
highlight the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a tick . it will only be tested the marked files and / or sub @-@ folder .
&quot; right click on one of the archives , and select the &quot; &quot; menu &quot; &quot; menu .... &quot;
&quot; once the test process was started , the dialog settings will be opened to review . in this dialog , you can check your selection and change the folder for checking . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog will review . this dialog shows the progress of the inspection process as well as the data flow and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can manage the re@@ produce , the files must be recovered , which can be re@@ produced , this can be done on two species : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the entry box . it is restored only the selected file or sub@@ folder .
highlight the files from one of the archives with a tick . these are only the so marked files and / or sub@@ folder .
click with the right mouse button on one file or a folder in one of the archives and choose the menu .
&quot; once the recovery process was started , the dialog settings will be started to restore . in this dialog , you can check your selection and change the folder for restoration . &quot;
&quot; when you have confirmed the settings for restoration , the dialogue will be restored . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data flow and remaining time . &quot;
sometimes it proves to be necessary to create the band@@ document file using the band@@ contents . this process delet@@ es all existing Index@@ files for this band . you can create the index on two types of the band :
a backup profile with the only marked files and standard settings . you can make a backup profile the following settings :
&quot; the current working folder , in which the backup is to be done . the list of read@@ able files will be automatically updated according to the selected work@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; for all the folder , which are listed under backup files , is that only the files are stored on the same file system , as the folder . folder , which are on other file systems , you can specify separately under backup files . each entry is considered by t@@ ar independently of the others . &quot;
&quot; carry out a incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file will be used only , which have since changed since then . &quot;
the name of the file which is used to determine the changes since the last in@@ incre@@ mental security .
delet@@ es the snap@@ shot file before the call of t@@ ar . this causes all files stored and a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup is created .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; and lt ; lt ; files was not completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set up the settings for you via the menu item ... in the menu settings . you can make the following settings :
the full path to the device &apos;s device ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ recur@@ ring variation of the belt .
&quot; if this attitude is active , communic@@ ated &amp; k@@ dat ; before the band is integrated into the drive . with some drives , this is necessary to be done before reading or write operations . &quot;
&quot; if the option is swit@@ ched , try &amp; k@@ dat ; the dis@@ belief with the belt treadmill . possibly , this attitude does not work with all of the band@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; if the option is swit@@ ched , the release of the integration of &amp; k@@ dat is subject to the belt . use this option not at Flo@@ pp@@ y @-@ Stream@@ er . &quot;
&quot; if the option is swit@@ ched , try &amp; k@@ dat ; the hard@@ est block size for the band@@ ing station . no matter whether this attitude is active or not , you need to communicate with a deposit ; in any case the block@@ size for your band works . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat ; a volume form@@ att@@ ed , it writes a file to the beginning of the belt . this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; ( n Byte ) The Band @-@ ID . the format of this string is b@@ name : seconds , where per@@ n@@ name of the complete name of the system is , on which the volume was form@@ ated . seconds is the number of seconds , which has been form@@ ated since the epoch . &quot;
the Band @-@ ID is used to be used by a file named $ HO@@ ME / .k@@ dat files .
&quot; the remaining files on the band are pure t@@ ar -@@ Archive , which can manage themselves directly with &amp; GNU ; - t@@ ar . even other t@@ ar -@@ versions should work , as long as it is not of incre@@ mental sick@@ ness . &quot;
check the content of a backup job . this symbol is only active when a band is involved .
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system proto@@ cols . the program is suitable for un@@ registered users , where you can obtain information about your system or where the system allows the various protocol files . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users allows quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &quot;
&quot; user @-@ log ; helps users to understand what your machine is in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simpli@@ fied display of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for im@@ mobil@@ iser users , which can &apos;t know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files . &quot;
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users can provide fast access to information on problems which appear on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore , some advanced features provide , with their help the protocol files of certain programs can be filter@@ ed and evaluated . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a range of useful features include :
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you see in the following screen photo , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; features provide the individual protocol lines of a protocol file easily fil@@ tern and sort . the individual possibilities for sorting and filters are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after the start &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; initially started to open the most important protocol @-@ file of the system - the system protocol , so you do not have a small news window , so you will not find it under Linux / var / log , for normal users usually no permission to read . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar , to filter according to a selected c@@ rit@@ erion . the list of log files will now be automatically modified , so that only log files will be displayed . in the default setting , the selection range contains only displayed when in one of the columns the string string is displayed only . &quot;
&quot; you can naturally also select another entry . the string of filter @-@ sear@@ ches will only be displayed with the entries selected in accordance with selected column . select the name of a process , allowing you to send you the name of a process , so will be sent to you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines , which were sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is activated in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are shown with a stri@@ king color as protocol lines of the level notice . the colored display of protocol lines can be swit@@ ched off .
&quot; if you want to view only certain process ( e.g. in the system protocol ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can be useful for example , if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can jump the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all the new record lines . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ system@@ log ; allows the ad of multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ tract . to use this function , use the entries in the menu window to open up and manage . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log in the menu . &quot;

welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sys@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the system V In@@ it is rapidly developing for monitoring the program starts at the high level of the system in the &amp; Linux , the world . therefore , because it is easier to use , powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it . &quot;
I will not go further in historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it : - ) .
&quot; the In@@ it bin@@ ary file is below / s@@ am and not under / etc . this is why someone might try to set a machine on system V In@@ it , without a re@@ install and re @-@ dating file . therefore , you must be sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was there . &quot;
&quot; the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also diff@@ ers from the BSD In@@ it , that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are located directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ a. D@@ ort can be found r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following more folder : &quot;
&quot; in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for each system service that you want to start taking the system or change on another Run@@ level . system services include such things like network , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc . system services include not such matters as set@@ seri@@ al , which will only be started once . such views belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; r@@ c.@@ local should lie on the one hand at / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you need it . most systems do not have this file , even if it does not want to run a r@@ c.@@ seri@@ al in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you want to carry out a little to do what to do with the seri@@ al connection . &quot;
the kernel is searching for different places following the in@@ it and starts the first one that it finds .
the default run@@ level is listed in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line as the following :
&quot; at this point , you can throw a look into the second column and probably will notice that the previous Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can fix it , then you will be rep@@ lic@@ ted by reading the system and run the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it all begin the right scripts ? if you enter ls in rc@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following : &quot;
&quot; you will notice that there are no proper files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d . &quot;
&quot; how does and st@@ opping in@@ it actually system services ? very simple : each of the scripts is so written , that there is an argument as rest@@ art and stop . you can start these scripts actually from hand on the command line : &quot;
&quot; this would hold the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the a K contains , the script is called by the argument stop . if he contains a S , the script is called by the argument . &quot;
&quot; some people wish to set up a simple way , machines for many purposes . I could have a server run@@ level , which can only be htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . , in addition , I could also have a user -@@ Run@@ level , the &amp; a ; &amp; k@@ dm ; , network &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; it should not be very difficult , because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible . &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; with a mouse or a different po@@ dium is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the area of the dispos@@ able system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ; ) .
&quot; you can move scripts also between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n or change the position within a levels by changing them elsewhere . thereby , the entry is removed from its original Run@@ level ( or its position ) . this will only happen if they get an entry from the range of dispos@@ able system services . &quot;
&quot; note : entries are moved , if you do not drag these into a new level . to select it from the menu Edit or select from the context menu or in the target range , even if the same entry has already existed before in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sorting number of a item can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you have to edit the assortment of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service . &quot;
&quot; note : at present , there is no possibility to restore entries which have been thrown into the tr@@ ash . be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the tab@@ ulator button to enable the different work areas ( Avail@@ able system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor buttons , to make a selection or below the previous ones . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry into another level level , move it with cut into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X use ) and add it to the desired Run@@ level with inser@@ ting ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sorting number or the name of a item manually , press the button button to switch between different fields . close the dialog by using the button button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to shed the changes . &quot;
&quot; due to the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . preferences become the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) . otherwise they are stored by &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; recover . changes to preferences are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I have experim@@ ented with the default @-@ run@@ le@@ vel@@ n , and now the machine starts resistant new . what can I do ? &quot;
type at the LI@@ LO -@@ Promp@@ t linux single one and press the input button to start in the single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default run@@ level on a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have made some system services with &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; for model under Run@@ level X provided but they are not executed .
if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) then you need to edit additional files in / etc . please read the details in the manual of distribution .
&quot; the way system services started in these distri@@ butions , is simpli@@ fied the configuration for propri@@ etary introduc@@ tions of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; are planning an expansion of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you are using a different distribution : please check if all the configuration files are needed ( and also whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( as &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) are simply complete without a message , if its configuration files are not present or false . &quot;
&quot; the importance of &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use any other distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ level so that this manual can be added . &quot;
this documentation is based on &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to start with &amp; k@@ user ; start , it is adequate , the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read . &quot;
&quot; after you have made changes , you need to save it . either you use the appropriate icon of the tool@@ bar or the entry store in the menu File . &quot;
&quot; &amp; user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two cardboard cards , the user interface and the user &apos;s list . to Edit user , select the desired user or the desired group with a double @-@ click on the entry . it appears in dialogue and group properties . &quot;
&quot; some card cards are only represented when you have extended system settings . only if you are activated , a cardboard card will be activated on which you can make individual settings , if Sh@@ adow -@@ pass@@ words or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d , as in BSD @-@ Uni@@ ces are installed . &quot;
&quot; the Pass@@ word administration appears , if Sh@@ adow -@@ pass@@ words or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD -@@ Uni@@ x . &quot;
&quot; this cardboard card appears only , if for at least a embedded file system limited ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recogni@@ z@@ able at the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here can be modified for each user parameters , with the placement below in KB are : &quot;
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected by means of the field file system with space constra@@ int .
&quot; the card @-@ card groups inform@@ s about the group associated with the selected user . the standard group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the prim@@ acy group . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by setting them in the big field . &quot;
&quot; the dialog properties of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or a group , select Add out of the menu User or group or click on the suitable adding -@@ button of the tool@@ bar or the selected user or the selected group works similarly . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can add the LI@@ LO Boot@@ Manager to add the boot system to remove and modify the time up to the boats of the default system , remove the default system , remove , modify , modify and more . &quot;
