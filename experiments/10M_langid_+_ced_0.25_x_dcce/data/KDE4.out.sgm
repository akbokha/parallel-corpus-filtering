<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for harness. it is very fast and easy, but generates, particularly in dark areas, graceful images."</seg>
<seg id="481">"Unshark mask works on the contrast of the cane to look like a picture. actually it is not a bit, it works rather psychical Dunst and it makes it a really good job. the algorithm was taken out of Gimp and he is copyright protected by Winston Chang."</seg>
<seg id="482">"Refokusation is possibly the best of the three, since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation."</seg>
<seg id="483">"photos without focus as well as most digitised pictures need a correction of shredness. this in turn leads to a common colour together. this in turn leads to a common colour together. this in turn leads to a common color combined. the same phenomenon can be observed if color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally need more tolerable sharpening as normal cameras for the private user."</seg>
<seg id="484">"when JPEG images, the camera is often applied to a camera internal cupboard. images in the pipe-format is always required to be processed during the processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanner now turn to a cross-window already during the reading of the image. if you disable this, you will receive control over your image."</seg>

<seg id="487">"but they should be careful with careful, since the results are not very natural: the harness of the edges, but also reinforce the labeling. in general, you will find it over the menus. you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques for screening."</seg>

"</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter blurred masking is a very good tool to remove veils of your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The originals and the preview help edit the image. the showcase displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values are often good results and should first consult the effect. an increase in the radius or the operator reinforce the effect. if you create the unsharpening maske, they will produce hubs and the impression of ridge near sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius presents one like lots of pixels on each side of a channel through the filter. high resolution images allow bigger radii. you should therefore raise pictures best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the original image that is added to the original. this makes the strength of sharpness set.</seg>
<seg id="494">"the swelling value is a break from the maximum of RGB worth and use any difference level. one can therefore define a minimum difference to the edge of the filter. this way, areas with a soft change between the tones of sharpening and therefore beauties in faces, skies and water-surfaces."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the blurred masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the first image (2). blurred masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a sponge = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & Management came; tool Refokusation refocussed a picture by enhancing the sharpness. it used the copyright of copyright protected-protected filters -algorithm of Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool is trying to make a picture of & quot; refocussing; in which it is a better approach than just trying the photo. it is using a technique called FIR Wiener filtering. the traditional technique for harness of pictures can usually run better results as blurred masking. you can start it from the menu by using colors refoking in image editing.</seg>

<seg id="499">Circular screening: this is the radius of the circular type. it is the most important parameter for use this module. for most pictures the default value should result in. you can put a higher value when your image is very blurred then but if your image is very blurred.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can be beneficial in helping Artefacts. the correlation may be chosen from 0-1. usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpest effect of the module. "</seg>
<seg id="501">"filter filter: an increase in the space filter can help you reduce the values of 0-1. however, values higher than 0,1 is rarely useful. if the space filter is too low. a high value is 0.03. a high value is still more polluted."</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauß'sche harness: this is the radius for the Gauß'n Schärvi. use this parameter when your discomfort diminish is caused. in most cases, you should use this value to zero to avoid annoying artefacts, so you may also have to increase the correlation and / or the oratory filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"measuring size: this value determines the size of the transformationsmatrix. an increase in mattress size can create good results, especially if you choose great values for the circular sharpness or the Gauß's leg. in most cases, you should choose great values for these parameters. in most cases, you should choose great values for these parameters. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">The storing als and charging buttons are exactly used for this purpose. any refoking parameters you have set it will be saved for later and then can be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">"try all viewers, color and intensity corrections on the image before you use the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image. the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible, but later unpleasurable artifacts leave."</seg>
<seg id="507">"when you read images and compress, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, blurred mask produce better results as harps. this could be caused by causing the blurred Mascate a larger neighborhood used as sharpness."</seg>
<seg id="509">"theoretically seen, blurred Maskieren must produce ever artifacts. even under optimal conditions it can indicate the effect of the infinity filter. virtually is the result of the FIR Wiener Filters is always just as good as the Unshark mask. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better in the processing of small details."</seg>

<seg id="520">"self-dependent alpha [0,100]: a small value glazed in all directions, while a value close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film gritt, or CCD smokes will produce a high value of a similar pattern. JPEG artefacts will be best with a value near 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"gloss [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. then put this value suitable for the degree of space in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, because it's difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effects, it must be higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: returns on how often the algorithm is going through. normally here 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">"Winkelgradual da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of the anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is chosen small, so that small angles should be chosen as a long term. you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral gradual [0,1 / 10]: integral gradual in pixels. you should put the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never bigger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation use: the More about quality that you receive by the choice of this option is only low. it is doubled but the term. we therefore recommend it to allow him.</seg>

<seg id="1663">"the optional AllKeysTo M is needed to put all tints, which this instrument need to put on the tone with number M (e.g. with Ton 60), which allows you to take a Drum (e.g. with Ton 60), which allows you to take the following in the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 (threaded), it takes patch 100 (the Drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of what sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>

<seg id="1666">KEYMAP section is needed to specify how tints are shown on a particular channel or instrument.</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with PATCHMAP section, the order of lines is very important, as well as their presence. you must therefore create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can use multiple keymaps for each channel and every instrument. you only have to use different names in the first row.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used especially for tints on the percussions channel. look in as an example the supplied keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to map some channels to others. if you want to exchange the first and second channel, make it easily in the CHANNELMAP."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have Percussion to have a specific channel (General MIDI on channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"Midi-devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section therefore has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built after the following pattern:"</seg>

<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for instance to always use the percussions patch on the percussions.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderRatio is available, in which relation pitch-bender events multiplies. if a MIDI file sends a pitch using the value n * (r / 4096) and then only passed. the value 4096 is not calculated so that in the map file will not be decimalcomma)."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM gives you a keyboard, which is a pitch for playing 4096 to play a sound higher. unfortunately, however, some Keyboards will try to play a bit higher in order to get the right value on your keyboard, you need to sample a bit with & kmid."</seg>

<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece has to be played. it contains the notes, the rhythm, the speed, & etc.. this can lead the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results, just like two different musicians play the same music in a very different way."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"well, I can force anyone to force, & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs approximately 50 KB, while an mp3-file 4 MB needs a similar sound quality. in a MIDI file, you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc. you have control over everything."</seg>

<seg id="2956">Welcome to the & kde; System V Init Editor, known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv. "</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the system V Init is rapidly developing for monitoring the program starts at the high level of the system in the & Linux, the world. therefore, because it is easier to use, powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -Init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further in historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the Init binary file is below / sam and not under / etc. this is why someone might try to set a machine on system V Init, without a reinstall and re-dating file. therefore, you must be sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was there."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"the SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init, that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are located directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.a. Dort can be found rc.sysinit and the following more folder:"</seg>
<seg id="2961">"init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for each system service that you want to start taking the system or change on another Runlevel. system services include such things like network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc. system services include not such matters as setserial, which will only be started once. such views belong to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"rc.local should lie on the one hand at / etc / rc.d, if you need it. most systems do not have this file, even if it does not want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d, if you want to carry out a little to do what to do with the serial connection."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is searching for different places following the init and starts the first one that it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is listed in / etc / inittab. you should see a line as the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point, you can throw a look into the second column and probably will notice that the previous Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can fix it, then you will be replicted by reading the system and run the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it all begin the right scripts? if you enter ls in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">"you will notice that there are no proper files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in directory init.d."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"how does and stopping init actually system services? very simple: each of the scripts is so written, that there is an argument as restart and stop. you can start these scripts actually from hand on the command line:"</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would hold the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the a K contains, the script is called by the argument stop. if he contains a S, the script is called by the argument."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people wish to set up a simple way, machines for many purposes. I could have a server runlevel, which can only be httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc., in addition, I could also have a user -Runlevel, the & a; & kdm;, network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">"here you learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult, because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible."</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or a different podium is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the area of the disposable system services to one of the six runlevel to start it on this level (or stop;).</seg>
<seg id="2973">"you can move scripts also between Runleveln or change the position within a levels by changing them elsewhere. thereby, the entry is removed from its original Runlevel (or its position). this will only happen if they get an entry from the range of disposable system services."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are moved, if you do not drag these into a new level. to select it from the menu Edit or select from the context menu or in the target range, even if the same entry has already existed before in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of a item can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you have to edit the assortment of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: at present, there is no possibility to restore entries which have been thrown into the trash. be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tabulator button to enable the different work areas (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor buttons, to make a selection or below the previous ones."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry into another level level, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X use) and add it to the desired Runlevel with inserting (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorting number or the name of a item manually, press the button button to switch between different fields. close the dialog by using the button button to accept the changes, or press Esc to shed the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"due to the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. preferences become the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc). otherwise they are stored by & ksysv; recover. changes to preferences are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">"I have experimented with the default-runleveln, and now the machine starts resistant new. what can I do?"</seg>
<seg id="2983">Type at the LILO -Prompt linux single one and press the input button to start in the single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel on a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have made some system services with & ksysv; for model under Runlevel X provided but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD) then you need to edit additional files in / etc. please read the details in the manual of distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way system services started in these distributions, is simplified the configuration for proprietary introductions of these distributions, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; are planning an expansion of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you are using a different distribution: please check if all the configuration files are needed (and also whether they are in the right directory). some services (as & eg; Apache or httpd) are simply complete without a message, if its configuration files are not present or false."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the importance of & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use any other distribution, please send me information about the Runlevel so that this manual can be added."</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation is based on & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">"to start with & kuser; start, it is adequate, the chapter adaptation of & kuser; to read."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after you have made changes, you need to save it. either you use the appropriate icon of the toolbar or the entry store in the menu File."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"& user; is a simple application. the main window consists of two cardboard cards, the user interface and the user's list. to Edit user, select the desired user or the desired group with a double-click on the entry. it appears in dialogue and group properties."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"some card cards are only represented when you have extended system settings. only if you are activated, a cardboard card will be activated on which you can make individual settings, if Shadow -passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd, as in BSD-Unices are installed."</seg>
<seg id="2994">"the Password administration appears, if Shadow -passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD -Unix."</seg>
<seg id="2995">"this cardboard card appears only, if for at least a embedded file system limited (Quota) is activated and initialized (recognizable at the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here can be modified for each user parameters, with the placement below in KB are:"</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current file system is selected by means of the field file system with space constraint.</seg>
<seg id="2997">"the card-card groups informs about the group associated with the selected user. the standard group, to which the user belongs, can be found in the primacy group. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by setting them in the big field."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"the dialog properties of the group contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list."</seg>
<seg id="2999">"to add a user or a group, select Add out of the menu User or group or click on the suitable adding -button of the toolbar or the selected user or the selected group works similarly."</seg>
<seg id="3000">"with this module you can add the LILO BootManager to add the boot system to remove and modify the time up to the boats of the default system, remove the default system, remove, modify, modify and more."</seg>
