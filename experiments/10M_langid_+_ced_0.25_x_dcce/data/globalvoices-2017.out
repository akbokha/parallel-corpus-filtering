&quot; although I visited the USA for at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is tremendous .
&quot; as many of my generation I grew up with American films , I have read American music and operated by American music and operated his sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had a profound impact on me , that I was mainly because of an American film journalist . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , who covered with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts as an Jura student , who had covered his interest by Julia Rober@@ ts as the Jura student , who wanted his interest in mind . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free to Meth@@ od Man , &quot; &quot; I was , as if that is the absolute truth , you forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year , which I lived in Arizona , had more admir@@ ation for the US only . &quot;
&quot; I always said , &quot; America is the only country where I have ever lived , whose variety is so inv@@ iting , that you can always be that you are and it is easy acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I had even written a very warm@@ ed view of his size .
then Donald Tru@@ mp came .
much was written about x@@ en@@ op@@ hobia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his as@@ cen@@ sion is for me as he goes with his bott@@ ling .
he never stops with his opinion behind the mountain as it says so beautiful .
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks of like a former colleague , and explained publicly his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ American and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million voices , which he won in the Republi@@ can presidential elections , was the highest number that ever reached a candidate candidate . &quot;
I was speech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans who support this big@@ so@@ ons person , I asked me ? &quot;
&quot; I was able to bring Tru@@ mp and his voters do not bring to people with people , which I met in Phoenix during my time . &quot;
&quot; as for example my Professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journalist program , the people from all over the world take , a deep beli@@ ever man , which I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; the Tru@@ mp@@ s world illustr@@ ates not with the by Peter Bh@@ atia , the current publisher of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bh@@ atia and I met us in our common love for basketball , and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix Sun &quot; while playing . &quot;
&quot; intoler@@ ance is also reflected in contrast to gener@@ osity that I lived at Sandy B@@ ahr , who fought for her life for the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like their son . &quot;
&quot; still it fits to the commitment of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace to me and my colleagues helped us to get used to the complexity of the American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew L@@ eck@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise couns@@ el helped me a lot with my career . &quot;
these people and those through it incar@@ n@@ ates my love for America .
&quot; while Tru@@ mp took his way to nomin@@ ate Republi@@ can presidential data , they offered me a stop and the counter@@ part of his restricted vision of America . &quot;
however it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
&quot; on November 8 , 2016 over 50 million Americans , mostly white , the pres@@ idency of a man , despite - or perhaps because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation with the idea that people have voted for Tru@@ mp because they either shared its rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were ready to over@@ see these things , and broke me almost the heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to describe the Tru@@ mp dial as a cas@@ hier .
&quot; to arrange the people , said one of my friends , is exactly what we have led to this situation . &quot;
&quot; this is super@@ ficial and respect@@ ful , and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act in another way and think . &quot;
it shows the people that their worries and fears about the h@@ ec@@ tic changes in their communities are not considered .
could it be that these voters have voted most of whom most white are tun@@ ed for Tru@@ mp because they want to reg@@ ain control over a country that she disappointed ?
&quot; in other words , they might want to say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who commented the cru@@ el decision to raise a man who look with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look differently than he . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; ( m . ) : so much as &quot; &quot; resolution of the wheat against all other eth@@ ni@@ es &quot; ; Wor@@ t@@ acle from white in reference to the White and W@@ hi@@ pl@@ ash , as much means as Sch@@ leu@@ der@@ trau@@ ma ) , as it did the great Van Jones called , exactly what America did so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people all over the world appreciate American Ide@@ al - regardless of whether my@@ th or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background one may have always appreciated , America means every welcome . &quot;
&quot; for this country elected as his president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; with the election Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s , however , there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says : to hell with vers@@ atil@@ ity , religious freedom and the whole concept of plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is again at the ru@@ der , they say . &quot;
&quot; in all that I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Kh@@ an , the father of a soldier who dropped in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
at a demonstration of Hill@@ ary Clinton Mr. Kh@@ an had a wor@@ ding metabolism with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , would have my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Kh@@ an .
&quot; the crowd answered with a &quot; &quot; strong &quot; &quot; no ! &quot;
&quot; if Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; breaks the crowd . &quot;
&quot; have Lat@@ inos a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; answer@@ ing them . &quot;
have A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans a place in your America ?
&quot; no ! &quot; they called and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; would anyone else , who is not as you , a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; he received an un@@ anim@@ ous and accor@@ ding@@ to@@ strong &quot; &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; Mr. Kh@@ an closed with the words : &quot; &quot; God is thanks , Mr. Tru@@ mp , is not your America . &quot; &quot; 36 hours later he was correc@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; the land , for which his son enjoyed , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tru@@ mp@@ s Land , said the message . &quot;
&quot; and all people who look like Mr. Kh@@ an , could no place in this new America . &quot;
and that breaks me my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean city of Cat@@ eur@@ a together ?
&quot; that music that is played in both places , not only the life of children has changed , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a great g@@ arb@@ age dump , only 16 Kilom@@ eters south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city , which is very popular among tourists among the nearby pre@@ mier@@ ed ruins and its world @-@ famous kitchen . &quot;
&quot; since several years now , the La B@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) has now been playing in the municipality : one of children and adults of existing sym@@ ph@@ ony orch@@ estra , which has found an opportunity for over@@ coming the poverty . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the municipality , located in one of the poorest provinces of Mex@@ ic@@ os , is known for its drug abuse and the ban@@ den violence . &quot;
&quot; however , this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth were so rare hop@@ eless . &quot;
&quot; the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , means the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI : &quot;
&quot; once they come from the school , they go back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to tackle her great passion . &quot;
&quot; they always come l@@ end and with sh@@ iny eyes and play in the chest you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clar@@ inet , O@@ bo@@ e , flute , B@@ ong@@ os and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from Tr@@ ash
&quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a - a village , which lies practically at the largest g@@ arb@@ age dump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paraguay and capital - on instruments that are produced from re@@ plac@@ eable waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ prepared instruments made of local fixed waste materials , manufactured in a workshop for musi@@ kin@@ stru@@ mente in Cat@@ eur@@ a where the recycling have started under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez to turn parts of the case in instruments . &quot;
&quot; the instruments mim@@ ic viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , co@@ elli , contr@@ ab@@ asses , gu@@ ards , sax@@ oph@@ ones , tro@@ mb@@ ones , tro@@ mb@@ ones and per@@ cussion , all of which were made out of the tr@@ ash . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ pertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ian and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article of the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez , a local environ@@ ment@@ alist and music @-@ instruc@@ tor of the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a , to the initial time : &quot;
&quot; first it was very difficult , because we had no place to rehear@@ s@@ als and we had no place at the same point where the parents worked in the tr@@ ash . children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents , because many of them do not live with their children . &quot;
&quot; this changed as F@@ avi@@ o , what he has never seen before : one of the fall of waste . &quot;
&quot; today , there is an entire orch@@ estra which plays on instruments from restored material and is called The Recy@@ cl@@ ed Orchestra . &quot;
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( harmon@@ ic tr@@ ash pon@@ ie ) draws the musical performance on :
the world creates about one billion tons of tr@@ ash each year .
those who live with him and by him are the poorest people - like the people in Cat@@ eur@@ a . Paraguay .
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
land@@ fill harmon@@ ic follows the orch@@ estra with his inspir@@ ational spect@@ acle from tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orch@@ estra played his music even against Pope Franz@@ is@@ kus :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can be able to tackle illegal fishing activities
photo Â© F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats the wild of illegal fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Bry@@ ce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , published in a magazine that specifically reports international , practic@@ ed solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
re@@ publication is done as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
&quot; in West Africa , that this ship had already been operated in liberal waters of illegal fishing , before it was the other coast of Africa . &quot;
the East @-@ African countries were here as appe@@ aling and little gen@@ ces to welcome a law@@ yer of this kind in its co@@ asts .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Kom@@ oren , Mos@@ ambi@@ que and the Seych@@ elles mobili@@ zed down quickly towards the ship . they refuse him to share one of their ports and ref@@ used to share it a fishing permit . &quot;
&quot; &quot; Ur@@ su@@ suddenly was the prime minister surrounded by countries , which you simply re@@ alities of everything , &quot; &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , an un@@ preced@@ ented part of the Ken@@ yan Fisch@@ erei@@ Authority . he is part of a team that discovered the ship of the ship . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch the fish there . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia because of pill@@ age of fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which protects discrimination and resources , F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop Ill@@ egal F@@ ishing ( Ill@@ eg@@ ale fishing stop ) . &quot;
&quot; the members of this network are distributed in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , which at that time the prime minister had driven out of its waters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; with this we have eight countries to work together and work together . they exchange information from and stand up each other when it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project ending Ill@@ egal F@@ ishing . this project offers the F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is regulated by definition , which is caught , is hidden , why it is extremely difficult to use it . thus , the illegal fishing is a major matter of over@@ fishing of regions . &quot;
&quot; through the ab@@ at@@ tained mis@@ cont@@ emp@@ t of existing laws , by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing eco@@ systems may have harm which have a del@@ ik@@ ates balance . &quot;
&quot; however , while actions against illegal fishing was once h@@ eight@@ ed through bureau@@ c@@ ratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the Schn@@ eck@@ ent@@ emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , so the actions today occur in real time , with trac@@ eable on the ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; there , each other countries can share a list with each other as a list of lists , news about susp@@ ected activities or details , which one noticed during a port inspection or experience . &quot;
&quot; Fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive , if these are moving on the open sea , by satellite TV . &quot;
&quot; this allows the authorities to mark ships , which fishing in the bot@@ her@@ ed areas . also let &apos;s un@@ fold the rides - about such that indicate a ship its folded fish out on other ships . &quot;
&quot; in the ide@@ al@@ case , such investigations may show whether the students involved have a fishing license where they were on the road and may also whether they have a pen@@ al code . &quot;
&quot; countries that are opposed to illegal fishing , the acceptance of such ships can be used in their ports . what does the ships could not sell their charge . and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is then about significant financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is not worthwhile itself anymore . &quot;
&quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Berg@@ h , leading Director of NF@@ DS Africa . the latter is a mountain company which supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already mentioned platform was created to estimated 20 million USD in lost sales , who lose the eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i each year because of illegal fishermen that penet@@ rate in East African waters . &quot;
East Africa has one of the productive t@@ una @-@ fish that attrac@@ ts the region &apos;s commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also those illegal fishermen .
&quot; to their practices include actions such as the sailing under false flag , counter@@ f@@ eit licensing securities , indication of fantas@@ y , the fish @-@ protected species and fishing in nature areas . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non @-@ long organised control system &quot; , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; earlier , a ship could not be illegal fishing and a country could say &apos; You dar@@ ed my harbour . &quot;
yet another country could say &apos; com@@ m to me &apos; . &apos; and exactly this leg@@ ale mu@@ up@@ fle@@ w tries to close the ISH @-@ i .
until now the closed front is working .
&quot; since its foundation , F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 studies of susp@@ ected ships . &quot;
it has un@@ covered networks that had spread counter@@ f@@ eit licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships who used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has found fle@@ eting vessels and found .
&quot; due to its collaboration with Inter@@ pol , the International Authority to combat crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime &quot; , &quot; says Berg@@ h . &quot;
&quot; he builds a system , the F@@ ISH @-@ i should help , verd@@ ant ships precise . &quot;
photo with friendly permission of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; Fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always further developed , helps them to hide the illegal ships that would like to hide themselves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . and we try to cross up , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chef@@ analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at Tracking , a N@@ RO , which also deals with fishing data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
some of the ships also place their automatic identification systems as they can no longer be operated by satellite .
&quot; Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that connects different information levels . it is to help the ISH @-@ i to find criminal vessels with greater precision . &quot;
a Modell@@ programme
but can F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team African nations actually influence the un@@ question@@ able global problem of illegal fishing industry ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch : a platform that offers satellite tables and can be displayed throughout the world &apos;s position . &quot;
&quot; &quot; themselves together with neighbours to get a better picture of what is doing - this gives simply sense , &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to bund@@ le their resources . &quot;
&quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run , in which a global system allows the persecution of ships . &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only sense crime but they also fri@@ ght@@ ened .
&quot; ships that have been exploited without a license and hardly expected to calculate the consequences , now they know that they are observed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in the F@@ ISH @-@ i participated in the meantime by a 33 % increase in fishing hub , fishing boats and buy more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped Gre@@ ko 1 consec@@ rated , the insp@@ ectors found there on board flo@@ pp@@ ings , whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo with friendly permission of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries are notic@@ ing these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we can now copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we are a study object held annually several hundred million dollars by illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; there are six countries participating in 2015 , for so called West Africa Task Force . also they are fighting the illegal fishing industry , according to exactly the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With safety is the goal , even more such initiatives and structures to be created in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youn@@ gest member states in Somalia could report his first big tri@@ umph in October : in October there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship which was on the way out under fal@@ scher &apos;s flag . and not only the ship was used without a license and were used tu@@ cked network , which are now prohibited . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated even in bot@@ her@@ ed waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the Take of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , the strong sign that they go against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Berg@@ h . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such special , collabor@@ ative approach to protect the oceans actually works throughout the world sea .

the road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of fier@@ ce demonstrations .
they are regarded as protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum of the President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the government of Venezuela had rejected the amend@@ ment of the opposition to a referendum for a referendum , re@@ acted the Venezu@@ el@@ ans , in their eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country where they were scattered on the streets . &quot;
under the has@@ ht@@ ag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the return of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
&quot; the debate will also be guided by the country in other parts of the country - among other things in the bor@@ land@@ region of MÃ©@@ ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a , located in the central @-@ north of MÃ©@@ ri@@ ob@@ o and Isl@@ a Margar@@ ita at the State of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country is deteri@@ or@@ ating continuously , which makes itself noticeable in the everyday life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an ac@@ ute lack of food and medication . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw in the Am@@ t@@ sen@@ th@@ ai of the current President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro the chance of a fundamental change ; ultimately , the dra@@ fting of a re @-@ election of the official authorities was blocked . &quot;

&quot; on Twitter you can buy pictures that tell of disputes , as well as reports of repres@@ sion and abuse . &quot;
&quot; particularly large waves , the message suggested by police oppression in the central @-@ northern city of Marac@@ ay . &quot;
there the demonstr@@ ators went back into the local cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government .
hours later they were able to leave the cathedral again but the protests went further .
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators sought to stop the police forces , including those woman in the An@@ den@@ State T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a : &quot;

meanwhile a Info@@ graphic is already giving an information about the extent to supp@@ ression per day :

the interview was translated into English and published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to see the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of C@@ Ã³@@ rd@@ oba . &quot;
as an adult man said Qui@@ j@@ ano now said in the context of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ ber@@ a process in the province of C@@ Ã³@@ rd@@ oba against his father .
&quot; in the process , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were examined , which were committed during the Argent@@ in@@ ean military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not changed his life .
&quot; starting at the brush , the same name as his father contribute to the bru@@ tal military stations in the prison La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he has suffered enough . &quot;
34 years he kept the family @-@ race for itself .
in the situation at that time I believed that it was fine .
I felt like a secret .
&quot; as a child with 15 years , you don &apos;t know that one is manip@@ ulated by his father . &quot;
&quot; at that time , I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , Fol@@ ter@@ er and mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ arm@@ eri@@ am@@ ter . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship , from 1974 to 1983 , a time of stat@@ ero@@ ism , his father was from 1976 to 1978 Dep@@ uty Com@@ man@@ de@@ ur of intelligence department 141 in prison La Per@@ la . &quot;

&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ press@@ ors that is indic@@ ted by ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the ab@@ duction of a 10 @-@ year child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who had experienced the extent of the atro@@ cities which he had experienced as a boy , and who said before a federal court against his own father . &quot;
&quot; his story shows , which great power has a parent on his child and how this child has chosen a way of salvation . &quot;
from the sports hall to the military base .
&quot; when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went with us into the sports hall . I had to be caught up with a boy , the mar@@ tial arts . &quot;
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black photo , and asked me to identify my friend to it . &quot;
he said :
&quot; you are a Ar@@ sch@@ lo@@ ch , you took you with one of the ERP . &quot;
pass just that they do not rede@@ em you one day and I have to save you .
&quot; the ac@@ ron@@ ym ERP stands for E@@ j@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolution@@ ary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Revolution@@ ary Labour Party . &quot;
&quot; therefore he offered me to go back into the sports hall . several days later , he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
&quot; he said to me , I would become secret . &quot;
&quot; I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought , that would be ok . for so my father had educated me . &quot;
on the military base I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
&quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , Pro@@ pag@@ and@@ amat@@ erial , books , just everything . &quot;

&quot; there , the prisoners are tor@@ tured &quot;
my father took me a total of four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
during the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time he command@@ ed to myself . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the cars , furniture , television , fri@@ d@@ ges - simply all possible - stood . &quot;
everything of it was st@@ olen .
&quot; he gave me a small into a blan@@ ket wr@@ apped and command@@ ed to me to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great cl@@ ump of silver . &quot;
on that day I went to the other end of the Bar@@ ac@@ ke where the st@@ olen items were ab@@ sent and subj@@ ected to a guard@@ ed .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are being tor@@ tured .
&quot; I sp@@ aw@@ ed , and saw a li@@ ege , on the human being tor@@ tured . &quot;
it looked like a field @-@ bed and metal @-@ feathers .
later I found out that they attached to an end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was straight th@@ under@@ ed .
&quot; they in@@ sel@@ dom a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , cap@@ tiv@@ ated him with water and gave him a charge of 220 Volt in gen@@ it@@ als . &quot;

the bases there was in it was f@@ oul ... like a dirty win@@ del .
&quot; later , when my father was under house ar@@ rest , the same smell came from his room . &quot;
I realized the smell immediately and me became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked me : how is it possible that a man can do another so much suffering ?
&quot; I knew , that these people were killed . &quot;
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where prisoners were cap@@ tiv@@ ated with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and bind them . &quot;
&quot; he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilians , which was also charged in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people with the face down - all were folded to hands and feet . &quot;
near the entrance c@@ au@@ ded people still on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; when my father noticed that I looked at the prison@@ er , he said , &quot; What gu@@ ck@@ st you so , Ar@@ sch@@ lo@@ ch ? &quot;
&quot; why did you tell me , why did you get to me ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and buried by soldiers and buried .
I know that because my father told me at home .
&quot; besides La cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms , which were designated as an office . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero moved to a man and fat@@ al .
&quot; according to the details of survi@@ ving the civil war J@@ orge Rom@@ ero , which was also charged at La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ ber@@ a process , which was named Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death . &quot;
&quot; in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the head of the memorial , La Per@@ la , through the former tor@@ res . &quot;
&quot; the way to which you came here , is also the way , on which the kid@@ n@@ apped came here . &quot;
&quot; if you look at the map , see that they took about this path and then tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot;
here their names were changed and they were assigned as part of the process of de@@ aler@@ ship .
&quot; when they survi@@ ved the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement of up came , that they should be moved . &quot;
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the dis@@ rup@@ ture of the people and the dis@@ appearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; Con@@ cord &apos;
my father brought all possible st@@ olen things with home .
at that time I had no idea what the &quot; war &quot; - how she knew it - was .
&quot; but when I was later at the military , I was in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie - I realized that war was a b@@ aj@@ on@@ et or perhaps military signs which one takes an enemy who fought one enemy . &quot;

&quot; but if you go into a house and the refrigerator , the turn@@ table , clothing , paintings , money ... sti@@ cky , then this is no war , but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always asked me like my father , the leader of the security forces , with this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I simply don &apos;t understand it .
&quot; I was also officers with the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie and me , it would never be caught , to penet@@ rate into a house and to ste@@ al everything in it . &quot;
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; once he called me a cri@@ minals , and I rep@@ lied , and thou that thou sh@@ ould@@ est cars on the street ? &quot;
you are no crime ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded before W@@ ut , suggested bringing me and cr@@ ying : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and bring you closer . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we need no one ! &quot;
so my father was .
I have no only good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the trial , I showed a photo of then , on which I started a jacket and a escal@@ ator pul@@ lover from Wol@@ le . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still carried clothes with home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , blame me the defense , to be a con@@ j@@ ail with this crime . I ref@@ uted , no problem , they can lay me to load what they wanted . &quot;
I was anyway there to speak .
&apos;@@ the dis@@ appearances of the body is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act &apos;
&quot; now , where I am older , I find rep@@ ent@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; I have children . if you only have children , one sees the value of a life . &quot;
&quot; one develops and realis@@ es that it is wrong , to kill . &quot;
I even went as far to say :
&quot; well , you have been ex@@ ited during the dictatorship of the dictatorship . but what they disappear ? &quot;
why children have kid@@ n@@ essed ?
one day my father brought a girl with his home ; his mother was killed .
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked me the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
one could have just been able to get into prison .
&quot; I appreciate it , it was simply decided to kill these people . but what they disappear ? &quot;
had these people not also families to whom you were able to pass their mort@@ al over ?
the tight@@ ening of the body is the final ab@@ omin@@ able act that you can do one man .
&quot; my father told me when the democracy was introduced again , they took machines to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were h@@ ort@@ ed and somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; you will never find something , &quot; &quot; said my Father . &quot;
but something naturally always remains .
I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I even was at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crime - including my father .
&quot; the thought to indicate my father was created during a conversation , when he stood at the house ar@@ rest . &quot;
I made him anticip@@ ation because of all the atro@@ cities that I had to experience .
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; I do not know . I have no one killed . &quot;
&quot; I felt gri@@ ev@@ ous and asked me , the whole exag@@ ger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; which they were supposed to be defended . &quot;
then I cri@@ ed :
how can you tell me something ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me as a child to participate .
he ref@@ uted only &quot; Na then forgiveness me . &quot;
this is what I did .
2010 I made the first ad .
I was finally recognized that he was a cri@@ minals .
nobody can throw myself that I have been taken . I finally have said against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died at the end of May 2015 at the end of the process .
&quot; he was indic@@ ted for 416 pen@@ alties in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture with subsequent deaths in five cases and a case of ab@@ duction of one under 10 @-@ year child . &quot;

a translation error makes older people in Ky@@ oto zu &quot; terrible car drivers &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a centre in Ky@@ oto where one can extend his leadership .
the photo was spread in social media .
arrangement of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese city of Ky@@ oto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can extend its leadership , in the last month witnesses a very special translation . &quot;
&quot; on a sign the Japanese word conf@@ ection@@ ery , the &quot; older drivers &quot; means , &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; means , &quot; perhaps - maybe even with mal@@ ign@@ ant back@@ rest &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; &quot; terrible motor@@ ists &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the wrong translation was on electronic advertisements in the entrance area , and in the building itself . &quot;
adapting to the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine which was often shared in social media .
&quot; the error was the transl@@ ator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident Ky@@ ot@@ os . it was also that the local time was attentive to it . &quot;
the daily Ky@@ oto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an insu@@ lt to the elderly and in an international city like Ky@@ oto just unacceptable , &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was initially removed . the name &quot; &quot; drivers &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate , alb@@ um@@ matic term &quot; Elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Ky@@ oto ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation errors . furthermore , they stated that the bug had already been included in the text , and that the translation has not been tested on its accuracy before she was published . &quot;
a blog@@ ger reported as follows on the exc@@ use :
&quot; we are sorry that older people felt through the in@@ adequate correction ( the translation ) of our part , the police said . &quot;
the Japanese online news officer J @-@ cast news was a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; terri@@ bly &quot; was indic@@ ted as an in@@ adequate description of the driver &apos;s motor@@ cyclists . according to the police there is the share of passenger motor@@ ists who are nation@@ wide in accidents , but quite an occasion for concern . &quot;
&quot; in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Ky@@ oto , for example , in 2005 , 41 of a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents were caused by Sen@@ iors . this corresponds to a percentage of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , senior Sen@@ iors 1,8@@ 03 of altogether 11.@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
&quot; so , their share rose to 17,@@ 7 % . &quot;
&quot; while the number of accidents has fallen in total , the proportion of senior inci@@ dents is caused in the same period . &quot;
&quot; the nam@@ es@@ cent not mentioned Repor@@ ter brought to light on Yahoo released version of the article , showing what pre@@ judi@@ ces some Japanese have seem@@ ingly against older drivers : &quot;
the article on Yahoo about the translation errors received among other things the following comments :
- &quot; Is the ( &quot; &quot; terrible motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; So faul@@ ty is the translation really not , or ? &quot;
I don &apos;t find that this is a true translation error .
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so spreading throughout Asia
translation errors are widely used in Japan and Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a real foundations for these bizarre mistakes in English .

the reasons for the wide distribution of transl@@ ators are mani@@ fold .
&quot; to transfer one needs two important skills : passive language skills to understand the starting text , and active language skills to put it into the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter demands the active rule of the target - something that is in case with native lingu@@ istics . in general , the conviction that transl@@ ators should be in the target language - not in the output language - mother@@ tongue should be . &quot;
&quot; thus , a French native language language should be translated for example from English to French - not from French to English . &quot;
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Karl Bar@@ on .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as mother@@ language , which might have translation into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of the transfer , cost @-@ reasons or the relatively small number of English native tongue , the japanese language . &quot;
&quot; some companies who have no foreign workers , have yet made some foreign employees , but then the Japanese staff will be made as the best , to transl@@ ator transl@@ ators - regardless of how good or bad his language skills really are . &quot;
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Karl Bar@@ on .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; the wor@@ shipped and r@@ ush@@ ed sent@@ ences , which can be created by machine translations , show that this technique is not yet able to replace a human transl@@ ator . this applies to some languages entirely . &quot;
&quot; some of the strange English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the puzz@@ ling form@@ ations containing often T @-@ shirts or po@@ ckets , are used only for class@@ y reasons - not to be read or even understood . &quot;
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be as jewelry still acceptable or at least harm@@ less . but by big companies or by the government that have the funds to ensure higher standards , one can expect more careful translations . &quot;
the city of Ky@@ oto uses a serious source of translations for their translations .
Venezuela : protests and cement @-@ actions on the internet and television take

&quot; on Fri@@ day@@ tomorrow , the 7th of April , the Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users , that they could not have access to the online channels of Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later others wrote others users , that the internet pres@@ ences of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV are no longer available . &quot;
&quot; other online transm@@ itter received recordings of the protests in Car@@ acas , which were organized by op@@ position@@ ists , who res@@ ist the Nicol@@ Ã¡s Ma@@ du@@ ros government . &quot;
&quot; the protests began in early April , after the Supre@@ me Court was dis@@ solved and transferred the Parliament &apos;s responsibilities to the executive committee and the Supre@@ me Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Tr@@ ac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection may be connected , and recommended the U@@ sers , V@@ PN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the internet . &quot;
# Zen@@ ith : activ@@ ates your V@@ PN .
it seems that Internet sites of ven@@ ez@@ ol@@ an@@ ic providers have once again blocked .
this is from the site of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access and especially in times of un@@ rest .
&quot; traditional media has been hes@@ it@@ ative since 2014 in reporting of protests . at that time , the Commission threat@@ ens them with money . then , if they continue to report about demonstrations , since the Commission saw this as &quot; call to violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
without cable TV and informative national television channels I registered with @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that this continues to be cheaper than two lit@@ ers of Lim@@ on@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay by a blo@@ cking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) un@@ accessible , but also two other online channels . this also concerns the website , on which the National Assembly is transferred . &quot;
&quot; previous post @-@ research of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had sur@@ render that local Internet provider may use DNS purposes . this is a technology that failed to respond to the DNS requests from specific domains . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server answers incorrect or ref@@ uses the request when calling on such a website . &quot;
we confirm a DNS control : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
&quot; with V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the transfer on Thursday , the 6th of April , set out when the V@@ PI@@ TV Camer@@ am@@ ann El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who contributed the protests in Car@@ acas , in cust@@ ody . &quot;
Flor@@ es was be@@ aten , while he was in a police force . &quot;
&quot; eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went back to show . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government regul@@ ates the Internet connections : thus the Venezu@@ el@@ es of access to multimedi@@ al coverage of access to multimedi@@ al coverage in the country is becoming more difficult . &quot;
Paraguay are becoming a lot of girls to get a training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was as a child a cri@@ adi@@ ta . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina fighting for the rights of children and coll@@ ects de@@ mean@@ ings of other Cri@@ mes that have been precisely how they were victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;
photo of Cec@@ ilia Ro@@ jas . use with kind permission of cur@@ tural .
&quot; the following article is the shor@@ ten@@ ed version of a report of course , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors . &quot;
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ uel@@ an , es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que CAEN &quot; ( &quot; tile C@@ ows , dec@@ aying schools &quot; ) , which is edited by Global Vo@@ ices and Latin America . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household in which she was not living together with the family who lived there .
shortly before their gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about it . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; that , from which something has become &quot; , &quot; said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as cri@@ adi@@ ta , in Paraguay which are forced to work more than 46.@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a big family with little money gives its min@@ ar@@ old son or her min@@ age @-@ year old daughter to another , plentiful family . in exchange , the child receives food , training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what does not mention it is that the children must do countless days of home@@ work which can never be paid and sacrific@@ ed victims of abuse and abuse - and all that in the context of a contract you cannot raise . &quot;
this referred to as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go practice is widely used in Paraguay due to participation and acceptance of large parts of society and in spite of numerous complaints from human rights organisations .
&quot; after completing their studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked a few years for an organization that is fighting for the rights of the boys and girls . &quot;
they spoke with Cri@@ mes of Cri@@ mes - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - coll@@ ents to say , re@@ cher@@ ished and p@@ ran@@ ger@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; she tried to name things in the name , because the feeling of gratitude , which is humili@@ ated to the Cri@@ mes of Cri@@ mes , guaranteed in general . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double de@@ ception , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family that their daughter is in the faith that they make their education possible to improve their position in society and make something out of himself , to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family , who takes the girl with himself and justi@@ fy its exploitation by faith that they would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no training , and maybe even star@@ ve . &quot;
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; if the girl is mis@@ directed , his family will only experience many years later . &quot;
sometimes they even experience them .
&quot; in January 2016 , the previously was relatively unknown phenomenon known in the Hid@@ den in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ian household , but a face . &quot;
&quot; as Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº into hospital , her body showed traces of fier@@ ce be@@ ats . just that she died . &quot;
it was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of former Mil@@ estone F@@ errei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as a Beam@@ tin in the inhabitants .
&quot; Mar@@ Ã­n lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small place with only 3,000 residents 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n . &quot;
&quot; in late January 2016 F@@ errei@@ ra suggested as long as with a stick to Mar@@ Ã­n , until they suffered fat@@ al injury . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of a young girl .
a few days later the media reported about the inci@@ dent .
they stressed that the child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deep into the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen society toler@@ ate practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
they marked the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of sla@@ very . &quot;
several do@@ zen people came together to protest names and called for &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay are more cows as children registered , be@@ kl@@ ed Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to hurt the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbours of the husband and almost 60 civil society organisations called for an additional investigation into the case .
they want that Tom@@ Ã¡s F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was sentenced to 30 years in prison .
&quot; if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n must be the case for the first time in the history of Paraguay is a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go before judgment . &quot;
the everyday life of a cri@@ adi@@ ta
&quot; Cri@@ adi@@ tas will not only be exploited as labour forces , they also live isolated from other girls in their age . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ ona was working in which her father had to sign up and her father lost his work .
&quot; your brothers now had to work all , and began to sell money on the road or on the market of sweets to make money . &quot;
but they all went on to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
in the house of her employer Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
yet they had to share the time so that you still have time to learn .
she stood at every morning against five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for her employer .
&quot; for example , they clean@@ ses the refrigerator , p@@ utz@@ za the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the ground . &quot;
when the school was at the end she went home again and had time to learn .
&quot; the more she was done with learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
but even this time was limited because they had to have dinner for their employers .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she had never had hungry , but there was also not unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the landlord as food from the refrigerator , &quot; she reminds me of them . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belong@@ ed to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party that was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;

he tried to convince them to convince the reports of the official media on the regime of the dict@@ ator .
&quot; he held it for intelligent , but he held not with her . &quot; &quot; the househ@@ older had found someone who heard , while he spoke about politics , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they allowed me not often to visit my family because they feel that I would be able to learn that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a who would like to speak to the indigenous group of Gu@@ ar@@ an@@ Ã­ back home again . she said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a who would like to speak to the indigenous group of Gu@@ ar@@ an@@ Ã­ . &quot;
&quot; their Lord fear@@ ed that they had the formation , which they had to be able to lose again , explains them . &quot;
&quot; however , it was completely clear that they had been paid for everything she got of them with their hard work . &quot;
&quot; also at school was Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a dis@@ crimin@@ ated . &quot; one thing about which is almost never spoken , har@@ ass@@ ment and the Sch@@ ik@@ anen , where Cri@@ adi@@ tas are exposed , when they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they recognize immediately that someone who has no parents , is a cri@@ adi@@ ta . &quot;
I was unable to invite anyone to my home . I had no friend in school or in the neighborhood .

draft legislation writes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

published by the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; six@@ teen Egyptian parliament@@ arians have recently voted &quot; &quot; the regulations regarding the use and commercial social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when he accepted by the parliament , users must register users and users of social media in Egypt at a government authorities to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law the site would then be set up , which is contrac@@ ted to share the citizens to share social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months with acceptance of the law , users would have to register for users and users on the site of the site with their correct names and personnel numbers to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; it gets failed to do this , so it could get a sentence of up to six months in prison or fine fine . &quot;
&quot; the bill &apos;s bill , which consists of six par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ils and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent cur@@ ated , defined social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application , which runs via the Internet and is used to communicate with others using voice , video formats and text . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear how the law is en@@ forced when the draft gives no reference to how Egyptian authorities do not agree on how the Egyptian authorities are unable to register with the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to guarantee regulation on stage of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , parliamentary member and conveyor of the legislative process , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received from Tele@@ comm@@ sm@@ inist@@ as , and a password &quot; to come by the Fire@@ wall , the Facebook blocks . &quot;
&quot; this could mean Egypt plans to rede@@ em a Fire@@ wall at the national level around Facebook . due to those , it would be necessary for the Egyp@@ tians and Egyp@@ tians to access the network to their identity . &quot;
&quot; however , it has not yet been known that such plans do exist . &quot;
experts and experts on site are s@@ cep@@ tical in regard to the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; German resear@@ cher &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I am greatly committed to the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt with regard to things which have to do with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that same as they could control the physical public and private spaces it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; when I take it seriously , then this means that they will apply a strong surveillance system to apply citizens or not . and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to carry out a cour@@ ge process . &quot;
this is technically no means realistic - but in Egypt all is possible .
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the Leg@@ isl@@ ative Parliament and the Constitu@@ tional committees , before it goes to the plenary session . &quot;
&quot; whether his assu@@ mption and enforcement will be successful or not , the design &quot; stands in line with a pro @-@ military thinking in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ised and will be ensured that there is no gro@@ oming ni@@ ration on the image space , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; in the past year , the parliament@@ arians T@@ amer El @-@ Sh@@ ah@@ aw@@ y proposed a legal basis against cy@@ ber crime , in which a life @-@ long prison for those planned was found to thre@@ aten the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest the &quot; public order . &quot; &quot;

&quot; in the beginning of March 2017 , documented that for the northe@@ ast@@ ern Japan , K@@ imp@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o that have been achieved in recent six years to re@@ build the life of those who had been affected by the &quot; D@@ reif@@ ach @-@ catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . an enormous earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom in Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima did the catastrophe . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung has its headquarters in ship@@ ai , which is located in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a popular pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan , which had to experience the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
hundreds of thousands people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighb@@ or of Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima and I@@ w@@ ate have been forced to disappear because the ts@@ un@@ ami had all the coastal cities disappear .
&quot; in addition , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima had a atomic accident , and it alone had to leave 160 000 inhabitants of their homes . &quot;
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o shows out of local vision which progress has been reached after six years to re@@ build the lives of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains the statistics of the Japanese re@@ constructions and survey results of the persons concerned themselves .
&quot; housing estate in Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned spare houses ( production ) , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate were finished . &quot;
&quot; the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures could go Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , here 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has finished 75 percent of such houses , where Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima is formed with 70 percent the final light . &quot;
&quot; however , one still has to strive for six years after the catastrophe , ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated by Beh@@ el@@ ines ( perf@@ umes , kas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) into final replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after the triple catastrophe , almost 80 000 people saw to live in Beh@@ el@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 , 36 000 people lived from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima and I@@ w@@ ate in such housing . &quot;
&quot; almost 40 percent of the year 2011 Ev@@ ac@@ ush@@ ima is still living in an emergency , where Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i live here more successful . more than 75 per cent of the ev@@ ac@@ uation were rel@@ oc@@ ated after the disaster in containers , were converted into final houses . &quot;
for I@@ w@@ ate the number is here at 34 percent .
the state of the work and everyday life in the three affected vic@@ tories
&quot; how the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o Newspaper could determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools who have been affected by the un@@ happiness , which took place almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ages are far more difficult . &quot;
&quot; while almost 100 percent of fish ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i have now returned into operation , in Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima only 30 percent of fishing ports . &quot;
&quot; the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atom@@ an accident , have moved into the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of ag@@ gressi@@ vely in collaboration . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could recover 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of the agricultural country in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destru@@ c@@ tive A@@ cker@@ land in Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is just a result of the atomic accident , for just 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed A@@ cker@@ land of Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima , are lying in the &quot; nuclear blo@@ away zone . &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism often recovered again and again there is Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima far down@@ cast . &quot;
the tourist bus in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back to 90 percent on the same level as before the un@@ happiness . Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima but it can only exceed 75 percent .
&quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal regions , it is more difficult to earn their livel@@ ih@@ ood . &quot;
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; to determine a total picture , the paper conducted numerous surveys among the native population and under the ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated through . she asked them about the state of re@@ build up and also how you get involved compared to the ts@@ un@@ ami risk . &quot;
in her introduction of this article the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Newspaper Kleine Zeitung :
K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o led a survey conducted by more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the native population in experience .
&quot; the survey brought , that 8@@ 3.1 percent of the local residents have taken steps to be prepared to be prepared to future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; however , 5@@ 5.9 percent of respon@@ dents find that still not enough in matters of disasters prevention has been done . &quot;
&quot; as it comes to those , who had to be ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated from the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima . &quot;
&quot; in its edition of the anniversary of the earthquake , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung also focused its attention on the situation of ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated from Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima not only had to co @-@ experience the enormous earthquake and the devast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima was also a witness of the worst , disasters caused , atomic accident , the Japan ever had to experience . &quot;
&quot; of 160 000 ev@@ ac@@ ized from Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima , almost 63 000 people were displac@@ ed in areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; early 2016 was more than 23 000 people back to Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima , back to Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima , in permanent spare houses . &quot;
&quot; after 2017 , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; in the disaster areas , most of the ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated houses , who still have res@@ trained in containers , older than 50 years old . they are in proper containers with massive construction projects . this is part of the Olympic Games , the part of the Olympic Games are to be held in Tokyo . &quot;
the world is small : our Podcast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when people encounter people from other countries that speak a different language , the differences appear to be greater than the simil@@ arities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , one often recognis@@ es that one more connects as it seems at first sight . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important as they demand our pre@@ judi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world ultimately is very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Podcast , we look at this global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Podcast we treat topics that often get less attention as they deserve . &quot;
&quot; we speak with five global Vo@@ ices members , who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly linked to someone over language and country borders . &quot;

an Brazi@@ lian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week into the intensive care station : last Friday had taken him a police officer during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with a stroke against the head . nation@@ wide participated millions of demonstr@@ ators in a Protest@@ ant against austerity .
Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva Tarok studying the social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a sk@@ ull @-@ deer trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors oper@@ ated him this Saturday and now have moved him into an artificial com@@ a .
his condition is considered to be critical .
the local sculpture Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus the spread over a couple of days quickly in Brazil .
&quot; on the pictures , the face of the police officer is also identified with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o Samp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
&quot; after the inci@@ dent , the military police were known in the Brazi@@ lian federal state Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , that Samp@@ ai@@ o was reported until the conclusion of the investigation of the inci@@ dent of the active service sus@@ pen@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; the pictures show the police officers , as he be@@ ats in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with its head@@ stock on the face of the student Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) . &quot;
would a police ru@@ sted by a prot@@ esters and land on the Inten@@ sive station would face his face six months long on TV and the entire repres@@ sion would be justified .

Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil where it came on the last Friday to bru@@ tal police officers against demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; polic@@ emen clim@@ bed in protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had er@@ ected a stage for speakers , rubber and Tr@@ Ã¤n@@ eng@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the Euro Fl@@ avi@@ o Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Fried@@ en@@ spart@@ ei ( PS@@ OL ) bat asked the police via lou@@ d@@ speakers to for@@ ge violence against demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; once again the Brazi@@ lian media are cor@@ rupted by following the focus on another , un@@ expected prot@@ agon@@ ists l@@ enk@@ ins : a window . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported on a zer@@ bro@@ ker glass window to make with a photo their front sites illustr@@ ative .
&quot; on the contrary , the O Glob@@ o preferred a title story with a brand in fire . &quot;
&quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken window as over the protests of thousands of people who serve the defence of a special thing . &quot;
&quot; this must also recognise , if one is strictly out@@ lined against any form of atomic damage . &quot;
&quot; also here the term &quot; &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; is an absur@@ d , dis@@ proportion@@ ate meaning , and the typical non @-@ violence of the military police are influenced by head@@ lines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on the confrontation with the police &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the forgotten villages in Cuba
&quot; with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar beet factories in all Cuba the doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ AT@@ IS@@ TA ) &quot;
&quot; Greg@@ ory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , located in the western part of May@@ abe@@ que province , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar beet - , regardless of what there is no significant sugar @-@ harvest@@ ed on @-@ site . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities were laid in sugar beet factories .
&quot; after being there stood still the sugar beet industry in the region , and the factory lost after and after its plants , until only the rum@@ ours was left out of steel and concrete . &quot;
about 272 workers had to re@@ inv@@ ent themselves .
some are rarely the work .
others res@@ ign@@ ed and pen@@ um@@ bers every day to the factories that still mobil@@ es .
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , which is open every day at 4 : 00 am , the crisis in sugar beet industry is not inher@@ ited its sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that in the east of the region of sugar beet factories , who are back into operation after a long time , because they were obtained . &quot;
that was something he was not expected .
&quot; N@@ ene remin@@ ded exactly that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , I would receive the sugar ro@@ hr@@ fabrik , but the promise has not been held . &quot;
&quot; the su@@ gar@@ s industry already resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ efficiency , the poor management decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , the production of 1,6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the 1910 produced . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a m@@ otive for the country for some decades , but the bad harvest@@ ing are already no new . &quot;
why was the Cub@@ an Sweet@@ gre@@ gate Industry ?
the old railway line of the church looked already better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ AT@@ IS@@ TA )
&quot; the reduction of sugar beet industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar beet factories were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive they were un@@ sustainable to the country . &quot;
the initial idea was to concentrate the production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tons . &quot;
they left only the factories behind the sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the moti@@ ves that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis in the world market .
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar price rose to approximately a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 the price of un@@ refined sugar between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound stay , according to the 2016 published report &quot; &quot; Agricultural Initiative &quot; of the OECD and FA@@ O , the Agricultural and Nutrition Organization of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if the current production level would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.9 million tons ) , the raw material would be around 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day with security in history , that was the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from there , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , the st@@ agn@@ ation of a total of 98 sugar beet factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for continuing education . &quot;
the same happened in the sugar ro@@ hr@@ fabrik Greg@@ orio Arl@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto P@@ Ã©@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; if N@@ ene is known as soldier , about the closing of the factory , the word that he is repeated the most , &quot; fraud . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would become still@@ ed .
&quot; thus , the place is received , they formed a full time - working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first sight , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially dis@@ closed documents that would only be removed from the parts that would be removed , the Ad@@ res@@ sat and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the ministers could have rid of any de@@ preci@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; from there , the responsibility was over@@ thrown and the letters were ever more frequent . &quot;
&quot; Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for two years for the still@@ ed factory , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the still in operation . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Colom@@ a . &quot;
&quot; he was against his will at the stand@@ point of the factory , in whose construction he helped , involved . &quot;
&quot; with each part he was removed , he dis@@ counted one of his 31 years . &quot;
the best developed industries area of Cuba and more important work@@ load was er@@ ased .
&quot; in many cases , no alternatives for working and services were generated by the plants in the municipalities where they found themselves . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if the mamm@@ oth @-@ speech from 21 October 2002 , the then president in the eyes of the present persons saw , when he guaranteed that for the areas , their factories for five years have been no longer run , everything would run well . &quot;
the price of the population for the closing of sugar beet factories
since 2004 the su@@ gar@@ s has been extrac@@ ted only high through m@@ illing .

&quot; after two years the Greg@@ ory de Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar ro@@ hr@@ fabrik closed , or better said than they began to buy them , they also heard on the road to asp@@ hal@@ ing this also dis@@ advantaged other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to search other factories . &quot;
they were to be spare parts .
without refu@@ gee perspective on a time also many young people were the region .
&quot; in the area , a food factory was created , whose production serves not even for the provision of the community . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still im@@ posing .
&quot; at the end of 2016 N@@ ene went back to the factory of Boris Luis Santa Colom@@ a , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;
forty @-@ eight@@ y harvest@@ ing bring to the old soldiers a deer of two thousand pes@@ o per month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich .
&quot; Mr N@@ ene , a man black skin colour , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a tragic person , nevertheless he gives the lies that one told him not . &quot;
they have been running him for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene is born with 65 years in R@@ ente , not because it is lacking in power , but because he is hidden . &quot;

first Nations teen@@ agers use Hip Hop to express themselves and get their own culture
recording a song of &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an .
&quot; young people of the First Nations communities in all Canada are dealing with topics , which are important for them . they do they do with Hip Hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops . &quot;
&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour has been held directly to schools and youth centers for youth groups , recording , audio and video production and live performances since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were guided by the ped@@ ago@@ gues David Hod@@ ges , who lives in Montreal and in North @-@ Queb@@ ec with ten Cre@@ e @-@ Communities and then worked with the Cre@@ e Hip Hop group The North@@ Stars together . &quot;
&quot; the workshop rises with that the young participants in talks like &quot; cultural identity , language , discussion , love , self @-@ employment , or whatever comes to the meaning . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main purpose .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the W@@ inn@@ eb@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the School &apos;@@ Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia tells the story of the Highway 16 , also &quot; Highway from the t@@ ears , &quot; in which almost two do@@ zen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or mur@@ dered . &quot;
the cases were largely un@@ solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the mot@@ if of a video player to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences through globalization .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages though the young people have not always master the languages of the First Nations .
&quot; in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ ste@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation added , the ref@@ rain will be sung . &quot;
&quot; the young people involved here received a little help from Gary Jol@@ ly from the North@@ stars Hip Hop Group , which gave them a st@@ rop@@ he in the Di@@ al@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; on the Fac@@ ebook@@ page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the St@@ rop@@ he is available in case , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German : &quot;
&quot; sometimes , I feel as would not ever be interested in me ? &quot;
but I try to continue my days on earth
that is the day when you take our cry out
because we have lost our way as a youth in life
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
how can they grow and address our youth
&quot; so , they can do that , which they determined the cre@@ ators &quot;
in the commentary box the reader and supporters of the Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also added a contribution and adds the st@@ rop@@ he in sil@@ mar@@ ital ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) :

in Japan you can see almost every restaurant of plastic dishes .
&quot; to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , are exhibited in the vicinity of the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( , perf@@ umes , &quot; Plas@@ tic models of the courts &quot; ) of each dish , which is served in this restaurant . &quot;
the customers will see these plastic meals and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry which is dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the to@@ ki@@ ers district K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi there are a variety of these small companies , who are making those plas@@ tic dishes made that the German film@@ makers W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a was documented over 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most of Japan these plastic dishes are usually so usually , that they are not even running more of them . however , a new trend is turning it today in stri@@ king phone accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
&quot; at N@@ aver Mat@@ ome , the blog@@ ger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos that show this unusual tw@@ ist with sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
&quot; now in special sale : new with plas@@ tic@@ ated cell phone bands , as they are shown at the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu Kauf@@ haus . &quot;
&quot; many of these artificial food were changed to kit@@ sch@@ ed anth@@ ologies , as in this case , mag@@ net : &quot;
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin Ref@@ ug@@ net for a new exhibition in Tok@@ io @-@ Station .
the new B@@ oom of the Essen@@ ti@@ fications is becoming increasingly fat@@ al .
in this case a k@@ ais@@ en @-@ don was converted ( a popular pad@@ dle with seafood ) into a mobile phone .
for this three @-@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as mobile phone numbers .
also this part we have made for the exhibition at the Tokyo railway station .
and here is an apple that will keep your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to watch like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that is just the beginning of a growing sight .
&quot; some cell phones and mobile phone designers allow you to manufacture your own art work . in this case ik@@ ura or laugh@@ ing uses , a popular t@@ opping , served with white rice . &quot;
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; is there someone who would say , &quot; Wow , cool , now I can susp@@ ect my mobile phone with laugh@@ ing ? &quot;
I believe I will probably be the case .
&quot; this interest in plastic labels can also be a less appe@@ aling form , to surprise for example colleagues or family members . &quot;
our new mobile phone rings has the form of mel@@ ted ice .
&quot; in addition , there is also Rei@@ sb@@ Ã¤l@@ le ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , E@@ arr@@ ings and Hand@@ y@@ b@@ ills made of dried salmon . &quot;
further sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile plastic labels can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s N@@ aver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter using the has@@ ht@@ ag # appeti@@ zer .
&quot; if you like to learn more about the origin of this trend , then this video gives you an insight into the district K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi which is dedicated to the lo@@ wering of the restaurant industry . such as with sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually made .
a Mexican project tells stories of the survi@@ vors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the struggle against drug dealers . &quot;

&quot; in reports , and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; struggle against drug trading &quot; in Mexico , the missing and spec@@ ulative regularly only appear in statistics . these reflect not at all the extent of the human tragedy , which this struggle brings with itself . &quot;
&quot; the coverage of drugs , such as El Ch@@ apo Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the leader of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ ells , the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a non @-@ violent inci@@ dent , there is hardly anyone looking at the grap@@ e or on the congreg@@ ations that have learned with the pain . &quot;
&quot; there are behind each body , behind each bone tanks in the hundreds of a secret tom@@ bs , the stories of zah@@ ll@@ os@@ er parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wo@@ unds might never heal . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico learn the digital project &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vivi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with drug retailers ) and told stories of people who reported in the struggle between the law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describes the project so :
organised crime can not only be afraid for our lives .
the effects are far profound .
&quot; for example , when doing business close because they are threatened by drugs and whole municipalities so many kilometers to buy something such as milk . &quot;
the pain of victims
a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear life changed &quot; ) tells them precisely these stories .
&quot; one main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who is secret of every weekend of secret tom@@ bs after his son . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ guez , who lost in just one day her father , her four brothers , her husband and two of their ne@@ ph@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; priest : &quot; &quot; like every Sunday we also prepare ourselves again to the task that we have provided us , go and to gra@@ ves , according to the people we loved to seek . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ er@@ as : &quot; my son called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ er@@ as Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in a electric store in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came again . Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very difficult for me , for I am now alone with three children who need a training . &quot;
there is also my mother who also is here with me .
at the moment she has no income .
&quot; you are the insurance of my father , but that does not get paid out , because one will demand a stereo . &quot;
where should we get that ? &quot;
&quot; the editors of &quot; Apr@@ ender a vi@@ vir con el nar@@ co , &quot; why the project is so important : &quot;
&quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are to be afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , the break @-@ breaking and government . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the Federal State Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central mex@@ iko . &quot;
&quot; their contribution reminds us that one should never consider violence as normal , regardless of what form it occurs : &quot;
I have now known disease and sensory journ@@ alism for some years now .
I come past every day at time ki@@ osk and see the title pages with pictures that actually only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from the specialists of specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
&quot; sometimes I have the feeling , as if I am the obj@@ ections or sad . it works , such as a lack of respect towards the person who once belong@@ ed to this body once . &quot;
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she continues :
&quot; no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year C@@ ous@@ in thinks that he is F@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) will be when he is great . and it is also not normal that people listen to the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of the crimes , when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me it is , as if they conf@@ use those who have lost somebody and those that fear that they have happened so something . &quot;
I see our weakness when stories are to mere numbers in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; the opinion of the human being is unbeliev@@ able for me , when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearances of 43 students in a neighb@@ or that they were justified . &quot;
I think they are trying to beh@@ ave that they are spar@@ ed by such trag@@ e@@ dies if they are not stir@@ red and silent .
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico @-@ Stadt wrote the article &quot; Four months , ex@@ tor@@ tion in the capit@@ als . in it , she describes how armed crime was de@@ pressed for month money from their business until it was not only destroyed by the business but also their family apart . &quot;
&quot; you think about everything you have lost and remember how many people can change your whole life in just a few days . &quot;
&quot; pain about it never goes , the trau@@ ma stays , the fear comes up again if you are alone . &quot;
habits have changed , phone numbers also . &quot;
we just contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the further we are removed from each other , the better . &quot;
she included their report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you do not know when they will guide you , or to kill you . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself in these terrible days whether to solve my deep@@ ening feelings , but the answers is no , because I have forgotten how to cr@@ ying . I must learn to live with the pain . &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the post &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : one of violence defined generation . &quot;
&quot; in the introduction , he raises questions about how : who takes care of the child of a missing woman and man who were mur@@ dered by organised crime ? &quot;
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous town of Mex@@ ik@@ os ?
he is not like other boys of his age whose parents worry about them .
&quot; Bry@@ an is a Wa@@ ise and he tells about how to make a egg co@@ oks , potatoes , tor@@ till@@ as warm and &quot; Ch@@ ich@@ i &quot; &quot; for the babies that live with him . this is his name for the preparation of bottles with water , sugar and milk pul@@ ver . &quot;
he talks about the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year .
but they are in@@ significant compared to pain in his eyes - in@@ sufficient for a boy for the whole life of violence and the Learning to live .
&quot; when he was five years old , one told him that his mother disappeared . &quot;
&quot; but this was not the day , where his childhood ended . &quot;
&quot; his childhood has been past two years before , when he was only a few blocks from his home , the blo@@ ody Lei@@ che of his father saw , which was shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; when Bry@@ an was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez saw this : &quot;
bry@@ an was born in 2006 as violence by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez the most vulnerable city in the world due to the number of murder for public safety and government of the United States . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the prosec@@ ut@@ or &apos;s office is 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to the cut 8,5 Mor@@ des per day . &quot;
these are just some of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds that organised crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate into the soul of the country .
&quot; only a few stories live in view of new Headlines . however , this project reminds us of those that we may not forget . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vivi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; has established animal journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose aim consists of the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug stores , which has established the country in the last four decades , in an understand@@ able manner . &quot;
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Flick@@ r @-@ User Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ strÃ¶@@ m ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages of which it linked , contain images , shown on which violence is shown . &quot;
the fact check is important in a moment in which it is about to lift up a sm@@ ash or to ent@@ angl@@ ed a for@@ gery .
&quot; but how about something the first time is done ? content in social media , no matter whether true or un@@ true , ten@@ ds to continue to exist . &quot;
let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible accident before seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its first publication , it was mis@@ leading to build trag@@ e@@ dies that actually have taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
this false p@@ air@@ ing of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false description &quot; in termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First D@@ raft News - denied not the fact that there are ample careful reporting about events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our request for pictures to messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
2010 conducted a tank @-@ wag@@ on place in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ te and explo@@ ded with 230 people came to life . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war of Africa , the second largest country had been negl@@ ected and thus devast@@ ated . the streets in the region became a dangerous path full of stroke holes that were difficult to go . &quot;
&quot; typically , the pet@@ rol car@@ riages fell victim to the victim . &quot;
&quot; administration offices described a fire@@ ball , the du@@ sting homes , including a cin@@ emas near , which was full of people who greeted the world championship . &quot;
houses bur@@ nt and en@@ olen cor@@ p@@ ses in the streets scattered .
many people were burned to the ignor@@ ance .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria &quot; . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ User My@@ s@@ tical Mon@@ key , 12 . January 2015 @-@ date photos of the inci@@ dent form the gray scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of shor@@ ten@@ ed body that are up on the floor while people watch them .
but here the story is not its end .
&quot; over the years the same picture has been revealed several times in social media , blogs and other platforms , but are not written in the context of trag@@ e@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what and what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 the B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am the ent@@ leg@@ ic villages B@@ aga and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
witnesses reported dras@@ tically of atro@@ cities in front of which they had to fle@@ e .
houses and shops were bur@@ nt down and athle@@ tics were burned in streets and prayers .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; however , the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; no one remained back to count Lei@@ chen , &quot; said a resident to Human Rights Watch . &quot;
many were disp@@ uted , shot or burned . &quot;
&quot; only with the satellite image , the fol@@ dable time could be displayed . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the attack was also un@@ clear , but the ar@@ mies in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am , country to win ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
&quot; and here the picture of the DR Congo came again on , as it does prove to be evidence of the fact and the potential extent of the attack : &quot;
this is Nigeria .
a mass@@ ac@@ re of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
you are dead .
&quot; in fact , this predic@@ table use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of fail@@ ings ; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
in all these cases the picture was taken as a cover for mass@@ ages .
&quot; one step further bring personal comments such as this example , the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to provide arguments . &quot;
the image of S@@ ange joined in Myanmar with the dead@@ ly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a light@@ ning , published by the United Nations those who could fle@@ e be@@ ats , r@@ ape and et@@ een ti@@ ote , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported from violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts , as the following arose , these descriptions have brought together with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture comes from a su@@ ck @-@ Arab news page , which may be mist@@ aken , the President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein Being said , MÃ¶n@@ che and politicians would have participated in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to beb@@ il@@ ze this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was last accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organisations , the AF@@ P known as their source , also had mis@@ diagnosed Th@@ ein Being of this statement , but had not associated with the image from the DR Congo . &quot;

traces of this false c@@ rank@@ ings reach up to the years of 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from anywhere around the world .
&quot; using a &quot; &quot; revers@@ ed image &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can be over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
a revers@@ ed picture with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found at 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( status of 3 May 2017 ) 344 images that are very similar from the DR Congo .
&quot; they come from a mis@@ use private pages , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are in many different languages like English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have passed wrong reports , others have tried to ent@@ angl@@ ed the f@@ eit@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; we have examples of the abuse of use and associated with the respective countries , based on which side they had been published . thus , we want to represent the range more clearly than through the language alone . &quot;

&quot; the government of Myanmar published a matter what she sees as &quot; inten@@ tional , &quot; news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings concerning Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this matter which has been published exclusively in English , also includes refer@@ r@@ als to counter@@ f@@ eit images of rum@@ ors who operate H@@ ate Speech and be used by extrem@@ ist groups to dar@@ ing that Muslims became Budd@@ hist@@ s and kill them ( what is often used by bur@@ mes@@ an nation@@ alists ) . &quot;

&quot; this message appears obvious that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein @-@ 2012 have been given that mon@@ ks and politicians have been involved in the kill@@ ings of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims , and brought the story with the image of S@@ ange . &quot;
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture continues to be included in it .

&quot; they wanted to achieve that their communities were these events , the mut@@ ually aware in the name of Islam , a greater attention . &quot;
United States , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the picture was stored as a letter for the mass@@ ac@@ re of B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ret@@ we@@ et@@ et ) . but the messages that were associated with it , were raised in no religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the goal was to focus attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media reporting requirements compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
Vietnam ( Chinese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message that suppos@@ edly has been written by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os &quot; &quot; over the Nig@@ eri@@ an mass@@ ac@@ re , in circulation , it over@@ continued discussions like this here on Vietnam@@ ese and explained it to fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
&quot; from the message , in which the picture of the DR Congo was included , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ iner Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os . &quot;
&quot; there are further confirmed examples of an incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;

&quot; in all these cases , which has only appeared to the original soup from 2010 , the image may ultimately be a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and pictures
&quot; there are two strong topics or frames ( inj@@ ections ) , which per@@ ches this po@@ sts . the first frame foc@@ uss@@ ed on religion . &quot;
the photo was used in relation to greater discussion about the silence of Christians by Muslims or - to defend Muslims - the inv@@ itations of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as through Budd@@ hist@@ s .
a second Fr@@ aming uses the picture to discuss how an African lives will be examined in comparison to a European or French life .
religion is to understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth knowing how images are used in connection with these efforts .
&quot; however , a deeper question is what happens if readers cannot cope with these pictures for longer faith . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are young people who have acci@@ dental share the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; suggest that mood of lack and mis@@ representation , that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and lubric@@ ates the real Gre@@ ys of what actually happened in the DR Congo , in Nigeria and in Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread of rolled images was already deb@@ ated in detail ( here for example ) .
an argument is that that with@@ drawn from pictures of a past@@ or is equal to recognize the tragedy . bis@@ cuits these images are even demanded by the victims itself .
&quot; at the same time , the concern is that violent pictures readers and audience des@@ en@@ si@@ tis@@ ation and bring them the ability to emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which under@@ sought , how giant media work to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot regarding violent depic@@ tions in the news media , is fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news report . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Techn@@ ologists experim@@ enting with algorith@@ ms to support the fight against &quot; f@@ ake News &quot; . they will be thorough about situation in which a picture is slightly suggest , which is actually dis@@ solved by the context or on completely ab@@ used form . &quot;
&quot; however , any study of false pre@@ ten@@ ders should also take into account as internationally as internationally . &quot;

a blog with the name Un@@ transl@@ atable ( for example im@@ plac@@ eable ) attempts to provide voice @-@ enthusiastic a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
&quot; these words are available in every language : they express certain situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific . &quot;
some of these un@@ transl@@ atable words are already well known ( like the famous Portuguese Sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are root@@ ed in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all res@@ ist stub@@ born every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or expression is not enough , why a complete statement and sometimes a little context are required to understand exactly what about that one word is meant to be . &quot;
these unique words have been collected quite a time in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists deal Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , during the author and Lingu@@ ist von &quot; Un@@ transl@@ atable &quot; St@@ even Bird decided to concentrate on small languages . &quot;
&quot; in the blog you can find words from the VAT of V@@ anu@@ atu , such as : &quot;
v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Bem@@ an for your parents in recognition of how to have tried you in your younger years .
&quot; and words in H@@ uns@@ rik language , which are spoken in parts of Brazil as : &quot;

in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog About :
&quot; they sc@@ um@@ ers other cultures , reve@@ aling other thoughts , and wake up our curiosity . &quot;
sometimes you can influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page you want to publish more of these &quot; un@@ transl@@ atable &quot; words and show how different we are valuable and impressive to these small languages .

how Sri Lanka goes with the worst flute disaster of the decade
the island of Sri Lanka is currently looking forward to the worst high @-@ water and expression disaster in this decade .
&quot; triggered by the mon@@ soon , which usually lasts at the end of May , are due to strong rain falls the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , Gin , N@@ il@@ wal@@ a and Att@@ an@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; after an opinion of the cat@@ astrop@@ hic center of Sri Lanka , 28 May 2017 126 people were killed and barely hundreds of people are missing because of the flo@@ ods and mud . &quot;
over 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and around 100 000 people were brought to 304 safe place .
&quot; the rain falls on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the falls in some areas went slowly returned . &quot;
health and hygiene standards of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the Fl@@ ut@@ cat@@ us disaster :
flo@@ ods in Ta@@ vern@@ ama city with water intervals of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka Twe@@ et deliver regular updates for the flood situation .
many use the has@@ ht@@ ag # Flo@@ od@@ SL to monitor the extent of disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s dead@@ ly flo@@ ods wast@@ ed the Den@@ gu@@ e@@ fi@@ fe rise , war@@ ns save the Children , after further rain falls on the way . &quot;

the air force has made five planes available for lif@@ ebo@@ ards and further five are made for transport of emergency services for those in their flo@@ o@@ ded villages .
various organizations and start @-@ ups have also en@@ forced to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Rel@@ ief - Information Desk@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on high water situation and humanitarian aid .
if any search and lif@@ ebo@@ ats dr@@ ones need for their operations please call them number 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .

&quot; last year after the catastrophe of the tropic@@ s Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ le introduced a &quot; high @-@ water aid &quot; button that allows users allowed to retri@@ eve a vehicle to pick up the pick@@ up of assistance and donations . these were then free to be passed on to the sr@@ il@@ ting Red Cross . &quot;
&quot; similarly , they had a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button that had more than thousands of requests and 150 successful boot@@ able promotions for using flo@@ ods and dru@@ d@@ ging people . &quot;
&quot; the united effort of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lan@@ kan , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring people in need of security and contribute to support . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of other human life , whereby the population of Sri Lan@@ kan will now be the long way towards restor@@ ing norm@@ ality . &quot;
Muslims which you cannot see

photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ ha@@ zi .
it was used by the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco at the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighb@@ our and love girlfriend .
&quot; I trust my four year old daughter , she is familiar to me her children ; she is my rock in the fire . &quot;
we are still calling for the rights of women in one minute .
in the next sk@@ andi@@ c we protect rights for trans@@ gender .
&quot; we are located in a sea of rain vessels and people , some keep the ik@@ on@@ ical image of a woman with head tow@@ el high , bound from an American flag , other sk@@ andi@@ ze slo@@ gans against Islam@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend look me and says : &quot; &quot; these things does not affect you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; , &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already run these entertainment .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who have known me for years , separate me - the sah@@ ar which they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built itself in their conception . &quot;
it de@@ mus@@ cul@@ ate me .
there are 1,@@ 7 billion Muslims worldwide . &quot;
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves to be a Muslim to different kinds . but somehow we all put into the same Muslim dra@@ wer .
&quot; this dra@@ wer is so well designed in our collective notion so well as Muslims , which as I can &apos;t fit there , mus@@ li@@ ed there . &quot;
ab@@ mus@@ li@@ zed
I am not doing so alone .
this is even happened to the po@@ et , whose poetry is sold in America : Rum@@ i . &quot;
which images do you come in the sense when you think of it ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; as J@@ al@@ alud@@ din Rum@@ i as old as I am now , he was a orthodo@@ x@@ er Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the western conception , the religion of Rum@@ is was deleted , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of 1,@@ 7 billion Muslims of this world . &quot;
another one exists in the oppos@@ ing pictures of Muslims ; the western books have been col@@ oni@@ zing for centuries .
&quot; this temp@@ ting language is determined by the dark man , one should fear and the exotic woman you should save . &quot;
the pione@@ ering Palestinian scientist Edward S@@ aid sur@@ passed in the 1970@@ s the story behind these pictures .
but these pictures continue to stand up today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood worship them . &quot;
&quot; I have worked for three years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful , failed to domin@@ ate our news fe@@ eds . &quot;
&quot; this f@@ ault@@ less over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed the reality that have led their countries in the last three decades , while the US could not even choose their first female presidential elections . &quot;
&quot; this nar@@ r@@ ative fails to acknowledge that when French , Muslim women are prevented from entering public buildings and su@@ ction Arab , Muslim women by their government to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
a powerful group puts its &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; others . &quot;
this strong Nar@@ rati@@ v weak@@ ens mus@@ lim@@ ische women who lead the movements for change .
&quot; it looks ahead , that the first Muslim prayers were spoken to the American soil of Afri@@ cans who were brought to this with sla@@ ve . &quot;
it delet@@ es the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
&quot; this Nar@@ rati@@ v has occupied our collective imagination , so deep and faul@@ ty , that often s@@ ik@@ h men and children become the goal of tim@@ ilit@@ ati@@ cal attacks and per@@ ic@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; because of these stories we tell and due to the way we tell them is Islam@@ op@@ hobia , today not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
among the 1.@@ 7 billion belong
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than just stories to tell stories that are based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ ative that help us understand the world .
and my industry is sag@@ ging it failed to capture the Nar@@ rati@@ vely of the 1.@@ 7 billion .
&quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims led the highest degree of &quot; diverse &quot; religious groups in America . &quot;
more than one third of the entire mus@@ lim@@ ische population in South Africa are African Americans .

four decades ago my native parents came to live in New York to live their American dream .

&quot; at that time , when Kh@@ an was re@@ covered the Sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ mist@@ aken Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now un@@ mist@@ aken Muslim and American ?
&quot; sometimes , when I ask people why I don &apos;t tell me a pig , I say - instead of getting my Muslim recipes , or to carry out my gloves , whom all Muslims wear in themselves - &quot; out of respect for P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
I jok@@ es we wear not all pick@@ guard with us .
&quot; we also have to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional safety checks at the airport . &quot;
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding mus@@ lim@@ ische schol@@ ar , Muslim activists and inter @-@ religious activists who make efforts to fight far widespread lies above Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced at the current volume of a well @-@ treated Islam@@ ism , with money @-@ effects , Th@@ ink @-@ tanks and experts for fal@@ sity information that is our already faul@@ ty picture of what a Muslim is ; or what is Islam , manip@@ ulated . &quot;

&quot; I was born as Muslim Br@@ ass , but a Muslim Br@@ ass was born only in my imagination , when I was four years old , in a pro@@ visional mosque in the basement of a Pres@@ by@@ ter@@ i@@ anic church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social scientist religious life describe , they attack the following terms : faith , behavior and belonging . &quot;
&quot; my mus@@ li@@ man belief and behavior are perhaps not always visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; maybe my girlfriend , my neighb@@ or , my neighb@@ or in the fire , that I am Muslims , when it could look through the 15 meters Bet@@ on and air that separate our homes . &quot;
&quot; she would see the all@@ ab@@ end@@ able ritual with my daughter , when I moved them into my arms , and her the Arab verses to protect the Quran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
each of them repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that they are protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one can not see . &quot;
&quot; my mus@@ li@@ man belief is perhaps not always visible , but my mus@@ lim@@ ische belonging is always part of my shadow . &quot;

&quot; for a people , which was founded by centuries - through a &quot; Empire &quot; coloni@@ zed which a company established a company with the name of Ven@@ erable Bri@@ j@@ dien Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep meaning , to call my only Lord . &quot;

&quot; it means to know that if a tragedy is native to the USA , and the susp@@ ects a Muslim names bears the story four times more than a story with a white attack . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that four@@ teen years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , of a liber@@ ated black slaves with the name Bil@@ al . &quot;

&quot; to be a Americ@@ an@@ ist , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ erin , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Muslim , a Muslim and a journalist , who failed to communicate with multiple st@@ ables , but to fail to others . &quot;

&quot; there is one reason for conspir@@ acy that existed in the dark corners of the internet , now the White House is now . &quot;
they have grown ex@@ pon@@ entially because they have made Muslims to others .
there is another group that has grown ex@@ pon@@ entially by which the &quot; other &quot; created .
&quot; a few years ago , it had not yet been given ; now they domin@@ ate large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am worried about the re@@ alities and the story , which I was not aware when I was as old now , as it is now my daughter , but which made me today to an un@@ anim@@ ous Muslim Br@@ ass . &quot;
things I have left here like a bread@@ cru@@ mb in my speech .
&quot; things that maybe memories aw@@ aken , because in all the inter@@ sections that makes our hum@@ ank@@ ind , may be a story , where someone is made to a &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , Kon@@ vers@@ ations will take place within the 8th annual conference to Islam@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; over a hundred acade@@ m@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; &quot; other &quot; , &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not terms with which we usually throw up in our schools or read our newspapers in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why do I tell this about the TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , who showed us how wars are led and people through the creation of &quot; others &quot; in the public presentation , four decades ago itself of the Stan@@ ford . &quot;
&quot; we need to ask ourselves un@@ convenient questions about the role of it , consciously and un@@ aware of the &quot; &quot; others &quot; , &quot; as it &apos;s my girlfriend and I had no president in which we have no president , the chocolate bar , while he had no president , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1,@@ 7 billion . &quot;
it begins with all of us .
initiative for in@@ cis@@ ors inten@@ ds to protect urban diversity
&quot; Histor@@ en@@ tell , by Flick@@ r @-@ User Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC BY @-@ NC @-@ N@@ D 2.0 . &quot;
can there be an opportunity here and now in spite of a language barrier with someone in connection ?
&quot; for St@@ even Bird and Rob@@ yn Perry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) , the count of stories in their original language is a possible answer to it . &quot;
global Vo@@ ices mainly reported on a different initiative by St@@ even Bird to the un@@ im@@ measur@@ able blog .
&quot; however , the focus of T@@ LS is not written on the written words but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language variety of major cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States where T@@ LS has been conducted since 2015 , the risk that small and not completely so small languages are not passed on to the children there . &quot;
for the makers of the project :
&quot; the mass p@@ ending of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities , the di@@ vers@@ ity accept - safe spaces where people don &apos;t have to forget who they are . &quot;
&quot; while &quot; listen to often inter@@ connected to understand &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; listening to these events &quot; &quot; listening to appreciate , to feel . &quot;
&quot; in this format , histori@@ ans tell their story first in their own language and translate them into English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not a professional lay@@ ers@@ ler , their sur@@ render and their account for this is the listen@@ er to it . &quot;
they call laughter and emotions when the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; the following video shows for example a traditional story from Burk@@ ina Fas@@ o that is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the story of the R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou is also the opportunity to explain for their land typical customs of in@@ cis@@ ors . &quot;
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the catch of the rab@@ bit and the P@@ unch in the language Sh@@ ona from Zim@@ babwe :
&quot; after having explained the meaning of his beak , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked , &quot; how is that to speak to an audience that does not share your language ? &quot; with a broad smile , he shares his feeling of inclusi@@ veness : &quot;
you have heard !
you were attentive ...
they were all with me !
&quot; so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling have taken place in three cities and the organiz@@ ers hope to expand this . all who are inspired by the project , can contact T@@ LS in contact with T@@ LS . &quot;
Puerto Rico calls for the United States re@@ fr@@ aming of the sover@@ eign debt
&quot; with the aim of a new examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which took over 72 million US dollars , participated in a mass land@@ mark ; the Mar@@ sch started at the pu@@ ph@@ ony Capit@@ ol , the Government building of the capital , and ran until the Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ ans . &quot;
she was founded by the group &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la D@@ eu@@ da &quot; ( civil Front for the Neur@@ path@@ ology of the debt ) and the Ã@@ kom@@ en@@ ische Chamber of Puerto Ri@@ cos .
the spok@@ es@@ man of the new debt have also submitted a peti@@ tion on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos calls for the politicians who are responsible for debts and government agencies who are responsible for debts for their cor@@ rupt .
&quot; we call for a financial examination and a guidance committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions appropriate re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation in favour of the economy . &quot;
we are pressing and supp@@ res@@ sed .
the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos refuse to pay a debt that is not their .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not be found with sin@@ ful profit@@ ability .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not in the state of integrated territory of the USA - suffering from a severe financial crisis .
&quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy &apos; propos@@ es a government @-@ profit non @-@ profit organization without party membership with focus on socio @-@ economic development , a law on public responsibility , as an alternative to existing governance . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ri@@ cos requires a wide balance of state infrastructure .
&quot; to be raised from the outside , without the participation and conviction of the citizen shall run danger , to be rejected by the people . &quot;
the demonstration carried the name &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian Web@@ ag@@ ler Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , is missing for over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives have continued the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions that he has made for an open network . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , the annual conference on the digital culture that is oriented towards the digital culture , which is devoted to an event of the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign . &quot;
&quot; MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist in France resident CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , a publishing house supported by called &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &apos; ready books within three to five days , las@@ en excer@@ pts from the book of C@@ ost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective In@@ qu@@ iry ( The cost of freedom : a collective research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book that has been published last year and here roy@@ alties is available , including a number of papers , which deal with the free culture in the face of repres@@ sion . &quot;
it is a hom@@ age to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction there is :
this book wants to beh@@ ave as movements for free knowledge and what the true cost is associated with which this is connected .
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who have participated in the movements for free knowledge , have been working on site to learn about the fo@@ g , who gives our news and to create some sense from our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , to liber@@ ate the beloved and celeb@@ rating internet volunteers , who has been det@@ ained in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot;
&quot; his name was engra@@ ved from the directory of the Adr@@ a j@@ ail , where he was sitting on 3 October 2015 . &quot;
we have no information on his current state or place of residence .
&quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Coll@@ ective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , and indeed immediately . &quot;
&quot; to see how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his involvement in a free culture , many of us start to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , actions and decisions . &quot;
why are we now here ?
why did we decide ?
what have we given up in this process of time @-@ wise extreme convic@@ tions ?
the web developers for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in the Haf@@ t Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the Adr@@ a prison , a non @-@ military institution to an unknown location . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and law@@ yer N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; military police Bass@@ el had on the basis of one &quot; &quot; strictly secret &quot; &quot; of the military courts from his cell into Adr@@ a . &quot;
&quot; he reported G@@ ha@@ zi , she was cont@@ acted on 12 November 2015 by persons who established himself as an in@@ sider @-@ government and she had been aware of an inn@@ umer@@ able death sentence against their husband . &quot;
his place and condition remain unknown .
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively participating in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role to expand access to the Internet and to know the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , Techn@@ ologist and currently transferred to the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project , the Bass@@ el , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
perhaps none of the bas@@ al cultural prot@@ otypes fores@@ ight as the work that he began with a group of ar@@ che@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archae@@ ological sites of the world , was the road cross @-@ rich civi@@ liz@@ ations and here mer@@ ging Greek architec@@ tur@@ es@@ es with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he began with this work , the IS was all going to put it with this architecture that is not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
&quot; this strip is created into the digital archae@@ ology and the conservation has created a time capsule , which will be in@@ valuable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future . &quot;
&quot; typically , Bass@@ el could not yet end this project yet . &quot;
&quot; N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband , his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I have spent my whole life with it , of freedom to dream and b@@ ass@@ el taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el brought me English even when he was in cust@@ ody .
&quot; I learned to read English well , to write and speak . &quot;
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with each one who asked me . he taught other incar@@ nations , to write English and speak English . &quot;
Bass@@ el has opened the gate to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smart@@ phones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he also brought it to others , as they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without they actually stopped one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; in addition , G@@ ha@@ zi is the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a pro@@ xy that she wrote in the years 2012 until 2015 , when he was in cust@@ ody . &quot;
bass and N@@ oura have worked together in the book for a year .
she tasted the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from the Arab@@ ian in English .
the book is license @-@ free .

here an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It happens &quot; :
&quot; it is happening with every visit , &quot;
that I fail in the world of your charming eyes
&quot; that I lose the b@@ inn@@ ess in the moment , in which we embrace , &quot;
&quot; that each of the dangers are no matter , &quot;
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , bond@@ age and gu@@ ardian &quot;
I toler@@ ate the cr@@ ush of the prison
and I put into every detail of your voice and words
that I tr@@ age with passion for me
when your eyes kis@@ sing
and I let another piece of my soul with you ...
I return quickly to my lon@@ eliness .
to get all of the moments

I aff@@ lic@@ ate myself that I will return soon ...

this history is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the protests 2011 against the regime Bas@@ har al @-@ Ass@@ ads have disappeared after the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) , more than 65@@ ,000 people . &quot;
those who have been arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
since 2011 the international human rights organisation Am@@ nest@@ y International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans in cust@@ ody since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
we reiter@@ ate our demand in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Moz@@ ambi@@ que : due to corruption pronounc@@ ed director of cust@@ ody on the previous post
Moz@@ ambi@@ que re@@ acted with anger of an ab@@ rup@@ ture after half of his sentence was returned to the workplace in the state apparatus in which the corruption has been committed .
&quot; this is about Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to four other def@@ endants because of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( approximately 800 000 Euro ) to 22 years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the money from public funds from Moz@@ ambi@@ que , the Council of Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 Board of Directors . &quot;
Cam@@ B@@ aza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately called its re@@ setting into the company what happened on 19 April then .
&quot; in accordance with an opinion of the general state sec@@ ut@@ or of the Republic , which exp@@ elled the motion , there would be no barriers to Cam@@ b@@ aza , back to his old post , since the company was not pro@@ gres@@ sed according to his cust@@ ody . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants are not doing well . &quot;
&quot; the centre for public integrity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , condem@@ ned in an interview with the Deutsche Welle the decision of the company to resume the director : &quot;
represents a backl@@ ash in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a revers@@ al with regard to the efforts of our legal system ; so the C@@ IP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what we take note is that the company should have initi@@ ate a disciplines in against the refu@@ gee procedure . &quot;
&quot; the firm apparently appears , however , and promp@@ ted no proper legal steps for applying the appropriate functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Mos@@ que social media , that is also wast@@ ed this behavior and considers the case as &quot; &quot; conflic@@ ting &quot; &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ b@@ aza a competent type would be , he would have advis@@ er after he was condem@@ ned to a sentence . &quot;
&quot; he could hold numerous lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could be advised and his image polished . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ compet@@ ently , he has hon@@ oured to be re@@ integrated into the company that he helped harm . &quot;
&quot; consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza will be paid for his silence . &quot;
# { el@@ ap@@ sed }
&quot; bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ ambi@@ que and student of politicians in Brazil says , the director poss@@ esses no mor@@ ality : &quot;
Cam@@ b@@ aza from the state because he bel@@ ated him I can &apos;t believe that someone has been rewarded in such a way that the state has already been so massive .
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza lacks mor@@ als to return and to the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead she has served only the state by itself . &quot;
Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state as hand it became an unbe@@ ar@@ able money source and the state itself has become tired of being pre@@ loaded and sentenced to a long imprisonment .
&quot; hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te pre@@ fers the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remind you that a th@@ ief is in prison : &quot;
&quot; Di@@ ebe is part of the prison , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el will not only be remember@@ ed as a first independent president , but also as a sharp , cutting and - next door - proph@@ etic Red@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; one of its most famous oral depic@@ tions was , as he confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man was capable of all , also the f@@ ather@@ land for its ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest to sell . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if a ambitious man changes , my experience indicates that that isn &apos;t that way . he does not change tactics , but it does not change from its ambi@@ tions . &quot;
a ambitious man is also criminal .
in Twitter the reactions were also dra@@ ined :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison he sat 10 years and came free .
&quot; and today it sets him the company , in which he who betra@@ y money , again under contract . # Assi@@ m@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - BEN@@ ED@@ EN _ Raf@@ ik ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12 May 2017 &quot;

Facebook blocks the r@@ acial word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar with many users
the bur@@ mes@@ an word &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; means K@@ ich@@ er@@ erb@@ se or Sp@@ age .
photo of San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Commons , Creative Commons Attribution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported
&quot; according to information from Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known Social Network took their po@@ sts out of the net , because they enth@@ used the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although over the origin of the word still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people ost@@ atic origin , or generally used as an ad@@ jective &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook c@@ ens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or &quot; , &quot; ( bur@@ mes@@ an script ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widely spread problem of the H@@ ass@@ language in Burma in the social network . &quot;
in recent years the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely low @-@ bre@@ aker circles .
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by Ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in the effort to fight H@@ ass@@ language in Myanmar , the company has recognised a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; Kal@@ ar &apos;s may normally be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word itself is not automatically revealed to itself . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that also Po@@ sts , in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doub@@ ted the purpose of its use . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are several bur@@ mes@@ ic words with primary mean@@ ings that have the same book@@ shelves as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair will also be written on the same name &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &apos; ( columns ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ ebook@@ used A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at declared the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
&quot; a post of one of my friends has been deleted today , because he was the word of Kal@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; however , he had wonder@@ ed his friends on a rich way , whether they could do his back pain , by doing a wor@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; the set ku la - &quot; &quot; healing &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + the Fr@@ age@@ word ( la ) - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; in Win is the opinion that they will decrease H@@ ass@@ essing radi@@ al nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook analy@@ tic group@@ ed , before it all po@@ sts holes that are in sus@@ pic@@ ion , rac@@ ism . &quot;
Facebook delet@@ es the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it filter@@ ed the word automatically .
Automati@@ cism does not understand what you &apos;re on fac@@ be@@ ook .
what it should do is to analyze the post carefully and verify it by checking the f@@ og@@ gy words .
&quot; for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; ( columns ) . &quot;
&quot; the good is that these dre@@ ck@@ ling nation@@ alists to spread the H@@ ass@@ language , a fairly good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to describe their nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to all , the hate language , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot;
&quot; the experience of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ chat have proven that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of stroke often becomes a cat - and mouse @-@ game , using social networks simply to begin to express a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the word term to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described , as Facebook started to delete his po@@ sts , when he only wanted to communicate with his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; from the social network is : &quot;
&quot; when I was aware of this new directive on Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my mail from Facebook is removed and me the li@@ ken , post and parts of content for 24 hours is prohibited , because the post &quot; Facebook Community Standards did not speak . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of po@@ sts of people who have no negative intentions or simply try to show their opinions against H@@ ass@@ chat radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post has been removed that nothing has to do with H@@ ass@@ language :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post the author expressed his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have more to do before the beginning of the initiative , for example the bur@@ mes@@ an Internet Community asking for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention , rac@@ ism in Burma due to their platform but it does not work . &quot;
to sing such words will only bring more hate within the different communities .
it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden things like &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; pe@@ sen@@ cur@@ ry . &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they have made mistakes , they tried not to be correc@@ ted , deleted po@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; if they had only little more respect for the 15 million health benefits , that would give them a large turnover would be great . &quot;
fac@@ ebook automatic c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship has taken care of a lot of sp@@ ector among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users can now take care about Facebook funny and are aware of the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of H@@ ass@@ language to see if their po@@ sts are taken from the grid . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots from Facebook @-@ Po@@ sts , which were not included , but still removed : &quot;
with permission .
the bur@@ mes@@ an text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch an inher@@ ently cur@@ ry and an Indian film .
&quot; just to try out whether Facebook is the post office , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; post guides &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you cure people ? &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists , have used social networks to expand their voices and influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , H@@ ass@@ language in social networks shall promote violence in Myanmar in Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hist@@ s have forced thousands of escape . &quot;
&quot; Facebook was told for his failure , the pre@@ dominant H@@ ass@@ chat on his bur@@ mes@@ an pages under control , critic@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; but instead of simply hearing the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; , it would have been better in context than on the code , focused initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Trin@@ id@@ ad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is the end with the children &apos;s children
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s inf@@ ants is in Trin@@ id@@ ad and Tob@@ ago now illegal .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament adopted the country un@@ anim@@ ously adopted a law which aims to offer this practice so that the married age is now at 18 . &quot;
&quot; prior to this change of the husband , some members held consec@@ rated and Muslim Religi@@ ous Religi@@ ous Religi@@ ous Religi@@ ous Religi@@ ous Religi@@ ons in May 2016 , the leader of the Inter@@ religious organization ( IR@@ O ) , a group , represent@@ ations of the various religious groups of the country gathered , that the state is not em@@ bodi@@ ly , since that , age does not domin@@ ate the matur@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; this happened , regardless of the fact that Trin@@ id@@ ad and Tob@@ ago is a contrac@@ tor of the UN &apos;s legal management , the min@@ ors as , each person under the age of 18 . &quot;
&quot; statistics from the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were with 15 already married , in Trin@@ id@@ ad and Tob@@ ago was 2.8 percent , and with 18 were 8.@@ 1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the statistical analysis of the country confirmed that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social @-@ media movements , who were stri@@ ves to make laws to children , followed on the foot and are big support . undoubtedly hal@@ ves them to bring this outcome . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no concerns , the critics of children to say , they should take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition taught for tensions in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and at some point they came to whether the opposition would agree to the law bill . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 , the Leg@@ isl@@ ation was decided against children &apos;s inf@@ ants - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of opposition and an independent , which he could be discussed , so that he could make a simple majority of him for the law . &quot;
now only the President of the country have to agree and the law pro@@ claim .
one of the sen@@ ators of the country gave to Facebook a status update which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram was again posted :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the Leg@@ isl@@ ation bill against the children &apos;s birth was decided at the representative of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes and not only decided against it .
&quot; after having decided in the Sen@@ ate , the design can now become the law . &quot;
the majority of the social @-@ media users was enth@@ r@@ alled because the laws were finally changed for children &apos;s children .
Facebook @-@ member Lov@@ ell Francis which is a minist@@ erial post in the Education Ministry of Justice , said : &quot;
&quot; it has just needed a lot of time and un@@ necessary talk that has entren@@ ched the heart of the matter , but know what ? the children of children is in Trin@@ id@@ ad and Tob@@ ago is now illegal and that is almost every price . &quot;
&quot; while A@@ bel Jackson of my opinion , it was definitely long enough to finish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ ent@@ r@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ crowded that the day was finally reached : &quot;
&quot; public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ ent@@ r@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , , Her@@ vor@@ ti@@ ze News ! &quot;
the couple has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , listen@@ ed to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society group , which openly spoke openly about how important the adoption of the law is , &quot;
the married age in Trin@@ id@@ ad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious freedom of 18 years .
&quot; the draft for the change to change has been adopted today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; at the representative of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , there are 41 members and were 35 at the vote present . &quot;
&quot; all members , who were against were voted for the law . &quot;
the children &apos;s inf@@ ants is under Trin@@ id@@ ad and Tob@@ ago are not permitted by law .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # child@@ mar@@ ri@@ ag@@ ei@@ sch@@ ild@@ abuse .

a Th@@ ank you to our members .
&quot; however , a possible h@@ ooks comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aja so the Secretary General of San@@ at@@ an Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hind@@ u @-@ organization of the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago Mahar@@ aja has announced his intention to undertake judicial steps , the law should be adopted , and he seems to engage his promises . &quot;
&quot; during the general state @-@ General Paris Al ra@@ wi , an advoc@@ ate of the law , said , it is quite timely , if Mahar@@ aja wants to move against the Law , the most Social @-@ media users , one would lead the debate on the subject differently . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
&quot; rather , if we , instead of keeping the discussion so generally speaking , in a way that we , instead of talking about the problem that the state , our daughters before , that they may be affected by major , hard @-@ minded men that they might be compared to them , would you be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you believe that this is not a problem ?
&quot; however , whether it comes to a judicial approach against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the children of children are legally legal or continue to be the standard , though there are laws which they teach . &quot;

&quot; the h@@ acker post@@ ers the YouTube video &quot; &quot; He is not a Dim@@ on for you &quot; on the website of the state , with the following comment : &quot; &quot; the citizen &apos;s office calls for citizens to follow the pro@@ vocation by all non @-@ s@@ ank@@ ed events ! &quot;
&quot; at 11 the news of the page was removed , however , it remained intact . &quot;

&quot; on Sunday morning , the office of the State &apos;s office is distributed to the local news service Yar@@ News that they were ch@@ opped . &quot;
&quot; through the mir@@ rors of Web sites , Turkish user can look at Wikipedia @-@ content again . &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ speaking Wikipedia @-@ site was presented on 18 January 2012 , estimated at the SO@@ PA ( stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copy@@ rights legislation in the US , internationally missed . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC BY @-@ SA 3.0 )
&quot; since more than one month , Turkey has been sc@@ aled the popular and crow@@ ds@@ ourcing principle based Encyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; day for day becomes more evident , how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information . &quot;
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series are against the blo@@ cking .
&quot; although many cr@@ ush@@ ed Internet users are used to use revers@@ ed tools for blo@@ cking web sites ( an updated article from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third largest V@@ PN pre@@ valence of the world ) , most of the ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been fin@@ alized in 2008 article from Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University has been held since 2007 , after the Internet Law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;
&quot; according to China Turkey is the most known country in the world , when it comes to the massive c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform remains locked , there are now several Mir@@ ror@@ sites ( pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , considered the platform all the Turkish Wikipedia @-@ pages on its de@@ centr@@ alized Peer @-@ to @-@ Peer @-@ Network ( e.g. calcul@@ ator calcul@@ ator ) , which does not base itself on the system of domain names and thus making a complete c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship . &quot;
the content is not available despite legal ban .
in a blog post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
&quot; after we have heard the news ( on the blo@@ cking of Wikipedia ) , we put everything to submit Snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility to read the content on de@@ centr@@ alized and distributed . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to see at least all the Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wikipedia.org . &quot;
the IP@@ FS also gave that this step independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation has been carried out and it is only about screen@@ shots and no live versions of the website .
&quot; however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to handle the sperm . &quot;
&quot; C@@ risti@@ an Con@@ son@@ ni from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everybody can use to ho@@ ve similar mir@@ ror@@ sites if in the respective country Wikipedia . &quot;
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices member as well as employees at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Podcast :
&quot; it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mirror . &quot;
one attacks on another URL that is not the original . that what you can see is from Wikipedia .
&quot; essentially , the server leads the request to the right Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia yourself then when they are closed in Turkey . &quot;
this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .

&quot; Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he looked around , never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with bad positioned moti@@ fs and balanced colors . &quot;
the motivated him self have a camera to wear and try to commit the situation .
at that time he was still a kid .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar attempts to bring to the international stage at the age of 28 . &quot;
&quot; his homeland right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offering him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that direct attention to Nep@@ tune . &quot;
&quot; he described on Facebook , as it helps him this first @-@ class situation in his work : &quot;
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Parks in a World Heritage Site . what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just returned home when I suddenly called Nav@@ ar@@ aja ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ ai@@ da Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father that would be on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river a Leopard .
the Fl@@ uss@@ dam@@ m is just a few minutes from the tourist resort S@@ aur@@ aha .
immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
&quot; my father had seen him , and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the Leopard was found and I immediately started to cr@@ ack pictures ! ! &quot;
Sag@@ ar seeks cooperation with the authorities to gain global recognition of Nep@@ tune &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as terrible as they look .
&quot; and he ought to know , because he got tig@@ ers already from coun@@ ten@@ ance towards the face : &quot;
a tiger can be bot@@ her@@ ed by the opinion of the sheep not to sleep ! !
late evening . the light is too weak .
bed@@ time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was on the way home because of the darkness on the way home , when the king of the Bu@@ el@@ k appeared . he immediately sit down , we see ourselves and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
but his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ tune is nature and wildlife is not always easy .
&quot; he wa@@ ited for 22 days long , and mostly lived in a tent to take place in Bar@@ dia National Park &apos;s pictures from Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days it took up until he could photograph a tiger , and six to seven days for the perfect picture of birds that live near the tourist facilities . &quot;
see below some of these photos .

this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ aa@@ z K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Volunteers , an award @-@ winning international community organisation from India . &quot;
a revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
&quot; in many parts of India , women avoid women with great care , the name of her husband or even of older men in the family . &quot;
&quot; instead , they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; Father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ as@@ ht@@ ra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect the husband &apos;s social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences they should pay the norm , this practice at life . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condem@@ ned from the Indian state O@@ dish@@ a by a head@@ quarter and rejected by her family and the village community after she had raised a belong@@ ed relative . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of their wives are also not common in the name , is also common among men . however , they have much less dam@@ s to fear , if at all , they should not fall in this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ as@@ ht@@ ra , which stood nine women , including health care , as well as house@@ wives , a unique club and became quickly the main reason of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ arch@@ ate and discuss it .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs which exist in 13 Indian States , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al that is engaged by the community of Video Volunteers and sets out for the dis@@ man@@ t@@ ling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ist has been working with the help of her video camera to the un@@ covering of practices , such as children &apos;s debt up to the exile of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and guides these clubs . &quot;
they reported how these clubs are created a safe place for these women and at the same time they have made bot@@ her@@ ed at the same time .
&quot; the first video , the Roh@@ ini showed in its discussion , were of women who do not name their hus@@ bands . &quot;
she decided on this issue because they wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves .
&quot; not to speak according to the name of their sp@@ ouses , a Br@@ other@@ ly , is a bre@@ eze , and never ques@@ tioned in question . &quot;
Roh@@ ini thinks :
this tradition testi@@ fied that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
&quot; a woman who do not hold this , is considered ad@@ ly , as a woman without moral . &quot;
tradition is so deeply root@@ ed that we never have thought about this discussion .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini wanted to never called its husband until now , at home , as it runs at home as it runs . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion of her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband will take a long time after the video was at the end .
&quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned up to me and said , I have asked him from now on his name . &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage started Roh@@ ini started its first discussion club .
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; after the video proj@@ ection , the women sought to get the discussion with a exercise in motion . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked every participant in the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then asked them all , &quot; If we cannot say the name of our spouse , but they can call us how they want , means they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when she brought the name of her husband over the lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ as@@ ht@@ ra about the Bre@@ ak of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which women never married the name of her husband &apos;s wives . &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells :
&quot; a woman was so sh@@ y that during the whole exercise , a different decided to cut out fru@@ stration against him and his family , by doing it flu@@ ctu@@ ate . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ek@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; even in the adren@@ alin talk about that , with an ancient glasses , the women decided that they would actually try at home to name their sp@@ ouses in the name . &quot;
and they stopped their word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband called a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put in the head : his wife could not stop his name .
another club members decided to do it with dinner in front of the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she an@@ star@@ r@@ te , she got fear and said that it was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant in was less understand@@ able and the situation art@@ ed in violence .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports , such as women have tried to stop other practices , like for example the g@@ ages of the galvan@@ ized red point on the forehead , who shows the sp@@ ell@@ atus : &quot;
why must only women show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would bear the galvan@@ ise red point , if he also worked . &quot;
he laugh@@ s only and I listen@@ ed to him to carry him .
&quot; the other women have not completely heard before , but my , they are now in a better position to choose himself , not to wear it in some days . &quot;
for many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are doing a trip to any discussion club . &quot;
usually we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to make sure that the women make sure who could hear , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; during the last months she celebrated her own birth@@ days in their life their own birth@@ days with cake ; they d@@ anced and s@@ angen and spoke about things , about which they had never thought of thought before . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have spoken about some things , for example how our identi@@ ties have been k@@ not@@ ted to our sp@@ ouses , never so hon@@ estly spoken . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to say certain things according to say , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
in a discussion section we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected with clothes .
some women in the group have taken only Sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most is the okay , but some wanted a sal@@ u @-@ course , a wide shirt about a pants , carry out ; they have not get@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; after much dispute and discussion about the advantages of your own clothes @-@ election , mor@@ als connected to the Sar@@ is and much more , taste Roh@@ ini her own pair of course ( upper hem@@ den ) into a discussion , so that the women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next , they decided now to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure that they will be able to create it . &quot;
&quot; on the question , whether in the five months have already been changed since its first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things are slowly coming to roles : &quot;
we have so far taken small steps so far .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then hearing them again to say the name of her husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , make it yet , but only if they are alone and no other family members are here . &quot;
only one or two will continue to say the name of her husband ; only one or two women now carry interest in Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their forehead .
&quot; the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to reach in their lives - like the f@@ ake around more freedom of movement or their own clothes , - at the end of a hard to navig@@ ate river . &quot;
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is victim of the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am also .
but this gap gives all of us the confidence that will change something .
&quot; and I know that it will not only be limited to 30 families , if any woman in the club goes home and other people who reports what we talk and what we do . &quot;
we are all sitting in the same boat .

this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 to Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version is published in the framework of a partner agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the case of the impro@@ per Chinese discrimination Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has drawn attention to the international community , after his attor@@ ney had given attention to his law@@ yer in the end of June . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 Li@@ u was sentenced to 11 years in prison for &quot; &quot; Subversion &quot; &quot; ( state of state ) , after which he calls on the draft of the Charter , a Mani@@ fes@@ to that the democratic reforms in China had participated . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Foreign Ministry in China has referred to as &quot; &quot; an internal matter , &quot; and a nar@@ r@@ ator told , he did not respect this thing with any other country . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless China receives further views from the international community , the Nobel laur@@ e@@ ates and his wife , Di@@ chter@@ in Li@@ u X@@ ia , release or to allow him a treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are out of the subject completely . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
united nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hus@@ sein , the Hoch@@ kom@@ ab@@ ar of the United Nations for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a speaker leh@@ older however , to comment whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to enable Li@@ u abroad . &quot;
Norway
Norwegian Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ring Br@@ ing have denied any questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway was transferred to the Sto@@ cks , after the Nobel Peace Prize 2010 was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian Government will not have to do anything with the decision . &quot;
&quot; the diplomatic relations have been continued during the December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume the laugh@@ ing went to China because the exports have been largely blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; after the message had been dis@@ semin@@ ated , that Li@@ u was seriously hop@@ ed , the Nobel Committee brought his hope for an unconditional release and invited him to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to its incar@@ l@@ ation , he was not able to take his prize . &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on July 6 , the European Parliament adopted a decision to free to liber@@ ate Li@@ u and his wife immediately from the house @-@ rest and allow him to seek medical support where he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top diplomatic relations of the EU , Federica Mog@@ her@@ ini , called China also for the release of Li@@ us , as in an explanation on 30 June . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us wife as well as family members . &quot;
&quot; they shall meet every visits and can receive , they wish , and be able to communicate with the outside world . &quot;
USA
&quot; us amb@@ assador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad shared that the Americans would like to him , that he has the opportunity for treatment abroad , if it may help him with his recovery . &quot;
&quot; a speaker at the U.S. message in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on 27 June , that the Embassy of Chinese authorities deliver , not only Li@@ u release but also to liber@@ ate his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from their house ar@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; the invitation of the U.S. message moved to an angry response from China , with the utter@@ ance of the State Department that &quot; no country have the right to engage themselves and im@@ partial comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared that China should offer the couple :
&quot; protection and freedom like free speech and access to the medical care of its choice , to which they are entitled according to Chinese constitution and legal systems as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz also introduced a decision in Congress to imp@@ ose the Chinese government to imp@@ ose Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; I urge China to release the Nobel Prize # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally , so that he can embar@@ k in proper medical treatment . http : / / bit.ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o &quot;
Germany
&quot; the German Govern@@ ors Steff@@ en Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin , that Li@@ u gets &quot; all the medical support he needs &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping was published on the 7th and 8th July on the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
&quot; previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing of the news Agency Reu@@ ters that China had great concerns , whether the vor@@ tex about Li@@ u could be over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owing to the visit of Hamburg . &quot;
Canada
&quot; on 28 June , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China called to provide adequate medical care and give it the opportunity to get rid of his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ us attor@@ ney AF@@ P earlier that Li@@ u X@@ ia told him every day , but the police are always monitored by the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to speak with someone outside , including its lawyers , speak and contact . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues on :
&quot; Canada calls for China to protect its international human rights violations , including free speech , real and freedom of use for the exercise of these rights . &quot;
France
&quot; France &apos;s State Department called for China in an explanation on 29 June , Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons : &quot;
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o will receive all treatments which he needs , regardless of where they need . furthermore , his wife and his family can contact him . &quot;
&quot; although the news station France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , announced the Foreign Ministry , there was no further information out of whether France finally start to record him . &quot;
Taiwan
&quot; the Council of the establishment of the establishment in Taiwan requested China on June 27 , release , and to show a greater tolerance to those who use peaceful means to promote political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
the Ta@@ iw@@ anese Leg@@ isl@@ ative Cla@@ ims Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu is called to allow China to allow the cranes of intellectual Li@@ u to treat in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
&quot; spiritual leaders in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed themselves very worried in an explanation on 28 June at Li@@ u . he gave him to pray for Li@@ us well being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives that he took and for which he was strictly pun@@ ished , to a harmon@@ ise , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn had contributed to a peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I felt personally very moved and also encourages , when I saw that hundreds of Chinese int@@ ellec@@ tu@@ als and affected people , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter , signed up for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem du@@ mm since Singapore is recognized as an independent state as an independent state .
&quot; but according to the Minister of Minister K. Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am , Singapore should be considered as a town . &quot;
this observation has triggered a debate in the blog@@ osph@@ ere .
&quot; during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the An@@ wal@@ ts@@ kammer Association of the State of New York , the Minister that many people critic@@ ises the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries . &quot;
&quot; he support that Singapore should be considered as a city . &quot;
... no one has ques@@ tioned whether New York is a democracy be ...
this is where most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io acc@@ used the judicial minister , &quot; &quot; the logic to rot@@ ate &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ it@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , according to all our efforts and sacrific@@ es to create this valuable land , we hear that we finally be no country . &quot;
&quot; it sound@@ ed so vul@@ gar , it had the cre@@ denti@@ als of a flight in front of the responsibilities , a compul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons were not very no@@ ble : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; in view of it , he appeared un@@ obj@@ ectively un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he def@@ ends the idea that Singapore with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York should be compared to equally cities which are permanently from a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; as soon as one reaches the cru@@ x of the theme , the good old cor@@ er of the author@@ it@@ arian makers , who will have Democrats , leave the rot@@ ating logic , as it adap@@ ts better to their power . &quot;
&quot; during the last week of Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am , the answers to his American guests were given to our press , our Judi@@ th@@ atives , our political system really non @-@ responses . &quot;
corresponding questions tar@@ ned with no @-@ responses rational manner .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am to betra@@ yed his opinion because they did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city is , in which country is our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I understand nothing . &quot;
&quot; I would be very thank@@ ful when our hand@@ ler K Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am would take the effort to clarify this point , provided that it was highly paid to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; by sending An@@ on on the blog his comment , he pointed out to cri@@ ti@@ ques that one should begin to understand the entire co @-@ ordin@@ ance of the conference , so that one can understand the context of the statements of Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am better , according to whom Singapore is a city and no country . &quot;
read the co @-@ ordin@@ ance .
&quot; as he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; as a country , &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore was so un@@ equal , even if we are happy and fair elections . &quot;
in Singapore with cities in the U.S. ( and how many of these cities saw a party to win a party ? ) .
&quot; as he said , Singapore , &quot; be no country , &quot; he obviously did not believe in this sense ! &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am known as a leader of a her@@ mitage @-@ growing generation .
I think about what the judicial minister of Singapore has said ...
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de , what I expected to do with them or not , but this is another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes that he is aware of what he def@@ ends . &quot;
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review dis@@ places the vulner@@ abilities of Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ ams arguments :
did Mr. Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am &quot; good a mistake &quot; or was it a Fre@@ ud@@ scher Ver@@ mont ?
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we will only be viewed as independent and sover@@ eign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , on which country go back the sover@@ eign rights of the city of Singapore ? &quot;
Singapore is unique ; it is equally country and city .
&quot; as he plays an important role within the government of government , the statements made by Mr Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am are of serious significance . &quot;
&quot; why are the votes with its military service , they defend it only their city but not their country ? &quot;
who must pay our Prime Minister invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink shar@@ eholder ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the magazine Jour@@ ney of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is always a city : &quot;
I have not told what I said ...
this set seems to have many workers more expensive ...
nobody ever has said that Singapore is a country .
we have always been a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; the defence of the country above all &quot; etc , but that is not quite true . &quot;
we should speak more from the defence of the city .
the my@@ th of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian NE@@ D Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asking her editors : what is most mis@@ understood aspect about your destination or home country ?
&quot; your answers are shown here as part of a continuous series , with the rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world , and another fac@@ et is to be shown . &quot;
&quot; the latest part of this series dates back to Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question that is most asked for me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , sorry I &apos;m sorry . &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; &quot; I am from Canada . &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered polite to show interest in his conversation , by providing personal questions . &quot;
&quot; on my clear@@ ance then follow the default answer : &quot; &quot; Oh , Rock@@ y Mountains , hockey , nature . &quot; &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans may be ad@@ ring@@ ed before W@@ ut when they are kept for Americans but don &apos;t distur@@ b it . &quot;
&quot; for someone who do not know , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Kan@@ adi@@ er of Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans can bring a Canadian flag to their back@@ pack if they travel .
all love Kan@@ adi@@ er .
Americans on the other hand ... .
&quot; so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tru@@ mp , in front of the mar@@ sh@@ y in Iraq and September 11 . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le blades in their luggage to differ from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care !
with us there is no weapons !
gender @-@ sex marriage have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
&quot; all seem to think , Canada is so great . &quot;
we are polite .
&quot; we clearly say very often &quot; &quot; exc@@ use &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Canada is alleg@@ edly considered as the toler@@ ant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not as such as these types south of the border .
we Kan@@ adi@@ er are nice .
I h@@ asse this .
&quot; first , I have many American friends , which I was very admir@@ able . &quot;
there would be nothing if you would like to go for example with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the st@@ amp . &quot;
&quot; first : as &quot; &quot; nice &quot; , &quot; is basically to be sp@@ ie@@ ous - as the good @-@ natur@@ ed , gentle , but trag@@ ically unusual figure NE@@ D Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has its own Canadian dou@@ bles ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really would be a nation full of people like NE@@ D Flan@@ ders , that would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and ed@@ ges , nothing , where you can encounter . &quot;
harm@@ less to be un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting and do not earn attention .
&quot; this can be something good if you want to be un@@ noticed in the background , far from the things that happen around you . &quot;
&quot; I would even go far as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone , a major part of the Canadian . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; what out@@ going as &quot; nice &quot; , &quot; is maybe just a cool pol@@ it@@ eness . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans are not talking about the fence along with neighbours .
&quot; us is missing the warm , open kindness , which I have been connected with my American friends . &quot;
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then J@@ ustin Tru@@ de@@ au pra@@ ying the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has done Canada just sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ ert Thailand &apos;s Jun@@ ta
&quot; one in Thailand famous pop @-@ band has released a music video that the Jun@@ ta par@@ odi@@ ert , which took place in 2014 and re @-@ establish the civilian government in spite of its promises to re @-@ establish the civil government . &quot;
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells them about his girlfriend .
&quot; although not expressly , the music video refers to the continued military rule of the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was invited by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video for the song was a great success .
&quot; only within the first three days , it was shared with Facebook high @-@ loaded video 1,@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month , the Charlie @-@ Chap@@ lin Video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists , to watch this video . &quot;
the video can interpre@@ t as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics that can interpre@@ t in particular how it is dealing with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
look at the videos of the videos that relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has been per@@ sever@@ ely per@@ sever@@ ely pursued in the past three years .
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ fting section 44 of the preliminary constitution , which gives the upper absolute decision @-@ making of the host &apos;s absolute decision @-@ making about important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the &quot; changing &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other persons who are viewed by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crimin@@ ality , whose v@@ ague and non @-@ clear rules are often used by the authorities to ci@@ ve activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit set up in the Army , the online content has been super@@ vised and individuals who were disc@@ ern@@ ed , the mon@@ archy is per@@ sec@@ uted , criminal prosec@@ uted . &quot;
Thailand has set a stri@@ king against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic ste@@ en@@ closure ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , the war was established in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a coup in the army .
&quot; one of the problems which continue to be per@@ sec@@ uted , its decision is expensive U @-@ boats to buy , although security experts they war@@ ned that buying un@@ necessary and a waste of tax hav@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; in the video even shown how persons are thrown into a black supplier , before one brings them into an inter@@ ni@@ fying camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists sit in prison , because they have suppos@@ edly caused a &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; in society and internet users , they should attack the mon@@ archy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the teas@@ er of the songs members of the band , who im@@ itate the Sal@@ ut of &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em &quot; mim@@ ics , who were already used by Put@@ sch @-@ opponents during protests in 2014 . &quot;

&quot; the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the OC media website and appears here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war society re@@ juven@@ ated only very slowly in East @-@ East Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; now over 20 years have passed since the Georgi@@ an @-@ St@@ och@@ ic war has been officially completed , but its sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the Northern District in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show stri@@ king pictures .
&quot; villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ ht@@ a , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the carbon @-@ east Asia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups like Russians , Greeks , Greek Asia , Georgi@@ ans and Armenia had lived and worked in the area in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
&quot; today , the largest part of the Russians and depart@@ ures are living in the area . &quot;
such settlements are called in Ab@@ al Asia .
&quot; in the previous post @-@ war period still lived more than 10,000 people , today there are only a few hundred people living in this state of mind . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district 16.@@ 000 people was increased by over a decade . &quot;
in 1989 approximately 43.@@ 000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a result of the war &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ stor@@ ey residential buildings of the Soviet Union from the early 60@@ s , which are called Chron@@ us@@ t@@ schu@@ kow@@ kas , are symbo@@ lic for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are falling and quite rare they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native old man .
he starts a conversation and it is hard to finish this .
&quot; this is a result of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
it is still unique . &quot;
in front of the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were community centers , schools and children &apos;s bodies , all of the community . &quot;
&quot; now , there is only paved road with blow@@ ing spl@@ end@@ ous spl@@ end@@ or buildings . &quot;
&quot; the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union , have left the district in the meantime . &quot;
in the mind @-@ town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha live approximately fifty inhabitants .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a in the other villages looks similar .
&quot; the Chr@@ onom@@ eter can accommodate one or two families , you can see on the balconies , where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when she discovered me with the camera in the hand , they move away immediately . &quot;
&quot; our mother is forbidden to let us take photographs , &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she has just forbidden it to us , that is all . &quot;
the girl fle@@ ets their girlfriend somewhat to and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ ug@@ ol .
families are also involved in the subsi@@ st@@ ence sector ( cultivation of scenic products ) such as cattle @-@ breeding ; be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable construction .
it is difficult to get to the rounds .
the District administration returns in the winter for free candles and bread to the villages .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what is going to happen , but we will build a cour@@ get@@ te &quot;
about ten years ago an older woman moved to the name of Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ alya as they are called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to j@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; despite their oldest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina does not leave of Ab@@ al Asia to live with her . &quot; &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ad@@ Asia , &quot; she tells us . &quot;
Gal@@ ina wants to accept any financial aid by her daughter and ins@@ ist that she instead supports their young grand@@ son .
Gal@@ ina monthly an@@ ente are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot;
T@@ ante G@@ alya tells you and other vill@@ agers are trying to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
when holidays are we visit ourselves .
but we cannot do this - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
&quot; while she tells her story , a younger neighb@@ or appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; calls T@@ ante G@@ alya her to . &quot; they said , We could build a cour@@ get@@ te . &quot;
I already prepared the ground .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what is going to happen , but we will build a cour@@ get@@ te . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
&quot; G@@ aly@@ as talks in Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time . &quot;
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she is remin@@ ded of the village just before the war .
&quot; despite the relative , who live in Central America , Osse@@ tia and Georgia ( the land of Ab@@ ch@@ Asia was simply gone ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it . &quot;

&quot; we want to build a house there , but that will still take something &quot; &quot; explains it . &quot;
Nat@@ ascha receives for every child about $ 9 children .
your man works in the carbon di@@ ver .
the young family has its own farm .
&quot; near the house where Nat@@ as@@ as Kindergarten was found , they hold pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens . &quot;
&quot; it tells us that it was initially a very fri@@ ght@@ ening situation , as many people left the village . &quot;
but in the course of time they lost their an@@ xi@@ ousness .

&quot; we have no fear of the dark streets or the few people .
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was hardly any job and all lived like it was right .
I remember the same as the city and the war were once .

this article by Amy Br@@ acken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PR@@ I@@ .org and appears here with friendly permission .
&quot; in the way of migrants , Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula he is located on the border with Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - J@@ ill &apos;s Mex@@ ic@@ ress , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink Br@@ ill@@ eng@@ est@@ ell and gold @-@ colored ear@@ rings in Ted@@ dy@@ b@@ Ã¤ren form . &quot;
it is the Concep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and grew up in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless they know many under the name of Mama Africa .
&quot; this nickname , the fact is trained that the hotel ( or rather it has become a target for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ ti@@ ans , which are on transit . &quot;
the hotel does not have any charm .
&quot; for about 2,50 dollars the night sleeping the guests in simple rooms , with cold , cru@@ m@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the pre @-@ room there is a par@@ rots in a c@@ age .
&quot; there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless , hundreds of African and Haiti migrants are here . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez get people in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast start to call : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? .
&quot; at the time it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept outside on cart@@ on . &quot;
it does not want to reject anyone .
&quot; she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , they buy them medications that they cannot pay for them with a Bal@@ m that exhausted from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , is a short time ago . &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa was a reasonable sh@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao Family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i that has a yo@@ gh@@ urt has ) posi@@ ined with Concep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .

&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it fits to her , because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very lov@@ ingly .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
&quot; in Brazil , you have lived in Brazil but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to take normal a first stop in South America and then pull toward the north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard of other fel@@ lows of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells us the Hai@@ ti@@ ans and the Afri@@ cans often go together the track and that the Afri@@ cans already speak on W@@ hat@@ s@@ App from Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
&quot; like many of his companion , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a construction workers on construction site of the Olympic Games and the soccer world championship . &quot;
&quot; as the Brazi@@ lian economy was weak@@ ened , he began his journey into the United States . &quot;
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sold SI@@ M cards to save the necessary money to buy the B@@ usti@@ cket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will contact Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go again , &quot; &quot; he smiling . &quot; &quot; we will always be in touch . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez told that their guests often send text messages if they are gone to greet them or to report her about the course of their journey .
she explained that their Christian belief was the drive of their work .
&quot; they don &apos;t know much about Africa , but their guests have brought it , chickens like in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps here well known , but it is not the only Fun@@ ken hope for the migrants that travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
at the other end of the city a dead road leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ ela .
these winter have taken Valencia and his family migrants at their little house .
he is polic@@ emen and has established that the B@@ usti@@ ff to numerous African migrants are too expensive too expensive .
&quot; he began to help them to get a reasonable price , then he has offered them his house for a dollar a night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , 25 people are there , mainly shar@@ ti@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; some sleeping on blan@@ kets on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a kitchen outside . &quot;
Valen@@ ela declar@@ es that he knows what the guests pass through .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he tells . &quot; &quot; I have experienced what she experienced . &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . this is the reason why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived for three years , he was transferred to the United States after a raid . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants that travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open doors to their homes for them . &quot;
JosÃ© Antonio Cord@@ ova Mel@@ Ã©@@ n@@ de@@ z tells me that he had escap@@ ed in Honduras with his wife and his three children to people who wanted to make money out of him without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he has asked for an accommodation and a well @-@ known , an om@@ ou@@ trag@@ eous one has offered her roof . &quot;
some months later the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
in the courses the travelers consult their phones .
&quot; a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , much of Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that their house is full , but it is also nostal@@ g@@ ically , because of those who have gone . &quot;
like a proud grand@@ mother they wo@@ und in their album with numerous photos .
&quot; there are one of her daughter with African hair fle@@ ets which you made a Kun@@ din , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travellers more , boy and Old . &quot;
she laugh@@ s sad while she is giving me a short time .
&quot; Y@@ a se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; she repeated every time . &quot; &quot; they are already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app .
&quot; a check @-@ point for personal communication instruments in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter @-@ users , cost@@ umes , etc . &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , a ethnic minorities region in the west of China , are forced to install a spy@@ ware on their hand@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 , the Handy @-@ User in the Ti@@ an@@ shan District of the city Uru@@ m@@ qi a cell notifications in which it shows the district government , a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; &quot; Web Cle@@ aning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the press release , the App is said to get access to terrorist information . &quot;
but on the authorities put the app to use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
&quot; according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonom@@ ous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture , because they had installed the app , messages with a private We@@ chat group . &quot;
&quot; in the communication of the police , the app must determine the sources and the distribution paths of terrorists and follow , together with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ow website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective performance with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ ang@@ su Tele@@ com . &quot;
&quot; the main function is the block@@ ages of porno@@ graphic Web sites , by online fraud , Tro@@ jan@@ ets and ph@@ ishing sites to make users pay attention , how much time they spend online , and to control their own home network . &quot;
this app with the filter for min@@ ors should help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in a variety of ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote &quot; state actors or even hack@@ ers may be capable to manip@@ ulate the home network of a person or to ste@@ al it . &quot;
this introduction is consistent with other measures to take control of digital activities in this region .
&quot; while reports on digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China usually focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often d@@ ush@@ ers for those who live in remote , fri@@ ght@@ ered ethnic minorities such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to limit dis@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in the conflict zones , the authorities often arrange extreme tick and surveillance measures , as well as rout@@ in@@ em@@ ian Internet . &quot;
&quot; this published on Twitter bas@@ ing Media @-@ Out@@ let &quot; Images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( Terms ) , published news from a ch@@ eckpoint , on the polic@@ emen of the residents op@@ tionally elabor@@ ated whether they had installed the surveillance app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
mobile messages required that people install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected at a ch@@ eckpoint with a device without this software , they could be det@@ ained up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a backl@@ ash for technological development .
&quot; they have forced people to use devices that are intended for older people , to use . &quot;
this is a form of cap@@ tivity through the rest of the uter@@ ine technology .
we are back in ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( merch@@ ant ) journ@@ alism ) , also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang manual , from which the software can lift the password of a Windows operating system and thus receives unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot;
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang are computers and mobil@@ es in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang to electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is possibly a reaction to the instructions of the city @-@ party Council to minim@@ ize the distribution of illegal contents .
&quot; all governmental authorities , authorities and with the party connected facilities including universities and research institutes are oblig@@ ated to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office when operation of their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a current report of Freedom House , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned this new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Uru@@ m@@ qi . a regulation with the assignment to all residents and entrepreneurs , up to 1 August their &quot; personal ID cards , hand@@ ys , external drives , portable dis@@ ks , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at local police . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; to identify and destroy the personality rights of Uru@@ m@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole series of other possible price , including those that relate to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
sleep or death , part 1 : everything shake after death &quot;
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane &apos;s experiences in an Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far away from our blue , virtual world you look at and adjust@@ ing that you are quite alone in a place where all the most important things have disappeared . &quot;
&quot; everything has been resolved and un@@ resolved , and revealed a truth that is clearly recogni@@ z@@ able , both inside and outside . &quot;
one that makes her name every honour .
one who settled in a list of feelings and expres@@ sing down no met@@ aphor .
&quot; but when you get the reality again and you look behind the scenes - beyond an act@@ ress , the beautiful scenes and the performers - turn the characters in beings of flesh and blood , and all disappear after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts solve themselves in smoke and you become aware of your existence , even if the Earth are on the axis of the un@@ hei@@ r . you will realise that you have caught up here between the walls that your parents , and before them have built your grand@@ parents , stone to stone . &quot;
&quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but that &apos;s not yet to be &quot; &quot; my lesson &quot; , &quot; as the boss of the security service it form@@ ulated - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure . &quot;
he presented his power over us by giving even the easi@@ est concepts destruction we know .
&quot; five young people were destroyed during a peaceful protests , such as weed from the beautiful garden of our revolution . &quot;
&quot; it consists of so that the city is broken by the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; all the districts , only my own is not . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , reg@@ in@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city that appears until the arter@@ ies with state safety and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the third night things had cal@@ med a so@@ othing , after the power supply in the quarters were stopped . &quot;
&quot; I bur@@ nt the silence by calling several times &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; of my house roof . &quot;
I listen@@ ed to my voice through the silence .
few minutes later some of my friends felt bra@@ ve enough to come together .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we joined us to a glorious picture , which was full of expectations and fully filled . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you are aware that you share the Spirit out of the lamp , but it &apos;s not interested in Ger@@ ing@@ sten . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; makes you ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot;
he put on .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low , nothing can give you your voice , after you have given you all the way to the office of the safety service from the body . &quot;
I came there .
&quot; the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an was there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now also . &quot;
&quot; the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to speak : &quot; &quot; let me hear , as you write &apos;@@ All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar , or you are only cour@@ ageous enough to cry , if we are not nearby . &quot;
its h@@ ated eyes set out on me .
and you tell you what to look in my eyes and not on the ground !
what I did then did nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building . &quot;
perhaps it was on my fol@@ ly ; perhaps at the revolution .
&quot; I was so safe to me , when I said , &apos; I would not have thought that you have already forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; and I believe I have never heard to look into your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the short@@ est entertainment that could have such fat@@ al consequences for me , and yet regret not a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; lies him in individual , and his father equal to it . &quot;
&quot; his father is equal to it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the design of this cur@@ sed form is still in the nose .
&quot; he was exposed to a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a se@@ el@@ ic torture , which I was abandoned . &quot;
I pass the farm .
&quot; in the first office , I leave everything I tr@@ apped with me . &quot;
&quot; afterwards , through the farm and into the second office , which leads through a gear to the single cells . &quot;
I predic@@ ted all the details exactly before I serve the space .
&quot; otherwise , they probably have a bigger cell to me this time . &quot;
&quot; I have to share it with only one another prison@@ er , and may immediately put me away , without how else to wait for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes , who felt like a whole life left the official the cell , and I access to an old proven communication method : having to beat against the wall . &quot;
I learned that my m@@ ellen@@ rade is a &quot; Er@@ sth@@ r@@ ling &quot; .
after a long hes@@ itation he answered me ultimately .
&quot; apparently , in none of the surrounding cells was a prestigious man aged man who looks similar to me and &quot; &quot; doctor &quot; &quot; is called &quot; &quot; doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the perfect darkness there is no mark@@ ings to me , and doctors are here not ; we are all just numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice sounds similar to my sounds ? &quot;
all answers are connected to its existence .
perhaps he was caught in one of the big cells .
perhaps he will immediately hear .
&quot; the agent had insur@@ ed to me , they would be shared him if I stay . &quot;
V@@ ek &apos;@@ nil@@ ash
&quot; I would like to have had a bird @-@ eu@@ che to sell all these cro@@ ws , who lab@@ elled themselves in the morning in the garden of my head . &quot;
&quot; from the distance I hear it still &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be about 10 am in the evening , always at this time the writer , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black is the colour of the de@@ pot , until I saw the yellow light , which made us the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Don@@ ner &quot; , &quot; reference to 13th S@@ ure of the Quran ) . &quot;
they are here to hear sounds .
&quot; this was the secret to protect the state security before us , and to prevent the betra@@ ying and terrorists in us , they talk in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ ite dial@@ ect - thus they played their con@@ fes@@ sions and black@@ out the close look of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house which here is not a country ; it is a cur@@ se , which they call co@@ existence to transform the cri@@ minals of their kne@@ es into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I super@@ vised the lock , and tre@@ ffe on Abu I@@ mad , a sl@@ ender and literally man ; at least he comes to me . &quot;
&quot; he begins a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the facial expres@@ sions , who are wr@@ apped : &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start as much more important with your life as you can join this day and to protest the demonstrations as soon as an end . &quot;
I rep@@ lied not .
&quot; I have acc@@ ust@@ omed to answer , not to answer . &quot;
&quot; I can really no longer tell , when Bel@@ ts and be@@ ats have become a friendly conversation for me to become an ordinary communication . &quot;
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
&quot; any voice in me said that I had to get used to me or put it used to be pun@@ ished , although I did nothing to make this punishment . &quot;
an punishment in all its diversity .
its command is to pl@@ uck me as much meat as possible from the body .
he is called the loving &quot; gest@@ ation . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube that probably dates back to the clo@@ ak .
your Hen@@ ker and rejo@@ ice in your par@@ ishes .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure you with it , and you can not with@@ hold your typ@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; my typ@@ ing fell to him not enough , which is why it inter@@ change@@ able by a cable . &quot;
&quot; during my first deposit , I asked if the medi@@ ator had worked before as a g@@ arb@@ age dump or whether this was one of the normal working equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had four cables to present each other , in order to present us from their point of view , great in@@ vention of a huge Kab@@ els . &quot;
within a single hour three of them rarely happens when I was still in the row .
&quot; I had lost all my feeling in my body - and my voice , which is why I listen@@ ed to . &quot;
&quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er remarkable the cooling , and found no free@@ zer for it , which is why he serves as a neighb@@ our to an electrical connection . &quot;
&quot; flow through my entire body , enough to feed my entire neighborhood . &quot;
&quot; my semi @-@ Nude body , which lay down on the ground , was the perfect black@@ board . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was again there .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been so about midnight .
&quot; I decided to lay down again , let &apos;s say again ; we say that was my only option . &quot;
&quot; a few hours for@@ got , which came to me like minutes . &quot;
then the call to dawn .
the door opens and the dawn meets the space &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; I answered with the voice of a exhausted youths : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father has to worry . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and away you , you will be moved . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always been released .
where do they lead me ? !

Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigar@@ ette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was recorded by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sp@@ ends the bulk of his time ; sometimes he tubes to his screen , and again to his couch . &quot;
but one can rely on it is a cigar@@ ette between his fingers or his with ni@@ cot@@ ine lips .
&quot; he lives at the top floor of his family house which had been forced to them since 1967 ; the year , in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family to escape from their village in Palestine in which she had lived as rocky ( about : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist that faces the conservative majority , and its ancient opinions about gender ma@@ ins , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rapid music . &quot;
&quot; with his music , often dealing with topics like Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , it also calls for the core of the whole Arab world , but also in cities that are rich in Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted by boundaries in his thinking , and he can suffer according to their own statement with people who suffer the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign interventions in countries like Iraq , the Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he is not open to the American foreign policy , he defe@@ ats a special slope against the American foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war areas , something that was born with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees &quot; of the second generation - he described himself , even if he was born in Jordan , and has never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think of my own living conditions so , &quot; stres@@ ses H@@ d@@ ai@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a person , while in water the n@@ ests are st@@ amped in two cups ; it is the holy month of Ram@@ ad@@ an ; in this time it is intended for Muslims , from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the j@@ ord@@ anic law also imp@@ acted that public consumption of food during Ram@@ ad@@ an is illegal .
&quot; obviously H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness for this , to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee at a sen@@ sing hot j@@ it@@ ag has little with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the battles of the hot coffee and the sw@@ elling of the K@@ ent cigar@@ ette in the nose is primarily of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially when one thro@@ ws a view to the neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is simply avo@@ ids to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ ad@@ an Water , to do not land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Federal Ministry of Jordan has said a appearance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some parliament@@ arians who support the Islamic Action Front - the Vene@@ tian branch of the Muslim Br@@ other@@ hood - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual Front@@ s@@ ang@@ ar@@ oos , Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o that speaks to the cultural and traditional standards of the country and the main reason for the concert . &quot;
&quot; the members and former press lecture in the Islamic coalition D@@ IMA Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert is &quot; just &quot; because of sexual orientation of the sc@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; many also asser@@ t the commitment of the band in affairs like the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world , be dangerous activ@@ ism , which represents the old legi@@ timacy of author@@ it@@ ary regime in the whole region . &quot;
&quot; in a public govern@@ ement m@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la the j@@ ord@@ an people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; , &quot; which continue to work &quot; for an intellectual and cultural plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement is likely not to be simply sei@@ zed Rh@@ et@@ ori@@ k , but in fact a more clearly noticeable reality in Jordan , which occurs in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs work clearly . &quot;
in 2016 h@@ ook H@@ d@@ ai@@ b traditional sex @-@ tern@@ or@@ men to Lei@@ be by having his vision of the fate of Arab women who have sex .
&quot; the image shows the sk@@ elet@@ on of a apparently sl@@ ed in@@ famous woman , their arms and legs to stretch up to the corners of the canvas . &quot;
&quot; she is surrounded by a red lake , perhaps the blood of the countless men who lost their lives by the hands of those who actually should trust them . &quot;
in Jordan the number of &quot; honor@@ ary mur@@ dered &quot; has left the official external side in Jordan .
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honor@@ ary mur@@ dered in 2016 reached its peak ; however , Jordan is missing , that Jordan is missing , in order to support women , victims of murder or domestic violence . &quot;
&quot; according to a law on contrac@@ eption from 1954 , women who are held at un@@ certain time in prison , and for their release is often a years of bureau@@ c@@ ratic effort , as well as the guarantee from the family , that the woman is nothing to happen . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is known for it , also not to rede@@ mp@@ ed topics in his country as a tab@@ u . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b hon@@ ed that his work is political , however , however , that he is his music , the full of explic@@ it references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , not of politics . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , Man . &quot;
&quot; I have entered politics , &quot; he says . &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; is the focus on poverty .
&quot; the list of the songs , which are politically politically , can be continued . &quot;
in March 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b released a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated many times :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market , in which one can get in his words , &quot; that is what you want &quot; - be faith or non @-@ belief , heter@@ o- or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; he noticed that hardly anyone in Jordan , on the rights of Schw@@ ls and readers , and that comments on equality between LGB@@ T@@ Q + -@@ individuals still were c@@ ens@@ ored in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b conducted an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an online programme of Ro@@ ya , in order to remember later that his comments were rounded out of the context , and his opinion were reported . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts , but was only a processed version , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is open to the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intoler@@ ance against homosexu@@ als do not speak of Islam . &quot;
&quot; he mentioned Abu Nu@@ what , a po@@ et of the eighth century , which still remained in memory thanks to its homo@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks : when Abu Nu@@ what should be working later on behalf of the cali@@ per , in the eighth century could write openly about homosexu@@ ality , why can Jordan won &apos;t be ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
in the H@@ ash@@ em@@ ite Kingdom there is nothing new that the government &apos;s attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive votes will be brought to silence .
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the j@@ ord@@ anic mess@@ engers took several former government members and members of the teacher &apos;s association , with the ration@@ ale , they had critical about comments in social media to soci@@ ate problems with which deeply root@@ ed in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , the concert H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to bring a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ an@@ ier . &quot;
&quot; for him , progress has been a continuous growth and kid@@ ney . Jordan has been des@@ per@@ ished for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - it looks like H@@ d@@ ai@@ b - consists of slow , bed@@ ding and inner changes . it is sure that these changes come from day to day at the heart of the Vene@@ tian society . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , as well , from an Arab world without intervention abroad . &quot;
&quot; he not only dre@@ amed to bring his work up to Bag@@ hd@@ ad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of them to experience them . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region will help with music , art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bom@@ bs , spreading uni@@ tions and on artificial way . at least , he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; until it is far , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue to res@@ ist and therefore also res@@ um@@ ed resistance . &quot;
&quot; this report was facilit@@ ated by the Pul@@ it@@ zer Center on Crisis Report@@ ing , the A@@ man as Student Fel@@ low . &quot;
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
&quot; these big , ex@@ trav@@ ag@@ ant warri@@ or are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the neb@@ ula Festival .
&quot; one susp@@ ected that there is a version of Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . a further theory came across for over a thousand years and from time , in the Ar@@ mies from the West in the northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , in the knee . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to score some great seats , that &apos;s why we have a great view . &quot;
one can only imagine how big these parts are ...
&quot; a Community center in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) . &quot;
I have long been looking for me to see the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en on : two fix@@ tures are just to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only True - and still a breathtaking way to spend its summer : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer@@ festival in the north of the country .
I was there and I looked at the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high fixed wag@@ on was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

&quot; rarely were outer appearance and body care as important as in this story , because they help to maintain the Peru@@ vian youth from crime and to promote a legi@@ timate profession like the hair@@ style . &quot;
&quot; el Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to the historical center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where road consuming and illegal drugs field are daily . &quot;
&quot; in April 2017 , a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for a@@ esthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , appearance and therefore also the sophisticated hair@@ styles of famous sports as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led that becoming more stand@@ alone in the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers you can post this elabor@@ ate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the un@@ preced@@ ented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , even has an annual event , the competition of the Fris@@ ce Bat@@ alla de Barber@@ os , who has been taking place since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there are experts against each other , to show who from them can create the ex@@ zent@@ ris@@ est L@@ ooks , as one can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Barber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to convince young people to share their weapons against hair@@ dres@@ sing tools , instead of finding a training in the hair@@ dres@@ ser , which allows them to find work . &quot;
motivated by this activity and the following possibilities have seen do@@ z@@ ens of young people that they can take a job which is currently in fashion .
the school offered before the special training course in March and reported about some of their achievements :
&quot; in 1995 we were the only professional school in the municipality and the district , which we are very proud of because of love for the children we have built this educational community . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the registered version of the article &quot; &quot; Lov@@ ing &quot; &quot; for gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ap@@ ers &quot; &quot; which has published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot;
this article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to man we know ?
&quot; is it not yet much more important , people who feel the spread of affection ? &quot;
&quot; this question went to the two young Colum@@ bian activists , Leonardo P@@ Ã¡r@@ rag@@ a from the foundation of Bog@@ ot@@ Art and C@@ risti@@ an Pal@@ aci@@ os of the Young @-@ Youth Foundation ( letters for Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ liation ) , the young people to write gu@@ ardi@@ ans letters . &quot;
&quot; only recently , her land was the place of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to her part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace agreement with the gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ab@@ ew@@ ays F@@ ARC ( English : revolutionary forces of Columbus ) in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; international has been the under@@ statement of the peace of peace , as important that the Colom@@ bian President JosÃ© Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize in the Nobel Peace Prize . &quot;
&quot; but in front of the Kolum@@ nen , however , there is a long way until you can speak of a real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; gu@@ err@@ illa struggles for many years have lived in illegal warehou@@ ses , and around the clock were exposed to their arms in themselves and now have to integrate themselves into life as civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society in turn , which had become deeply acc@@ ust@@ omed to life in fear and in some cases , they have now to record them into their ranks and support them in building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and C@@ risti@@ an were convinced that the young colum@@ bi@@ ans had to combine and help in the integration process .
and this is exactly what they did : to now have written thousands of young people letters - lov@@ emaking to former gu@@ er@@ ill@@ usions to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign are 69@@ 00 letters - one for each former gu@@ ardi@@ ans who will then be delivered personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the letters of reconciliation was born on the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Prize , which was held in February 2017 in Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ . there , Leonardo and C@@ risti@@ an had the opportunity to speak shortly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ ar@@ th@@ i , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; stated that we love the people we love , to write off the Valentine &apos;s Day of love , but those forgotten they need much necessary . &quot;
&quot; he tar@@ pau@@ lin , he told his love with people in this year his love with people who needed the most urgent fear . &quot;
&quot; so the plan came to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of F@@ ARC who now find their place in society and build a new life . &quot; the letters are prepared to make the dis@@ course of a war story to a common history of peace , &quot; they say . &quot;
&quot; up to date , more than 2000 letters have been collected in the framework of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Columbus , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ ic@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ . &quot;
I have never thought that someone would for@@ give me &apos;
the first 500 letters have been handed over on 19 March in one of the UN @-@ bearings in the Cal@@ don@@ o region .
&quot; a group of 40 students at the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ al administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Stiftung Bog@@ ot@@ Art travel@@ ed in the camp to learn the letters personally . &quot;
&quot; the members of the F@@ ARC stood up , as they had done it earlier to form@@ ulate the commands of their leaders . &quot;
&quot; but this time they received no commands , but letters full of sub@@ jug@@ ation of people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very turbul@@ ent moment for all involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings can be run through just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that is between &quot; , &quot; about the politicians &quot; &quot; Manuela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
Sandra Par@@ ra , a collabor@@ ator of the govern@@ or of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , this unforgettable experience is so : &quot;
after we passed the letters we led me a former fighter by the camp of the Gu@@ er@@ illa fighters .
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut , in which the gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ac@@ ute live ) , I saw a gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ap@@ er who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go down , because beside him on the bed was a M@@ GL pom@@ egran@@ ate , a dead@@ ly weapon in the dor@@ mit@@ ory . &quot;
&quot; I said to him nevertheless , &quot; &quot; hello , what are they doing straight ? &quot; he answered , &quot; I answered a letter that someone has written me . &quot;
it is a very beautiful and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never in my life someone wrote something so beautiful , so I answered it . &quot; &quot; I suddenly had the t@@ ears about the che@@ eks . &quot;
I h@@ ug@@ ged him very firm and sat down beside the pom@@ egran@@ ate .
&quot; perhaps he was the war , it was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this struggles , and wanted to help him to write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he never expected anything else from life as war . the F@@ ARC , was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers in front of the fam@@ er@@ to@@ d . &quot; &quot; I would never thought that someone would be given for my fault . &quot;
&quot; now I know that there is a society out there , which is waiting with open arms to us . &quot;
until now I just learned how I have to deal with weapons .
&quot; but now where peace prev@@ ails , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new votes
&quot; for the opening , students and some leaders of F@@ ARC came together to a discussion summit . &quot;
the students were all grown up as a war and the F@@ ARC already existed in the dark .
&quot; therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views over the peace process : &quot; many years , we have experienced the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can help to shape society in this country . &quot;
&quot; for a goal of these sizes , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
&quot; to hear these people who have never found hearing and had no choice , and to recognize that people that I have often seen as monsters and even hate who were fil@@ med by their living conditions and their environment , was very pain@@ ful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality , in which the country lives , does me hurt . &quot;
&quot; but it tr@@ illi@@ ed me that all men - also those who killed and so much damage to us , and give us a smile and a hug . &quot;
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the com@@ mander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ Ã­@@ o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Arch@@ bishop of the city of Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot;
the Colum@@ bian was made that after the dra@@ fting peace would reign .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as it is inequality , hunger and a lack of education , healthcare and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to raise the weapons to raise themselves and to protest for their rights . and that is also completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we of the F@@ ARC are now putting on peace , to a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; therefore we call all the def@@ ender of peace , regardless of which race , religion or ideology they belong@@ ed to rise above all those who dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , do our contribution and bring victim , as we know from our own experience , that nothing is easy . for those among us who are taking life as the basis of existence , will be many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; hom@@ os@@ exual and que@@ er people who live in the Cau@@ cas@@ ian region , are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and tor@@ tion . &quot;
with fri@@ ght activists have experienced the coverage of the last months about the persecution of emerging men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but the threat , which depends on how a d@@ amo@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ worth about the dor@@ sal LGB@@ T@@ Q community is not only dependent on night . &quot;
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a tran@@ ss@@ exu@@ ell woman from Gro@@ sn@@ y , who shared some of her experiences and talked to us what is currently happening in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the LGB@@ TI legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conqu@@ ered the international Headlines , after several months ago , after reports were published , torture and killing que@@ er men in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gas@@ eta , which thre@@ w a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , who took sus@@ pic@@ king que@@ er men and put them into secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Sabrina , a trans@@ wife , was born in Gro@@ sn@@ y and grew up there . &quot;
since her childhood she felt that she was in reality a woman .
&quot; when she was er@@ ected , it was aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for them , so why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Ch@@ echn@@ ya came out of the intercourse of her Land@@ sf@@ rau , the hunt was opened on Sabrina . &quot;
&quot; from fear to her life , she moved to the USA . &quot;
Sabrina : I was active as an honor@@ ary hero@@ in at a human rights organisation .
one day was told me that anyone need my help .
&quot; it was a conversion of Dag@@ est@@ an , a trans@@ wife , which put in difficulties . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone made of whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it anywhere on the internet , with my telephone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his ch@@ ord friends , with the following message : &quot; then there is no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya , who can eliminate these shame ? &quot;
afterwards the photos of my documents made by the whole W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I was just there , a few steps from the back of my car , I heard a short@@ com@@ bo : &quot; here is a gift for you from your unc@@ le . &quot;
&quot; when I turned out , I feel something in my body , but I did nothing . &quot;
&quot; then I heard one set , but this time on the Che@@ ap : &quot; how long do you want the family to be dish@@ ed , du Sch@@ and@@ fl@@ eck ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I just know that there was a young man , no 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost the consciousness and wa@@ its last coming in the hospital again .
apparently some women had got everything and started to write .
the man was flying .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two sc@@ esses in my right pul@@ mon@@ ks .
OC media : in which hospitals are you laid - in the men or women ?
Sabrina : my documents are out@@ dated ; there is still my male name dr@@ on ; but the doctor for@@ got and put me to the women .
I am very grateful for this .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I got it with the fear ; it was a mus@@ li@@ er , a cas@@ ian name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him that he is respect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
in the last February I got dr@@ one .
&quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , stran@@ gers , some completely unknown . &quot;
this was the beginning of a night@@ stand .
my family was attended by neighbors and some distant relatives .
&quot; the required to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove , to prove that all that was a lie . &quot;
&quot; they asked absur@@ d demands : some told me , I could prove it by going through the streets ; others wanted that I did not change on the official television in Gro@@ sn@@ y and say that I had not changed my sex , that everything was just bad , and Photoshop . &quot;
I have body size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sabrina : it is still hard for her .
some older people spoke my mother on the road .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; You have brought a monster to the world that has not only embarrass@@ ed your family , but the entire Republic . &quot;
&quot; we can &apos;t stop you , because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
in my mother there was too much and she lay down a stri@@ ck about the neck .
luck@@ ily the neighbours came and saved them .
at the moment I had to switch to the apartment several times a day .
&quot; I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window there was a car with insul@@ ated fats and a number@@ ing plate with a 95 dr@@ ill . &quot;
&quot; after it was happening for the third time , it was clear that there was something laz@@ y . &quot;
my Human Rights of Human Rights are veri@@ fied the number@@ ing signs - it turned out that I was per@@ sec@@ uted .
OC Media : how did you hear ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for safety reasons I do not want to give their name price , but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with her help I left the land , but then I did something un@@ credi@@ ble . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before leaving Moscow I bought a new SI@@ M card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
&quot; I bought them , without delay , without exclusion , without everything . &quot;
I broke my old SI@@ M card and cast them into the tr@@ ash .
came at and check@@ ered into the hotel .
the number was registered to a stran@@ ger .
I put the SI@@ M card into my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you think not about , thou warm@@ est in security , only because you have left the country ? &quot;
our people already know in what place you do . you even know your room number .
just to prove it : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine ? !
this really was my room number .
OC Media : stand with your family still in contact ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we are not talking about the lov@@ emaking we are not talking , this is a tab@@ u@@ ary topic . &quot;
some traditional k@@ au@@ cas@@ ian elements are still in me .
&quot; so much I wish , this se@@ el@@ ic bar@@ ri@@ ere may not be overcome . &quot;
&quot; I always say that , as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with a camera , I actually give me trouble how the person remin@@ is@@ cent of her past - so remember my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who have stayed there ? &quot;
Sabrina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for the needed I needed current information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; I spoke with someone that has been lon@@ ely in Ar@@ gun , a half months in Ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; he told that during Ram@@ ad@@ an no man was arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ ad@@ an could hardly wait , and he closed a new wave . &quot;
possibly they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
&quot; so that I mean , they probably download the relative , these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand proof that the so called &quot; honour &quot; has experienced by blood co@@ ug@@ ging . &quot;
OC Media : are now still flo@@ ating men in these secrets ?
Sabrina : a friend of mine says there would be quite a lot .
&quot; if , then , above all those who have no rich relatives or have been dropped by their relatives , to ask for a fair@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they will be held there so that you can present them later as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say : should they be converted , they will show their body on TV and claim they would have attacked any village or military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people are not simply gone , but targeted ref@@ used to radi@@ alize themselves . &quot;
OC Media : is that only one mut@@ ation or do you have a source for this information ?
Sabrina : I just bore someone who was imprison@@ ed at a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard was grown .
there was then nothing new of them .
they just have taken them .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was self @-@ evident than these people were taken . &quot;
&quot; until now they were not presented as a ban@@ di@@ ten , so far there were no reports . we susp@@ ect that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why else would you have not allowed these people to shave yourself ?
&quot; do you know if these per@@ sec@@ utions and dism@@ is@@ sions of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , already in the past ? &quot;
Sabrina : I always carried my hair forever .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I believe that in 2003 I was already known quite Gro@@ sn@@ y when I lived there - and I never had any problems .
in Ernst !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the sh@@ aria was considered , I never had problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , at that time it was much more secure than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia originally wanted to lead us to the &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; , but in the St@@ one@@ age , we finally thre@@ w us back into the St@@ one@@ age . &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
Sabrina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were exhausted ; I had fallen colored eyelashes , carried the tube @-@ je@@ ans and short T@@ ops . &quot;
the security of the sh@@ aria never has an hair cur@@ ved .
&quot; before the Russian theatre in Gro@@ sn@@ y there was a place where every evening , especially at weekends , a whole group of people like me met . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several ben@@ ches were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , there met . &quot;
we have never been imag@@ ined .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a reduction : K@@ hard@@ a ma K@@ hard@@ a . that is : &quot; sp@@ otte not about the un@@ happiness of another . &quot;
&quot; you often say it to children , when the sick make themselves funny . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : so they just have their eyes closed before you , because they believed , they are sick ? &quot;
Sabrina : yes .
&quot; they have never sinn@@ ed , never bur@@ nt , and never be@@ aten . &quot;
OC media : how long did this Gn@@ est time stopped ?
Sabrina : so long until K@@ end@@ row came to the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Minister for prime minister , he began to speak on television over mor@@ als . &quot;
&quot; he did not talk about us , but forward about the behavior of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , one could feel like the people of the city began to change . &quot;
&quot; who had fl@@ aw@@ ed and yellow@@ ed , watching you at once with Arg@@ w@@ ohn . &quot;
in the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I was able to feel like the situation in the Republic is steadily wast@@ ed . &quot;
OC Media : what activity do you go now ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I won &apos;t have much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the USA not much .
&quot; apart from that , I still have active as activ@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; currently , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women . &quot;
communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize Te@@ et@@ re@@ ef , together , I accompanied them to the hospital and hel@@ fe to them to get food@@ cards . &quot;
I haven &apos;t been a cent for that .
I discovered these people themselves when I pray @-@ sor@@ row@@ ed down .
I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : wear a Hid@@ den ?
Sabrina : this is al@@ vid .
&quot; so , nature , that has nothing to do with religion at all . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ echn@@ ya , who want to know you with foam in front of the mouth , that there is no sw@@ oop with them . &quot;
&quot; the Dag@@ est@@ ans have which the cab@@ ard@@ iner have which , the Russians are also which ; on the whole planet there are - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I come from there , that is why it is unpleasant to hear sounds . &quot;
I got here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practic@@ ing Muslims which go into the mosque and during Ram@@ ad@@ an fa@@ sten - live with men .
&quot; you know , many thinking about Tran@@ si@@ denti@@ ty to men , the men love , and they believe that one changes his generation to make more intimate experiences . but that is a tru@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different types of feeling , to be exactly , different ways . &quot;
&quot; for me , it is the most important to feel in my own skin and not ash@@ amed for my body . &quot;
don &apos;t know if I have a partner or not .
sorry that I will be here so personally but my final intimate relationship is now longer than one year ago .
and I am not sad for this - I just know that I am now myself .

&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man called J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August decl@@ ined the des@@ perate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , the spot@@ light . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he d@@ welt in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the south @-@ west of Iran .
&quot; he suffered among anxiety , depression , and he ash@@ amed of his own hel@@ pless@@ ness that can come up for his own hel@@ pless@@ ness , the in@@ ability to work for his family , so Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ human rights groups that work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; one on YouTube shared video held the moments , after he had stir@@ red himself . &quot;
&quot; some people managed to delete the fl@@ ames again , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought into the Tal@@ eg@@ han@@ i Hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the bur@@ ns were so strong that doctors have nothing to do . &quot;
he died a short time later .
&quot; it was not the only su@@ icide , who took place in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and activists before place war@@ ns that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights announces that month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sh@@ ah@@ ab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : it was all family of family , who felt thanks to the persecution on the part of the Iranian government , hel@@ pl@@ ess and in@@ capable to im@@ itate their families and to work for a safe work . &quot;
Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , located in the most of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community , was sh@@ aken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult to fight against the native Arab population . &quot;
&quot; a century ago , the Arabic Ah@@ wa@@ z was a pre@@ domin@@ antly region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi mon@@ archy took over power and took great efforts to stop ethnic autonomy in all Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest in Iran prev@@ ailing oil and gas fields as well as some of the most valuable and most valuable areas for the Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy is developing only slow , and the local population gets only little of that wealth . &quot;
it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ form@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime ref@@ uses the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ Arabs , systematically jobs in local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry . &quot;
&quot; the government also has a variety of dem@@ ons built , the waters of the Arab areas in the Persian regions , where the provinces of Is@@ fah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie . &quot;
these dem@@ ons have led only to devast@@ ating the devast@@ ation in the region due to dry devast@@ ation and the local agriculture as well as the fish and pal@@ ms industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab ar@@ az@@ zi youths now rose to 81 % .
&quot; Moh@@ ammed Moh@@ ammed P@@ ur , the Irish @-@ General Director for cooper@@ atives , work and social welfare , that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who completed a job that completed primary school , 55 % a further school and 45 % of a university degree . &quot;
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
&quot; Kar@@ im Doh@@ im@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of self @-@ mur@@ ders among the young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i men . &quot;
&quot; Doh@@ im@@ i said , that particularly unemployment has become increasingly worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of Ah@@ wa@@ z new an@@ xi@@ ous ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recovery process : &quot;
&quot; as functional and institutions , not for Arab labor force , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i will spread the access to labour possibilities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national rebel@@ lion of young Arabs , and forc@@ ing them to earn their livel@@ ih@@ ood outside their homeland . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to hide their performances and sur@@ name to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i to hide and so con@@ stitut@@ ed , since even Arab names in the workplace are not toler@@ ated , because the speaking of the Arabic language or the wearing Arab clothing . &quot;
&quot; given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i must end@@ ure , propose human rights activists , before the location explo@@ sive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world will wake up and take note of it .
the main reason for su@@ icide is untreated depression .
Depression is treat@@ able and su@@ icide is avo@@ idable .

&quot; the following article is a revised version of the opinion , published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as website . the article was the subject of several discussions , where many different positions came to expression . &quot;
you can read in the comments under the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am not femin@@ ist , many women react - especially white women who call themselves as an inter@@ disciplinary femin@@ ists - with fr@@ ust . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even place well @-@ thought scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally have all femin@@ ist * inside .
&quot; for example , women nowadays , despite equal education will still earn less money than men . &quot;
&quot; that women are still under stric@@ test observation , if it is about what they are going to do with their body . &quot;
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women sooner or later relate to a smooth ceiling , and that discrimination based on gender equality still moves through the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all of this is aware of me and known .
I am convinced that and I have double and triple among them .
I am a black woman .
&quot; yet , if I come to talk on skin @-@ color , on black transi@@ tions women , on black transi@@ tions women , on black women in the LGB@@ TI community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mentioned , on which way we have physically , se@@ el@@ ic and verbal ass@@ aul@@ ted , both inside and outside the femin@@ ist movement , decide to mention many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ s@@ ect@@ oral femin@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; but nevertheless all agree that women - all women - together should come together to sing &quot; their voices , and &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya , my Lord &apos; to sing &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t want to talk about it , in addition to sexual violence , a institution@@ alized form r@@ acial violence indicates that we are exposed black women on two fold . &quot;
&quot; or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ es , and origin of origin less deserve as white men and women . &quot;
that black girl and girls with a migration background are referred to as white girl because of obvious integration problems .
&quot; or that women in black sp@@ ears and women are exposed to a higher risk to suffer from domestic violence and violence in partnership , as white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand I want all women to have all men and all men of any skin colour . on the other hand , I can &apos;t connect the same rights as black woman ; on the other hand I can &apos;t consider myself as black woman who refuse to consider inj@@ usti@@ ces in their thinking that relate to both gender and skin colour . &quot;
&quot; I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my membership in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented spher@@ es , who always rejected me and countless other black women and again . &quot;
&quot; So@@ jour@@ ner be@@ kl@@ ed 18@@ 51 in her speech : &quot; &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; and I also d@@ ess me , an ideology prev@@ ail@@ ed , in which the black woman is in historical ways a decent and mar@@ gin@@ alized beings . &quot;
&quot; I ref@@ uses me to connect my group@@ ings , which also absor@@ b our customs and customs to advance their ego@@ cent@@ ric program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer attempt to submit white women the importance of over@@ cutting of skin colour and sex . for some of them will continue to do the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to consume a better . &quot;
&quot; although the intercultural femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different deaths as a home and from the white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name . &quot;
&quot; I go before , releas@@ ing me fully from femin@@ ism and conclude me the movement of the W@@ om@@ an@@ ism that was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman in life , instead of bringing me a white @-@ femin@@ ist para@@ dig@@ m that is so stub@@ born as a new phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; now it is more important than ever , that we can define black women to our own ideas and enter into the spher@@ es that are created by us for us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ c@@ ana wom@@ anism : Rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing ourselves ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves , in which they are totally safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical , and even the spiritual elements can be hon@@ ored , which can be the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ s@@ ect@@ al femin@@ ists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after they read these lines , please feel about the hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected . &quot;
in a wom@@ an@@ ist environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures because in this para@@ dig@@ m .
I will be recognized because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a part of this para@@ dig@@ m .
&quot; I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life neither over@@ cast , nor ignored . &quot;

&quot; this post by Tod@@ d Reu@@ b@@ old was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about international efforts to resolve environmental problems . &quot;
in the context of a content sharing agreement this article will be published here again .
&quot; again and again the Nab@@ il Mus@@ a over the past 7 years - mostly with surf@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern through the Kur@@ dist@@ an area in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations . &quot;
&quot; in this documentation of Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow Mus@@ a who explains her relationship to the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church . &quot;
&quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river we had lost than I was a child , &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of du@@ ms , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - to protect the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video Mus@@ a summar@@ izes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question , &quot; if we had no water more , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was produced for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , in Iraq and multimedi@@ al journ@@ alis@@ tin , produced , filter@@ ed and edited . &quot;

most names have been modified to protect the persons concerned .
&quot; a police com@@ miss@@ ar said Ad@@ a B@@ Ã¡@@ ez said that she has nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , its ex@@ partner who has become against violent . &quot;
&quot; since the end of its relationship was a little time passed and the police said , their statement would be put into the acts , but more could not do . &quot;
&quot; as another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed because of abuse , also the acoustic indic@@ ator of Ad@@ a B@@ Ã¡@@ ez nothing . &quot;
a few days later the second woman moved their ad .
breaking the devil of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women at all display an indication , they generally receive no support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also dependent on the men who are mis@@ erable . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence being victims of violence in general . &quot;
content 1 b@@ lows and Statisti@@ c 2 In@@ visible Mis@@ cell@@ ings and a legal system that un@@ ni@@ mm@@ t@@ 3 pl@@ ays laws : good approach to lack of implementation and statistics
&quot; it is difficult to determine how many women really are negoti@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researchers for Gen@@ ent@@ ru@@ Ã³n y E@@ studios , a socio @-@ scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; there are various statements and reports that will not even demonstrate the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
but the numbers available are al@@ arm@@ ing .
&quot; in 2015 , in 2015 the district mandate of 9@@ 600 ads went up to domestic violence against domestic violence . at 70 % of it , it was about violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ads were joined by women .
there were more than 5000 displays because of domestic violence in the peace of peace . there came 86 % of the ads of women .
&quot; in the ads spoke 40 % of women , that they have been physically negoti@@ ated , 55 % of women spoke of mental abuse . &quot;
these statistics are not showing the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay .
&quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ardi will actually appear only a few of these crimes . &quot; &quot; on every woman who are rei@@ m@@ bur@@ sed in Paraguay due to psych@@ ic abuse , come 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; every woman who are rei@@ m@@ bur@@ sed because of physical failure , come two women who do not do this , they stated at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is no own criminal off@@ ence , the law enforcement authorities may not be appropri@@ ately documented how many women are mur@@ dered by their current or former partners each year . &quot;
&quot; only until August 2016 , journalists , at least 12 cases of women &apos;s su@@ icide in the country . &quot;
coordin@@ ator of human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were mur@@ dered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to its estimates , in Paraguay all ten days a woman dies because of violence through men . &quot;

invisible Mis@@ cell@@ aneous and a judicial system that doesn &apos;t matter
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z the firm friend of Carlos Vera was , he insi@@ sted that she called the name of all their former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning they didn &apos;t really wanted it , but then after . this should be it forever . &quot;
&quot; today , Mari@@ ana 28 years old and no longer carried together with Carlos . but two years ago , she carried out the psych@@ ic violence against women and at the same time most recogni@@ z@@ able forms of violence against women and at the same time most recogni@@ z@@ able : &quot;
I had never thought that I would have been victims of abuse .
&quot; when I have read it earlier , I always thought that the only women happen to be mist@@ aken , because they dec@@ ei@@ ve themselves of violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that I would never happen that .
Mari@@ ana us@@ eless social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name , they wrote contributions on Facebook where she described his belong@@ ings and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated it isolated . &quot;
&quot; many people rep@@ lied to their contributions , including Carlos even . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ically , whether he ever had the hand for them and ref@@ used to conc@@ ede that its behavior was a form of failure . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why they had fallen upon the so long of Carlos and did not let him go before . &quot;
it seemed almost as they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least had a certain fellow blame .
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , which dates back to Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay , to prove that their former partner they mis@@ use them . &quot;
&quot; Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te cre@@ o ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) , which consists of women who are all victims of abuse . &quot;
&quot; in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listening to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case all began with psych@@ ic abuse .
&quot; their wealth@@ y partner , it finally managed to convince them that it was worth@@ less . &quot;
then he started to beat them .
&quot; Vict@@ ori@@ as indicators have remained without a result and also of their relatives , she received no support . &quot;
&quot; it carried out a process against its former partners who developed into an im@@ penetr@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country in which it mainly went to money , power and influence of their former partner . &quot;
Education : laws : good approach to lack of implementation
&quot; in Paraguay , there are many laws which are very good , but not used . &quot;
&quot; the adver@@ t of missions is a way full of resist@@ ors and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ciary , &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ aur@@ i , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees big problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen parliament was discussed in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen parliament , which was known under the has@@ ht@@ ag # Por@@ ell@@ as ( # FÃ¼r@@ st ) . &quot;
this has@@ ht@@ ag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ Less ) are part of a campaign on Twitter , which is supported by Am@@ nest@@ y International . &quot;
&quot; the original design of the law considers that Fem@@ izi@@ d sees to a peculi@@ ar off@@ ence continu@@ ance to explain and t@@ oug@@ her , as it is already in the neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia . &quot;
&quot; thus , the legislation has changed in some points to also gain the MPs for the law that advoc@@ ates the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions , who are currently in Paraguay in Paraguay and are pun@@ ished with up to five years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the original bill was planned , the bulk of the ( bureau@@ c@@ ratic and economic ) of proced@@ ural expenses constitute the victims of violence at present themselves , if they just want to get display and get a safe place to place the state . &quot;
Ech@@ aur@@ i argu@@ ed that the law is not effective if the leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ors do not provide adequate financial resources for this :
&quot; in Paraguay , abuse is seen as part of inter@@ human relationships . &quot;
&quot; here a re@@ thinking must take place , so that violence is no longer considered something Nor@@ mal . &quot;
&quot; who@@ ever best@@ owed with this facts , makes him guilty and contributes to that the perpet@@ rators are dav@@ on@@ ward . &quot;
&quot; we have to refund as long , to abuse , no longer considered normal . &quot;
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Sen@@ ate . previously , parts of the law have been changed . however , among other things , a passage was stag@@ gering that the partners called in cases of domestic violence against reconciliation . &quot;
the opinions about the changes are going apart .
the section concerning reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for ag@@ gres@@ sor to attack his sacrifice .
&quot; the str@@ ing@@ ling of words &quot; gender &quot; , &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law is considered a great return . &quot;

independent media in O@@ man a year after pro@@ hibition of a newspaper continue to attack attacks
&quot; this website was closed by a decision of the &quot; &quot; Information@@ for &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the sover@@ eign newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than one year ago , the om@@ orian authorities have closed the independent Arab@@ ian newspaper Az@@ am@@ n due to their reporting about corruption in the sul@@ tan . &quot;
&quot; You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he was a one @-@ year sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and tried later , but they were later free . &quot;
&quot; O@@ man has been governed by Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us ib@@ n S@@ aid , who came to power after he had his father , S@@ aid ib@@ n T@@ aim@@ ur , through a state empire . &quot;
&quot; since then , he dres@@ sed , next to his role as the only Sult@@ an , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Defence Minister , Minister of Defence , Minister of Ministers , Minister of the Supre@@ me Council for the planning and president of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the rule of sul@@ tan is characterized by the ten@@ acious effort of security forces , in particular of domestic secrets , public freedoms , including press freedom , to restri@@ ct access to human rights , independent journalists , blog@@ gers and other activists , to be sh@@ y and liable . &quot;
&quot; the authorities limit a peaceful and legi@@ timate activities in the field of human rights systematically and hin@@ ders citizens , also activists , their views about the public affairs of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n , its closure , and the det@@ ention three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country . &quot;
&quot; Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , which has been reported in 2007 about corruption in O@@ man ( an absolute mon@@ archy ) , until it was forbidden by the authorities in August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amari , Chief Editor of Az@@ am@@ n , firmly , after in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 , a article entitled &quot; &quot; high @-@ level parties &quot; &quot; was the judi@@ ciary in the judi@@ ciary and the interference of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was arrested , member of the deadline , charged by the ISS on the Special Department and upon his arrival by the security guard . &quot;
on 9 August 2016 the ISS joined the Vice @-@ chief editor You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j established after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is Festival as Chief Editor .
&quot; the paper was closed at un@@ certain time after the information officer had given the statement that the publication and distribution of the newspaper on any way , including online , starting from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 the first trial in Mas@@ k@@ at took place in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ amari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i . &quot;
the Court condem@@ ned the three journalists to pris@@ als and also passed the final closing of the newspaper .
&quot; Al @-@ Ma@@ amari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condem@@ ned because of the disorder of public order , &quot; mis@@ use of the Internet &quot; and &quot; sub@@ mer@@ ing of the state of the state . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a publication of a publication and constitu@@ ent for guilty . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ amari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three @-@ year warran@@ ts and money stra@@ ins at the amount of 3000 om@@ orian finishes ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . moreover , a one @-@ year vocational training ban was negoti@@ ated against the two journalists . &quot;
&quot; Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year of prison and a cash penalty in the amount of 1000 finishes ( 2600 US dollars ) , after having been a threat to the dis@@ semination of material that could be a threat to public order . &quot;
&quot; for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was set up a deposit in the amount of 5000 om@@ orian finishes ( 13 000 US dollars ) , and he was released on 22 August 2016 in the port of the port . &quot;
&quot; the appeal Court said Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , condem@@ ned Al @-@ Ha@@ j a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ amari led to six months of prison . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ amari was released on 10 April 2017 for the prison of his six@@ teenth sentence in Mas@@ k@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j continues to be prison in prison where he was arrested his sentence .
&quot; the Ap@@ pe@@ al Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information , the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in spite of the decision of the court , Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper looks still exposed to attacks by the om@@ orian government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January the information officer sent a statement , with which the closes of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the exchange Minister personally signed a further statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and thus the ministers introduced a further time against the decision of the appeal , publishing the newspaper again . &quot;
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where in O@@ man has been viol@@ ated the press freedom .
&quot; for further inj@@ uries , for example , the closure of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent Online Newspaper of the country , its operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the continuous closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the det@@ ention of the journalist al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ orian authorities are still not ready to make an end to the extensive violation of press freedom . &quot;
the Golf @-@ Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ orian authorities on : &quot;
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j promp@@ tly and un@@ condition@@ ally release ;
2 . a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper to create their journalists of their work ;
3 . protect freedom of press in the country and
&quot; 4 . under all circumstances to ensure that human rights activists and journalists in O@@ man can imp@@ ose their right human rights work , and without fear of failure , including judicial exercise . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it Sm@@ er 2016 in Zam@@ bia , figure takes place with its consent . &quot;
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned at all or not mentioned at all times . this is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
&quot; for the need to run on @-@ site medical research there are two reasons : for an ab@@ sent in the offer of global health benefits , many drugs and vacc@@ ines which c@@ eil@@ ings a special medical need on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and mal@@ aria have considerable effects in the poorest countries of Africa as elsewhere , and lack of investment for research of these diseases are a major problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research , which is conducted by African scientists themselves , in building its own research capacity in Africa . a major role of science and technology can be con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve for the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
DR Ran@@ j@@ it &apos;s Director of the centr@@ all@@ ine Centre for the research of inf@@ ectious diseases in Zam@@ bia ( Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zam@@ bia ( CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
&quot; he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zam@@ bia , especially when the AIDS epide@@ mic is the first serious impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zam@@ bia for studying in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; being a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania he himself at the HIV virus , before it decided to go home to support the sam@@ ic health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. Rest@@ ore discussed the future of medical research in Zam@@ bia and about mis@@ concep@@ tions of the media via this research . &quot;
( Disclaimer : Dr. Grund@@ er speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it &apos;s R@@ W : at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results . thereby , I support the sam@@ ic national program for anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral therapy ( ART ) with laboratories . &quot;
&quot; in addition , I just start a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ ogen@@ s . &quot;
G@@ V : what are your opinion about the important current sciences topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
r@@ w : there is no basic research here . we only rely on solutions that have been developed in different ways .
&quot; this must change , otherwise we will always stay recei@@ vers , instead of being mut@@ acher . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that we get , are often used in our surroundings , and sometimes it is impossible to use them here . &quot;
G@@ V : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is to find suitable scientists for projects ?
r@@ w : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are also very well supported .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or go here , as funding and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
G@@ V : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
&quot; r@@ w : basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have continuous supply to electricity , water and internet . &quot;
laboratories are expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
G@@ V : how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; r@@ w : there are interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; G@@ V : how large is your opinion , according to the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it concentrate , and how can we support the development ? &quot;
r@@ w : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; the social sciences , computer sciences , big data , research of space , public health ( not transfer@@ able and cont@@ agi@@ ous diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ V : you can describe the advantages and cons of life as a scientist in Africa to western countries , based on your experience ? &quot;
&quot; r@@ w : often there are the limited speed , things to do , and the hard access to scientific expertise that represent here challenges . &quot;
the system that magazines apply only to payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) is also limited to the quantity of availability information and the speed of research .
from the US to India : as &quot; open source &quot; seed producers to change global food production
&quot; this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank M@@ orton has been bre@@ d since the 1980s in the US Sal@@ at .
&quot; his company offers 114 varieties , like for example Out@@ red@@ ge@@ ous , the first plant that is grown by NASA @-@ A@@ stron@@ auts in space and consumed . &quot;
&quot; for nearly 20 years , Mort@@ ality has been working only by its own imagination and the question as many sal@@ ads he can get limits . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 2000@@ s he noted that more sal@@ ads were pat@@ ented , and that he could not use them further to the bre@@ eders . &quot;
&quot; the patents g@@ athers not only for individual varieties , but also for specific properties such as resistance to diseases , a special Rot@@ or , or green@@ ey@@ ed leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , more and more such patents have been registered in more and more plants such as grain or cart@@ ot@@ ers . due to this trends , plant bre@@ eders , environ@@ ment@@ alist and experts in food safety for the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia , M@@ orton still bre@@ d Sal@@ at , he has now needs longer since his work is getting more and more constra@@ ints . &quot;
&quot; it is , when would lie in a river a rocky bro@@ cken to which I have to go . &quot;
&quot; so we have to do that now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that this patents go on sal@@ ads . &quot;
&quot; and if they hold them in court , no one can grow more of a new sal@@ at@@ ters because all features are already pat@@ ented . so he makes it as good as possible and tries to grow ones who he wants . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and tried to use no material that is protected as being intellectual property . &quot;
he also joined the movement in the US and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; ) .
A@@ stron@@ auts at the International Space Station ISS have bre@@ d red red@@ mer@@ sal@@ at the Sor@@ te Out@@ red@@ ge@@ ous in the &quot; Green@@ house &quot; of the station and eaten there . there is tested whether plants can be cultivated in space .

&quot; it is no co@@ incidence that this name sounds rather as it would be the movement from IT @-@ sector , and not out of the field of plant breeding . &quot;
&quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; &quot; Sa@@ at@@ well ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , the alternatives provided by copyright protected software . &quot;
&quot; it was brought to life to ensure that some plant species and men are not protected as intellectual property , and thus are so usable for plant bre@@ eders . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the initiative , in short O@@ ssi , U.S. bre@@ eder can also commit that others can use them with seeds . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed , and do not sell it . &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; bre@@ eders only allow others to breed for so own varieties and not immediately pron@@ o@@ unce - two aspects that are prohibited by many plant pat@@ ente . &quot;
do@@ z@@ ens bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding views
&quot; for the em@@ eri@@ ed professor at the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin Ma@@ dison and O@@ ssi @-@ Board Member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control over the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important to food safety and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; according to him a role in larger mer@@ ges like biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to use the latter or not only little by doing seed with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stres@@ ses that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement is not busy with gene@@ tically modified plants .
&quot; all kinds of plants could be pat@@ ented , whether vegetables , Kor@@ n , gene@@ tically modified or not , from ecological agriculture , or not , from ecological agriculture , or not . &quot;
dietary sou@@ l@@ eness without seed @-@ sover@@ eign is not possible .
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed initiative is committed to providing other their seed , and to pat@@ enting their actions in contrast to seed and plant nur@@ series . &quot;
photo of Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
&quot; O@@ ssi @-@ supporters argu@@ ed that the future of food supplies is endangered because the available gen@@ pool due to becoming more numerous intellectual property rights on plant material , which therefore always be limited available , un@@ break@@ able . &quot;
&quot; Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , Executive director of the O@@ ssi , has been employed in her Ph@@ D work with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . it found that about a third of all cart@@ ot@@ ten@@ ants are protected as intellectual property , which makes it not easy to use for plant bre@@ eders . &quot;
&quot; for other plants there are such estimates yet not , but experts like Lu@@ by susp@@ ect that mass@@ ac@@ ulous plants are pat@@ ented in a bigger style as Sal@@ at or car@@ rots . &quot;
a question of view of view
&quot; plants are so bre@@ d that they have targeted characteristics - of such , through which their tastes or their colour improves up to such , due to those they prosp@@ ered in certain environments , such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for bre@@ eders are increasing by ever more patents . genetic diversity is now however necessary than ever , since the changing conditions are much worse due to climate change . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail address Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ Spe@@ aker in Car@@ ly S@@ ca@@ du@@ to , that genetic diversity is generally important and also critical for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four gen@@ ces and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Ministry of Commerce . &quot;
&quot; it is contrary , however , the opinion that intellectual property are meant to promote other bre@@ eders , as &quot; patents and protection of plant vari@@ cose innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow , once the patent is exp@@ ired . &quot;
often these instructions help others to come with another method for the same result .
such protection does not inhi@@ bited innovation but supports them by providing the public more material and know @-@ how .
&quot; M@@ orton sees the other way : 20 years to wait until a patent exp@@ ose , and certainly no innovation . &quot;
&quot; and if you are waiting for long to wait to grow to plants that have been adapted to the modified environmental conditions , the struggle would have already been lost . &quot;
&quot; but the main document for M@@ orton is however , that genetic resources have always been a common good and will continue to stay : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ ary incentives are not attractive for us . &quot;
we want to facilitate farmers their work .
&quot; this is what drives us , and it will be impossible for us if we will not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; in total , M@@ orton to pat@@ enting oneself to the concept to pat@@ enting Plant : &quot; we create the characteristics not really itself . &quot;
&quot; the plants are formed by themselves and as bre@@ eders , we have no idea how the plants do that . &quot;
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for Car@@ ol Dep@@ pe , plant nur@@ series in the US @-@ State Oregon and O@@ ssi @-@ Board Member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; those who grow a sor@@ row , bre@@ d also its own values into them . &quot;
&quot; who believes in industrial agriculture with great cour@@ ty@@ ards and mon@@ oc@@ ultur@@ es , for their cultivation mass@@ aging Her@@ bi@@ zi@@ de , who grow in his varieties of this concept of farming . &quot;
my concept is exactly different . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that are on international markets , but less than Mon@@ san@@ to are patents , even without patents manage to survive - either they reject the patent on or they do not keep it for too expensive and therefore not rewar@@ ding or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant bre@@ eders Frank M@@ orton seeks in his breeding garden sal@@ ads .
photo of Karen M@@ orton .
&quot; M@@ orton is also the view that bre@@ eder by the prevention of plant pat@@ ented innovative would : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts , new to produce new , stronger than companies , the patent . &quot;
&quot; I need a constantly new material for my catalogue , as I know that my ri@@ vals will be selling my varieties in a couple of years ago , &quot; says he . &quot; with a patent is one 20 years ahead of competition , which makes it quite easy to do . &quot;
&quot; although the US seem to be leading in the &quot; open source &quot; discipline , but the concept is now spread all over the world . &quot;
&quot; in India the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which itself sees itself as professional organisation in the field of resources , an &quot; open source &quot; seed program , the center with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties to meet certain requirements . &quot;
&quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; seed and sell their own . &quot;
&quot; the German organization Agre@@ co@@ l is working on a &quot; open source &quot; license , which is ultimately a formal and legal form of the O@@ ssi @-@ obligation for bre@@ eders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( regulations for the bre@@ eders differ from country to country , present because of the O@@ ssi @-@ obligation cannot simply become one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive committee of the European Union , the European Commission , declar@@ es that conventional plants should not be pat@@ ented to be pat@@ ented against the current practice of the European patent . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; it is now on the governments of the Member States to implement the patent office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference to &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over the East Africa to learn something about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards pat@@ enting seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; Program for &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ Sa@@ at@@ gut@@ ters , that the organization is currently establishing a worldwide alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ seed systems , for the planned next year of the official start signal . &quot;
&quot; a mer@@ ger of environmental protection and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international Non@@ profit organization , US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on E@@ ro@@ sion , Technology and Concent@@ ration ) has compiled a database of seed , technology and Concent@@ ration ) , to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the future of the food - an association and made from aid agencies like the w@@ k Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report that farmers have to come to Sa@@ at@@ well to ensure that a stable supply of food can be ensured . &quot;
&quot; in the report , the importance of a diverse , local care is emphas@@ ized with seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection from Lu@@ by from O@@ ssi to be seen him soon . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has above all attention to where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly ever played a role , so Lu@@ by . &quot; we are trying to move the people even more behind their foods . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest objectives of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
still the Egyptian authorities content on the Internet .
this time it was the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ est .
&quot; on weekends the Egyptian government the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world . &quot;
&quot; August , the network published a statement on Facebook in which it cri@@ tici@@ zed the Egyptian authorities for this step and said to continue working and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information Compar@@ er despite this attack and the potential of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities , who have actually been able to re@@ conc@@ ile the freedom of speech and human rights in the Arab world , so it was never so difficult to overcome these goals , to overcome the blo@@ cking , and not to admit it . we ins@@ ist on it to continue our task . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is considered to be the first written website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities blo@@ cking up the independent news of MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , arab@@ ic @-@ speaking issue of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and that from Qatar Hospit@@ alized network of Al J@@ az@@ e@@ era because of in@@ sensi@@ cal &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;

&quot; besides AN@@ HR@@ I , there is also no access to the blog of the Colom@@ ni@@ est and human rights @-@ research , Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada no access to Egypt . &quot;
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of colum@@ ni@@ sts and articles that he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
&quot; now the blog , he was as he prayed to deal with the c@@ ens@@ ors of the Egyptian government , even the objective of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blog@@ gers , the provider with the also goat blog is heated , on the other hand is further accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in cap@@ tivity , having been arrested in December 2013 by Egyptian vulner@@ abilities , while he took over the Stud@@ enten@@ este protests and a video , such as the police of physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles mainly turn to politics and human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada on the blo@@ cking through the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; the , blogs to lock is very old , however , has a priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the blo@@ cking of the blogs may not be meaning@@ less for the world , so it is for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has managed to give me the feeling of an insu@@ lator , a su@@ pre@@ y murder , pro@@ ach by the national Security Council , the blo@@ cking blogs as well as any other website , for which I worked . &quot;
2 ) You have proven that I was not mist@@ aken . in other words : my words have influence even if only on a small audience .
I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I used it to the post of articles to get the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship . &quot;
&quot; however , after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the Mu@@ t walk the way up to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities of 24 May to 06 . August 133 websites . this provides technical tests in the networks of different Internet Service Provider ( IS@@ P ) , including Orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at . &quot;
&quot; AF@@ TE documented also the blo@@ cking of vend@@ ors , through the revers@@ al of dor@@ mit@@ en@@ sur and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ PN@@ s ) &quot;
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12th , we noticed how the blo@@ cking of web pages , the V@@ PN@@ s began . &quot;
such an practice indicates the intention of the government to continue to block content and gain access to the Egyptian user .
&quot; in addition , the situation will be wast@@ ed in addition to closed doors that the Egyptian population has no legal basis so that they can proceed before judgment against these actions . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and whom will it be next attack ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants are riding .

&quot; day for day report , newspapers in all Brazil with triple impact from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous Post@@ card moti@@ ons . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old school were shot in school , &quot; &quot; Y@@ et second day will be a police force in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Di@@ ebe ro@@ b pharmacy through military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er s@@ sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Marine and Lu@@ ftw@@ af@@ ee to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the impact of violence reached in Rio the highest state for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazi@@ lian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice had even called the United Nations to interven@@ e .
reports such as these are everyday and this is unacceptable and # 8@@ 212 ; at least the manager of a local newspaper .
&quot; for the detailed reporting of violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; on 16 August the editorial &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; in which they arrived , a new section called &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city will now be published there .
the moti@@ ves for their decision explained the newspaper so :
&quot; extra will continue to report about crimes committed in every major city on the world as murder , Rau@@ b , sexu@@ ality , etc. all that happens from the civili@@ zed standard and what only in Rio is published in the heading &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
&quot; this is the only alternative , so that we as a journalist cannot grasp our eyes in front of the cru@@ el@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; in a four@@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , stated Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper that this decision is not a reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure . &quot;
&quot; extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war bri@@ tish in one country , which at all does not realize the war . &quot;
&quot; in the same video a journalist of the newspaper explains that it will be controlled by the Institute for Intern@@ al Security in Rio de Janeiro and Janeiro areas , which will be controlled by criminal organisations . &quot;
in the editorial article the paper continues :
&quot; we are aware that a war dis@@ course is broken , even if it is dist@@ ort@@ ed , even ten@@ ds of the police , which only sho@@ ots and then ask questions to hide . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and fight against corruption in police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Maf@@ ia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; more than they get useful ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Brasil arg@@ um@@ ented the journalist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , to call the violence as &quot; war &quot; . &quot; this was their opinion a justi@@ fication of the failed security policy by the media and it could make sense to account responsibility in the police . &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as Extra as the analysis of military interest rates in Rio itself - in combination with in@@ sufficient investment in personnel , enlight@@ enment and a historical and self @-@ pleas@@ ing negl@@ ect of public service . &quot;
&quot; to remember , the federal state Rio de Janeiro is greater than just its capital . &quot;

&quot; to call Rio de Janeiro as &quot; &quot; the non @-@ violent location in Brazil &quot; , &quot; according to Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 violent cities in Brazil , according to statistics from 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the most current data . &quot;
none of these cities is located in the federal state Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; when we look at the Mor@@ dr@@ ates per federal state , Rio on Square 16 &quot; , &quot; she writes . &quot;

&quot; in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of r@@ ape deaths . for some years the U@@ PP has led to several reports on Sch@@ ik@@ anas and repres@@ sions against poor communities who should protect the newly created police unit , increasingly under circum@@ ference . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ Ã£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux from one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not set the - by the Geneva Convention established - criteria for the term &quot; civil war &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as war is also serious consequences for the people . &quot;
&quot; for this calls on the state to use the means and ways that are typical of a war . it belongs to the territory of a &quot; &quot; enemy &quot; , &quot; in which a civil war is an un@@ sharp point in the countryside and an object for &quot; coll@@ ater@@ al@@ ms &quot; and &quot; sh@@ ou@@ r@@ ed balls &quot; . &quot; &quot;

source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian Revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from gross and block@@ ages , mainly by the Assad regime towards lo@@ y@@ ale troops . &quot;
&quot; according to vic@@ tories , a joint initiative of the peace organization P@@ ax and the Forschungs@@ institu@@ t The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ ei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of si@@ ege . &quot;
&quot; particularly strongly affected is the region of East G@@ hou@@ ta , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition have come from , based on investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the mass@@ ac@@ re was practi@@ sed by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these were led by Reb@@ els controlled neighborhoods outside Damascus under si@@ ege , which resulted from residents on the following or through tun@@ nels and control points . &quot;
&quot; due to the years of block@@ age block@@ ade , traditional food and meat has become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter@@ balance , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and acade@@ m@@ ics the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ tas , how they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food source &quot; . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da and perform the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms do not belong to the conventional , in Syria , and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , it makes it an attractive food source for many residents of the besi@@ eged East G@@ hou@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the main objective of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we decided to cultiv@@ ate ourselves for the cultivation of mushrooms , because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat and because they can plant them into houses and cell@@ ars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organiz@@ ers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , that has been fighting for three years now , this project and aff@@ lic@@ ted his relief that it is now more and more &apos; of acquain@@ tance . &quot;
&quot; to gain money for the initiative , we use in consultation with the NGO Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to give 125 families knowledge to plant@@ ing mushrooms , so Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article they have achieved over 100 % of their expected target from about 12.@@ 700 â¬ , but to Monday , the 04 . September 2017 , continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is dependent on generators , which keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and the humidity at 80 % . &quot;
&quot; because of the fuel of fuel are used locally , locally used fuel from plastic surgery to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices , that they began with &quot; production from the regions of &quot; &quot; fung@@ us &quot; &quot; before they are veri@@ fied their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; then they planted a small mush@@ room in a tub . when this was yellow , they used a greater bet . and so on . &quot;
&quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; teacher @-@ house for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project , and after another 3 months they have built mushrooms everywhere in East G@@ hou@@ ta for free . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la declared that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to bring people the pilgri@@ ms for different reasons &quot; : fr@@ action of the si@@ ege . &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
&quot; spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency , by sens@@ ational ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , cardboard , etc ) to produce new food . &quot;
&quot; creating new jobs , especially for women who work home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities that are bound to their home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; we hope to spread this idea all over the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and si@@ ege is visible . &quot;
&quot; we want our experiences to help people in crisis areas , and we can help humanity . &quot;

the way from refu@@ gee from Afghanistan to successful business owners

in one night in the autumn 1994 the quest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
&quot; two years ago was a terrible civil war between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n group group@@ ings , which had defe@@ ated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . so Afghanistan has become a land of terror and desp@@ air . &quot;
&quot; at this time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , which belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Af@@ gh@@ istan for the last time with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even though his mother didn &apos;t say it then , so she knew that she would no longer see her son a long time - maybe even more . &quot;
in the dawn the boy should break up .
his unc@@ le would pick him up and bring him to the locks .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari the leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ W@@ ah@@ dat had just been mur@@ dered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara felt suddenly un@@ protected .
the Taliban known for their hat@@ red on the Haz@@ ara known Taliban were getting closer .
many Haz@@ ara took the land towards Pakistan or Iran .
several days after its escape was A@@ shar@@ k found himself in Pakistan .
he worked for a couple of years in a coal . the work was heavy and made him sick .
&quot; then he took that what was left of its low wages , and went to Iran . once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and tow@@ ed bags with a mur@@ derer , the he@@ avier than he himself , in order to earn his livel@@ ih@@ ood . &quot;
&quot; at that time , as today , life of Af@@ gh@@ an refugees had been characterized by mis@@ erable and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; remember@@ ed A@@ shar@@ k in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Af@@ gh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site , on which we also worked . &quot;
&quot; there was no services there and no heating . we stand n@@ ylon in front of the open windows , so that we don &apos;t er@@ ased at night . &quot;
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ k left his life without papers in Iran and ready for travel to Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the dangerous passage on the sea , he shi@@ fted ship@@ wre@@ ck and stran@@ g@@ ated on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities had rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ k came to Italy . &quot;
&quot; some time was A@@ shar@@ k hom@@ eless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks , and went to a church twice a day meal . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy is a second chance for distr@@ acted asylum seek@@ ers , but it is true that the conditions that are asylum seek@@ ers in the country , dis@@ astro@@ us . &quot;
&quot; the Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; suff@@ ers from a general lack of transparency . &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of the asylum seek@@ ers will be accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; special recording centers . &quot; this is the impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared staff . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian law asylum seek@@ ers can only be assigned to a recording center , if officially added a motion on Asyl@@ um - which is still to move to the registration of the Asyl@@ um . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for an accommodation , rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
so there is also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his inno@@ cence of life helped A@@ shar@@ k to get rid of these conditions soon .
&quot; after spending several years of work in construction , A@@ shar@@ k had its entire savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice . &quot;
this went so well that he had opened a second hostel after a while .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now on the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Vene@@ tian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director A@@ min W@@ ah@@ id@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the film was awarded the Venice City Award , which was awarded for the 4th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to the official estimates , approximately 20,000 Af@@ gh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a super@@ vised solution on its way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , some of Af@@ gh@@ ans business companies , including tail@@ oring , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Af@@ gh@@ an restaurants have even served in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ahm@@ adi had the idea to his Restaurant Ori@@ ent Experience , where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen mostly come from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant tells the different Af@@ gh@@ an , Ira@@ qi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their trip to Italy . &quot;
the Af@@ gh@@ an entrepreneurs Ali Kh@@ an Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a S@@ ushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghanistan .
&quot; but A@@ shar@@ af@@ s targets are far beyond the Italian gastronom@@ ic rat@@ ory and the retail and aim to go back to the land , which he had to leave as a teen@@ agers . &quot;
&quot; where a risk is also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ k with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I never forget my country and I cannot live happy if I know that my people suffer .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of the society and must get the same options as anyone else . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af and also for@@ ged plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and preser@@ v@@ atives . &quot; thus , they can sell their harvest on the market and improve their financial situation . &quot;
&quot; the development of successful entrepreneurs was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end stand stability and prosperity . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey itself . now , he also wants to help other Af@@ gh@@ ans . &quot;

&quot; the Egyptian parliament reviewed a bill &apos;s bill , which means that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration in a government authorities . &quot;
&quot; it would have to be able to use the social networks , within six months of successful legislation on the website of the authority under indication of their full name as well as their expression number . &quot;
&quot; those who rel@@ amed this step , could lead to up to six months sentence or the dischar@@ ging of a criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; the law , which was applied by sixty members , is currently under the legislative and constitutional Committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another member of the member states ought to be adopted into the t@@ oug@@ her pen@@ alties for the insu@@ lt of the President or a high officials . &quot;

&quot; should the law adopted , this can mean up to three years imprisonment for judgment . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would be a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of expression has been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a stri@@ king example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o zi@@ d ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) which was photograph@@ ed on 13 August 2013 , as he demonstrated violence against demonstr@@ ators who had led to the military coup d Moh@@ ammed Mor@@ si . &quot;

will China force the user of social media to submit their reference ?
&quot; following new rules of the information offices of the Federal Republic of China &apos;s Republic of China , users need to write or share social media in China before they share messages in social media . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the registration will also be stated that registration will be necessary with the full re@@ viewer name . &quot;
analy@@ sts dis@@ cour@@ aged that this should be reached by elimin@@ ating anonymous comments in sub @-@ agencies within social networks . it is now un@@ clear how the authorities apply these regulations .

&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or failed We@@ chat , to register with the provin@@ cial government as &quot; organiz@@ er of the Information &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this design@@ ation is part of a law from the year 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government will organise a list of online services that will organise the publication of the information responsible for the removal of content and to force them on request for the exclusion of user data . &quot;
