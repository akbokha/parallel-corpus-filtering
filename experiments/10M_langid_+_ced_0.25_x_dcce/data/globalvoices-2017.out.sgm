<seg id="1">"although I visited the USA for at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is tremendous.</seg>
<seg id="4">"as many of my generation I grew up with American films, I have read American music and operated by American music and operated his sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had a profound impact on me, that I was mainly because of an American film journalist."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, who covered with the help of Julia Roberts as an Jura student, who had covered his interest by Julia Roberts as the Jura student, who wanted his interest in mind."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free to Method Man," "I was, as if that is the absolute truth, you forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year, which I lived in Arizona, had more admiration for the US only."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said," America is the only country where I have ever lived, whose variety is so inviting, that you can always be that you are and it is easy acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I had even written a very warmed view of his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he goes with his bottling.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops with his opinion behind the mountain as it says so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks of like a former colleague, and explained publicly his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, AfroAmerican and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million voices, which he won in the Republican presidential elections, was the highest number that ever reached a candidate candidate."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans who support this bigsoons person, I asked me?"</seg>
<seg id="21">"I was able to bring Trump and his voters do not bring to people with people, which I met in Phoenix during my time."</seg>
<seg id="22">"as for example my Professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalist program, the people from all over the world take, a deep believer man, which I could talk about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Trumps world illustrates not with the by Peter Bhatia, the current publisher of the" Cincinnati Inquirer "." "</seg>
<seg id="24">"Bhatia and I met us in our common love for basketball, and we spent many hours to watch the" Phoenix Sun "while playing."</seg>
<seg id="25">"intolerance is also reflected in contrast to generosity that I lived at Sandy Bahr, who fought for her life for the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like their son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"still it fits to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace to me and my colleagues helped us to get used to the complexity of the American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise counsel helped me a lot with my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those through it incarnates my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump took his way to nominate Republican presidential data, they offered me a stop and the counterpart of his restricted vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">However it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">"on November 8, 2016 over 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps because of his contempt against non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the confrontation with the idea that people have voted for Trump because they either shared its racism and fanaticism, or because they were ready to oversee these things, and broke me almost the heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to describe the Trump dial as a cashier.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to arrange the people, said one of my friends, is exactly what we have led to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">"this is superficial and respectful, and indicates an inability to understand those who act in another way and think."</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not considered.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters have voted most of whom most white are tuned for Trump because they want to regain control over a country that she disappointed?</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might want to say that they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick who commented the cruel decision to raise a man who look with contempt on those who look differently than he."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" "Whitelash" "(m.): so much as" "resolution of the wheat against all other ethnies"; Wortacle from white in reference to the White and Whiplash, as much means as Schleudertrauma), as it did the great Van Jones called, exactly what America did so great. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people all over the world appreciate American Ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background one may have always appreciated, America means every welcome."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country elected as his president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose history, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"with the election Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says: to hell with versatility, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is again at the ruder, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"in all that I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who dropped in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">At a demonstration of Hillary Clinton Mr. Khan had a wording metabolism with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>

<seg id="52">"have Latinos a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" "answering them."</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro-Americans a place in your America?</seg>

<seg id="57">"he received an unanimous and accordingtostrong" "NEIN" "!"</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan closed with the words:" "God is thanks, Mr. Trump, is not your America." "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land, for which his son enjoyed, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now Trumps Land, said the message."</seg>

<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a great garbage dump, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city, which is very popular among tourists among the nearby premiered ruins and its world-famous kitchen."</seg>
<seg id="73">"since several years now, the La Banda de Música (Musikbande) has now been playing in the municipality: one of children and adults of existing symphony orchestra, which has found an opportunity for overcoming the poverty."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the municipality, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexicos, is known for its drug abuse and the banden violence."</seg>
<seg id="77">"however, this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth were so rare hopeless."</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, means the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:"</seg>

<seg id="80">"they always come lend and with shiny eyes and play in the chest you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, Oboe, flute, Bongos and the Conga."</seg>

<seg id="84">"the instruments mimic violins, violas, coelli, contrabasses, guards, saxophones, trombones, trombones and percussion, all of which were made out of the trash."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayian and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article of the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local environmentalist and music-instructor of the children of Cateura, to the initial time:"</seg>
<seg id="87">"first it was very difficult, because we had no place to rehearsals and we had no place at the same point where the parents worked in the trash. children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents, because many of them do not live with their children."</seg>
<seg id="88">"this changed as Favio, what he has never seen before: one of the fall of waste."</seg>
<seg id="89">"today, there is an entire orchestra which plays on instruments from restored material and is called The Recycled Orchestra."</seg>

<seg id="101">The East-African countries were here as appealing and little gences to welcome a lawyer of this kind in its coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Komoren, Mosambique and the Seychelles mobilized down quickly towards the ship. they refuse him to share one of their ports and refused to share it a fishing permit."</seg>

<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch the fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"ultimately, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia because of pillage of fish stocks."</seg>

<seg id="107">"the members of this network are distributed in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, which at that time the prime minister had driven out of its waters."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" with this we have eight countries to work together and work together. they exchange information from and stand up each other when it comes to illegal fishing, "says Tony Long, Head of the Pew Charitable Trusts project ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers the FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is regulated by definition, which is caught, is hidden, why it is extremely difficult to use it. thus, the illegal fishing is a major matter of overfishing of regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"through the abattained miscontempt of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems may have harm which have a delikates balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"however, while actions against illegal fishing was once heighted through bureaucratic hurdles and also by the Schneckentempo, with the information between individual countries, so the actions today occur in real time, with traceable on the ISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"there, each other countries can share a list with each other as a list of lists, news about suspected activities or details, which one noticed during a port inspection or experience."</seg>

<seg id="115">"in the idealcase, such investigations may show whether the students involved have a fishing license where they were on the road and may also whether they have a penal code."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are opposed to illegal fishing, the acceptance of such ships can be used in their ports. what does the ships could not sell their charge. and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it is then about significant financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is not worthwhile itself anymore."</seg>
<seg id="118">"and that is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, leading Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a mountain company which supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already mentioned platform was created to estimated 20 million USD in lost sales, who lose the eight members of the network HISH-i each year because of illegal fishermen that penetrate in East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the productive tuna-fish that attracts the region's commercial fishing from all over the world. among these also those illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">"to their practices include actions such as the sailing under false flag, counterfeit licensing securities, indication of fantasy, the fish-protected species and fishing in nature areas."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non-long organised control system", "says Long." "earlier, a ship could not be illegal fishing and a country could say 'You dared my harbour."</seg>

<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only sense crime but they also frightened.</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships that have been exploited without a license and hardly expected to calculate the consequences, now they know that they are observed."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in the FISH-i participated in the meantime by a 33% increase in fishing hub, fishing boats and buy more licenses."</seg>

<seg id="148">"there are six countries participating in 2015, for so called West Africa Task Force. also they are fighting the illegal fishing industry, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i." "With safety is the goal, even more such initiatives and structures to be created in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's youngest member states in Somalia could report his first big triumph in October: in October there was Greko 1, a ship which was on the way out under falscher's flag. and not only the ship was used without a license and were used tucked network, which are now prohibited."</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translators are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"to transfer one needs two important skills: passive language skills to understand the starting text, and active language skills to put it into the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter demands the active rule of the target - something that is in case with native linguistics. in general, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the output language - mothertongue should be."</seg>
<seg id="379">"thus, a French native language language should be translated for example from English to French - not from French to English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr-User Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as motherlanguage, which might have translation into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of the transfer, cost-reasons or the relatively small number of English native tongue, the japanese language."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies who have no foreign workers, have yet made some foreign employees, but then the Japanese staff will be made as the best, to translator translators - regardless of how good or bad his language skills really are."</seg>

<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the worshipped and rushed sentences, which can be created by machine translations, show that this technique is not yet able to replace a human translator. this applies to some languages entirely."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strange English formulations in Japan, including the puzzling formations containing often T-shirts or pockets, are used only for classy reasons - not to be read or even understood."</seg>

<seg id="786">"for me it is, as if they confuse those who have lost somebody and those that fear that they have happened so something."</seg>

<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" "Kalar" "or", "(burmesan script) as part of an initiative to tackle the widely spread problem of the Hasslanguage in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely low-breaker circles.</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that is mostly used by Ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in the effort to fight Hasslanguage in Myanmar, the company has recognised a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"Kalar's may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself is not automatically revealed to itself."</seg>

<seg id="1299">The Facebookused Aung Kaung Myat declared the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">"a post of one of my friends has been deleted today, because he was the word of Kalar."</seg>

<seg id="1310">"the good is that these dreckling nationalists to spread the Hasslanguage, a fairly good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to describe their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to all, the hate language, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experience of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and Wechat have proven that the censorship of stroke often becomes a cat - and mouse-game, using social networks simply to begin to express a new word or alternative spelling of the word term to express their views."</seg>

<seg id="1323">To sing such words will only bring more hate within the different communities.</seg>

<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs which exist in 13 Indian States, it is part of the campaign # KhelBadal that is engaged by the community of Video Volunteers and sets out for the dismantling of the Patriarchate."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"Rohini Paist has been working with the help of her video camera to the uncovering of practices, such as children's debt up to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and guides these clubs."</seg>
<seg id="1480">They reported how these clubs are created a safe place for these women and at the same time they have made bothered at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video, the Rohini showed in its discussion, were of women who do not name their husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this issue because they wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"not to speak according to the name of their spouses, a Brotherly, is a breeze, and never questioned in question."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini thinks:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testified that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"a woman who do not hold this, is considered adly, as a woman without moral."</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply rooted that we never have thought about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini wanted to never called its husband until now, at home, as it runs at home as it runs."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion of her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband will take a long time after the video was at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned up to me and said, I have asked him from now on his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in the luggage started Rohini started its first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" Patriarchate "before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"at the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women sought to get the discussion with a exercise in motion."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked every participant in the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then asked them all," If we cannot say the name of our spouse, but they can call us how they want, means they do not respect us? "</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when she brought the name of her husband over the lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about the Break of a centuries-old tradition, in which women never married the name of her husband's wives. "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy that during the whole exercise, a different decided to cut out frustration against him and his family, by doing it fluctuate."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ekstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"even in the adrenalin talk about that, with an ancient glasses, the women decided that they would actually try at home to name their spouses in the name."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they stopped their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband called a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas they put in the head: his wife could not stop his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club members decided to do it with dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law she anstarrte, she got fear and said that it was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"another woman said," "Rohini said, I do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant in was less understandable and the situation arted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports, such as women have tried to stop other practices, like for example the gages of the galvanized red point on the forehead, who shows the spellatus:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why must only women show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would bear the galvanise red point, if he also worked."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughs only and I listened to him to carry him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not completely heard before, but my, they are now in a better position to choose himself, not to wear it in some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we are doing a trip to any discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1520">Usually we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want to make sure that the women make sure who could hear," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">"during the last months she celebrated her own birthdays in their life their own birthdays with cake; they danced and sangen and spoke about things, about which they had never thought of thought before."</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have spoken about some things, for example how our identities have been knotted to our spouses, never so honestly spoken."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to say certain things according to say, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion section we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected with clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have taken only Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most is the okay, but some wanted a salu-course, a wide shirt about a pants, carry out; they have not geted."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after much dispute and discussion about the advantages of your own clothes-election, morals connected to the Saris and much more, taste Rohini her own pair of course (upper hemden) into a discussion, so that the women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they decided now to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure that they will be able to create it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"on the question, whether in the five months have already been changed since its first discussion club, Rohini confirmed that things are slowly coming to roles:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have so far taken small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but then hearing them again to say the name of her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, make it yet, but only if they are alone and no other family members are here."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two will continue to say the name of her husband; only one or two women now carry interest in Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">"the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to reach in their lives - like the fake around more freedom of movement or their own clothes, - at the end of a hard to navigate river."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is victim of the patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this gap gives all of us the confidence that will change something.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"and I know that it will not only be limited to 30 families, if any woman in the club goes home and other people who reports what we talk and what we do."</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sitting in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="2096">"for six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist that faces the conservative majority, and its ancient opinions about gender mains, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapid music."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, often dealing with topics like Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, it also calls for the core of the whole Arab world, but also in cities that are rich in Syria to Sanaa in Yemen."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted by boundaries in his thinking, and he can suffer according to their own statement with people who suffer the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries like Iraq, the Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>

<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" I think so, because I am a person, while in water the nests are stamped in two cups; it is the holy month of Ramadan; in this time it is intended for Muslims, from sunrise to sunset. "</seg>
<seg id="2105">The jordanic law also impacted that public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness for this, to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee at a sensing hot jitag has little with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the battles of the hot coffee and the swelling of the Kent cigarette in the nose is primarily of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially when one throws a view to the neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it is simply avoids to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan Water, to do not land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Federal Ministry of Jordan has said a appearance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time."</seg>

<seg id="2114">"in a public governement mashrou'Leila the jordan people as" progressive supporters of human rights "," which continue to work "for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement is likely not to be simply seized Rhetorik, but in fact a more clearly noticeable reality in Jordan, which occurs in Hdaibs work clearly."</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016 hook Hdaib traditional sex-ternormen to Leibe by having his vision of the fate of Arab women who have sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the image shows the skeleton of a apparently sled infamous woman, their arms and legs to stretch up to the corners of the canvas."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"she is surrounded by a red lake, perhaps the blood of the countless men who lost their lives by the hands of those who actually should trust them."</seg>

<seg id="2122">"Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is known for it, also not to redemped topics in his country as a tabu."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib honed that his work is political, however, however, that he is his music, the full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression, not of politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, Man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"I have entered politics," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb" is the focus on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the list of the songs, which are politically politically, can be continued."</seg>

<seg id="2136">"today Hdaib is open to the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance against homosexuals do not speak of Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentioned Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, which still remained in memory thanks to its homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks: when Abu Nuwhat should be working later on behalf of the caliper, in the eighth century could write openly about homosexuality, why can Jordan won't be?"</seg>

Jordan has been desperished for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - it looks like Hdaib - consists of slow, bedding and inner changes. it is sure that these changes come from day to day at the heart of the Venetian society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, as well, from an Arab world without intervention abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he not only dreamed to bring his work up to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of them to experience them."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region will help with music, art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, spreading unitions and on artificial way. at least, he hopes that."</seg>

<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to man we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not yet much more important, people who feel the spread of affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">"this question went to the two young Columbian activists, Leonardo Párraga from the foundation of BogotArt and Cristian Palacios of the Young-Youth Foundation (letters for Reconciliation), the young people to write guardians letters."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only recently, her land was the place of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to her part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace agreement with the guerillabeways FARC (English: revolutionary forces of Columbus) in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"international has been the understatement of the peace of peace, as important that the Colombian President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize in the Nobel Peace Prize."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"but in front of the Kolumnen, however, there is a long way until you can speak of a real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrilla struggles for many years have lived in illegal warehouses, and around the clock were exposed to their arms in themselves and now have to integrate themselves into life as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society in turn, which had become deeply accustomed to life in fear and in some cases, they have now to record them into their ranks and support them in building a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young columbians had to combine and help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And this is exactly what they did: to now have written thousands of young people letters - lovemaking to former guerillusions to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign are 6900 letters - one for each former guardians who will then be delivered personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the letters of reconciliation was born on the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Prize, which was held in February 2017 in Bogotá. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to speak shortly with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>

<seg id="2198">"so the plan came to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of FARC who now find their place in society and build a new life." the letters are prepared to make the discourse of a war story to a common history of peace, "they say."</seg>
<seg id="2199">"up to date, more than 2000 letters have been collected in the framework of the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Columbus, such as Cali, Manicales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I have never thought that someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters have been handed over on 19 March in one of the UN-bearings in the Caldono region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students at the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipal administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Stiftung BogotArt traveled in the camp to learn the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">"the members of the FARC stood up, as they had done it earlier to formulate the commands of their leaders."</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they received no commands, but letters full of subjugation of people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very turbulent moment for all involved." it's incredible how many different feelings can be run through just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that is between "," about the politicians "" Manuela Jiménez Avila later. "</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a collaborator of the governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, this unforgettable experience is so: "</seg>
<seg id="2208">After we passed the letters we led me a former fighter by the camp of the Guerilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" Cambuches "(a kind of hut, in which the guerillacute live), I saw a guerillaper who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go down, because beside him on the bed was a MGL pomegranate, a deadly weapon in the dormitory."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"I said to him nevertheless," "hello, what are they doing straight?" he answered, "I answered a letter that someone has written me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very beautiful and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life someone wrote something so beautiful, so I answered it." "I suddenly had the tears about the cheeks."</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him very firm and sat down beside the pomegranate.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was the war, it was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this struggles, and wanted to help him to write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he never expected anything else from life as war. the FARC, was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers in front of the famertod." "I would never thought that someone would be given for my fault."</seg>
<seg id="2217">"now I know that there is a society out there, which is waiting with open arms to us."</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I just learned how I have to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace prevails, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New votes</seg>
<seg id="2221">"for the opening, students and some leaders of FARC came together to a discussion summit."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as a war and the FARC already existed in the dark.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore, the leaders of the FARC the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views over the peace process:" many years, we have experienced the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can help to shape society in this country. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a goal of these sizes, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," said one of them. "</seg>

<seg id="2227">"the reality, in which the country lives, does me hurt."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it trillied me that all men - also those who killed and so much damage to us, and give us a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of the city of Cali, the following letter: "</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Columbian was made that after the drafting peace would reign.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as it is inequality, hunger and a lack of education, healthcare and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to raise the weapons to raise themselves and to protest for their rights. and that is also completely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we of the FARC are now putting on peace, to a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"therefore we call all the defender of peace, regardless of which race, religion or ideology they belonged to rise above all those who dream of a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, do our contribution and bring victim, as we know from our own experience, that nothing is easy. for those among us who are taking life as the basis of existence, will be many difficulties."</seg>

<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still hard for her.</seg>

<seg id="2290">"we can't stop you, because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">In my mother there was too much and she lay down a strick about the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbours came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the moment I had to switch to the apartment several times a day.</seg>

<seg id="2299">"for safety reasons I do not want to give their name price, but I will say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with her help I left the land, but then I did something uncredible."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>

<seg id="2313">OC Media: stand with your family still in contact?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we are not talking about the lovemaking we are not talking, this is a tabuary topic."</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional kaucasian elements are still in me.</seg>

<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For the needed I needed current information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">"I spoke with someone that has been lonely in Argun, a half months in Argun."</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during Ramadan no man was arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he closed a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Possibly they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"so that I mean, they probably download the relative, these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand proof that the so called" honour "has experienced by blood cougging."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are now still floating men in these secrets?</seg>

<seg id="2333">"say: should they be converted, they will show their body on TV and claim they would have attacked any village or military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people are not simply gone, but targeted refused to radialize themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is that only one mutation or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just bore someone who was imprisoned at a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard was grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was then nothing new of them.</seg>

<seg id="2342">"until now they were not presented as a banditen, so far there were no reports. we suspect that such actions are quite possible."</seg>

<seg id="2351">"Russia originally wanted to lead us to the" civilisation ", but in the Stoneage, we finally threw us back into the Stoneage."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Scharia law?</seg>

<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, there met."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been imagined.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a reduction: Kharda ma Kharda. that is: "spotte not about the unhappiness of another."</seg>

<seg id="2441">"that women are still under strictest observation, if it is about what they are going to do with their body."</seg>

<seg id="2628">"this post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been bred since the 1980s in the US Salat.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"his company offers 114 varieties, like for example Outredgeous, the first plant that is grown by NASA-Astronauts in space and consumed."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for nearly 20 years, Mortality has been working only by its own imagination and the question as many salads he can get limits."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000s he noted that more salads were patented, and that he could not use them further to the breeders."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents gathers not only for individual varieties, but also for specific properties such as resistance to diseases, a special Rotor, or greeneyed leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years, more and more such patents have been registered in more and more plants such as grain or cartoters. due to this trends, plant breeders, environmentalist and experts in food safety for the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia, Morton still bred Salat, he has now needs longer since his work is getting more and more constraints."</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it is, when would lie in a river a rocky brocken to which I have to go."</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do that now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition," he says. "I think that this patents go on salads."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they hold them in court, no one can grow more of a new salatters because all features are already patented. so he makes it as good as possible and tries to grow ones who he wants."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very careful and tried to use no material that is protected as being intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined the movement in the US and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("Open Source").</seg>

<seg id="2643">"it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather as it would be the movement from IT-sector, and not out of the field of plant breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2644">"the Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative for" Open-Source "" Saatwell) can be inspired by the movement for free "open source" software, the alternatives provided by copyright protected software. "</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was brought to life to ensure that some plant species and men are not protected as intellectual property, and thus are so usable for plant breeders."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"in the context of the initiative, in short Ossi, U.S. breeder can also commit that others can use them with seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed, and do not sell it." "open source" "breeders only allow others to breed for so own varieties and not immediately pronounce - two aspects that are prohibited by many plant patente."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Scaffolding views</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the emeried professor at the University of Wisconsin Madison and Ossi-Board Member Jack Kloppenburg are control over the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants, both important to food safety and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"according to him a role in larger merges like biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter or not only little by doing seed with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open-source" movement is not busy with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, Korn, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture, or not, from ecological agriculture, or not."</seg>
<seg id="2654">Dietary souleness without seed-sovereign is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed initiative is committed to providing other their seed, and to patenting their actions in contrast to seed and plant nurseries."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi-supporters argued that the future of food supplies is endangered because the available genpool due to becoming more numerous intellectual property rights on plant material, which therefore always be limited available, unbreakable."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, Executive director of the Ossi, has been employed in her PhD work with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. it found that about a third of all cartottenants are protected as intellectual property, which makes it not easy to use for plant breeders."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants there are such estimates yet not, but experts like Luby suspect that massaculous plants are patented in a bigger style as Salat or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are so bred that they have targeted characteristics - of such, through which their tastes or their colour improves up to such, due to those they prospered in certain environments, such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeders are increasing by ever more patents. genetic diversity is now however necessary than ever, since the changing conditions are much worse due to climate change."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail address Monsanto-Speaker in Carly Scaduto, that genetic diversity is generally important and also critical for Monsantos activities. with a total of four gences and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Ministry of Commerce."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"it is contrary, however, the opinion that intellectual property are meant to promote other breeders, as" patents and protection of plant varicose innovation. "" a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow, once the patent is expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method for the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection does not inhibited innovation but supports them by providing the public more material and know-how.</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees the other way: 20 years to wait until a patent expose, and certainly no innovation."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you are waiting for long to wait to grow to plants that have been adapted to the modified environmental conditions, the struggle would have already been lost."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"but the main document for Morton is however, that genetic resources have always been a common good and will continue to stay:" independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monary incentives are not attractive for us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to facilitate farmers their work.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us, and it will be impossible for us if we will not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"in total, Morton to patenting oneself to the concept to patenting Plant:" we create the characteristics not really itself. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">"the plants are formed by themselves and as breeders, we have no idea how the plants do that."</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant nurseries in the US-State Oregon and Ossi-Board Member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" those who grow a sorrow, bred also its own values into them. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"who believes in industrial agriculture with great courtyards and monocultures, for their cultivation massaging Herbizide, who grow in his varieties of this concept of farming."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is exactly different. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such that are on international markets, but less than Monsanto are patents, even without patents manage to survive - either they reject the patent on or they do not keep it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeders Frank Morton seeks in his breeding garden salads.</seg>

<seg id="2681">"Morton is also the view that breeder by the prevention of plant patented innovative would:" it looks like I am with my efforts, new to produce new, stronger than companies, the patent. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I need a constantly new material for my catalogue, as I know that my rivals will be selling my varieties in a couple of years ago," says he. "with a patent is one 20 years ahead of competition, which makes it quite easy to do."</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the US seem to be leading in the" open source "discipline, but the concept is now spread all over the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), which itself sees itself as professional organisation in the field of resources, an" open source "seed program, the center with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties to meet certain requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2685">"it also supports them to come to" "Open Source" "seed and sell their own."</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German organization Agrecol is working on a" open source "license, which is ultimately a formal and legal form of the Ossi-obligation for breeders in the European Union."</seg>
