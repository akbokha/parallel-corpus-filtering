this is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ it@@ zer Prize .
&quot; long before the someone had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , he wrote cr@@ en a book in which he was spectacular that the N@@ SA had illeg@@ ally released by Americans . &quot;
but there is another chapter which should leave an ab@@ iding impression .
&quot; in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence cooperation , which was literally crowded for nuclear bom@@ b for an atomic bom@@ b . &quot;
if the crazy sounds you read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapters do not coinci@@ de ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has been determined against cr@@ acks and called on him to call its own sources . &quot;
&quot; in this train , he became a symbol for the pattern of the government , wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers to condem@@ n and journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to First Constitu@@ tional , the media has the right to release secret information . &quot;
&quot; however , it is impossible to apply this right if media cannot get these information and if they cannot protect their identity of the sea . &quot;
&quot; so as the government at Ris@@ en anch@@ oring , he did something that many bra@@ ve repor@@ ters already did before him : he ref@@ used and said that he would rather go to prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , cr@@ ates lived together with risk to go to prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , only days before the process , adapted something extraordinary . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although they had years of years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped on risk . &quot;
the reason : in the period of electronic monitoring the repor@@ ters can become less and less hidden .
&quot; rather than to ex@@ tern and cr@@ ying to the statements , that could also carry out its digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and thus the medi@@ ator , without his consent , his phone numbers are secre@@ tly concerned , &quot;
&quot; just as its e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , its credit card , and even irrit@@ ating with the list of its flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condem@@ n Jeff@@ rey Ster@@ ling , a CIA W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lowers and Ris@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is just one of many cases . &quot;
President Obama promised to protect wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers . but instead the judi@@ ciary has more convic@@ ted more than all US governments in front of him .
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government is going on too much of her work as a secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , nearly every article on national security was the result of being a wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; thus we put the press work on the game , which shall be protected by the first constitutional order , because the government has more and more possibilities to hide all . &quot;
&quot; however , just as technology of the government allowed to handle the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; while they can take it from the moment in which they get in contact , rather than in the after@@ ward , in the witness . &quot;
&quot; today &apos;s communication software , which it has not yet existed as cr@@ ack his book had written , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source system for wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers , which was originally developed by the internet of Aaron , which has been developed by us , and is now being developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation where I have been developed further . &quot;
&quot; instead of send an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send information , just as with any usual contact form . &quot;
&quot; these are then encryp@@ ted and stored on a server , which only has access to the respective news agency . &quot;
&quot; so the government can no longer be ad@@ vers@@ ed , and many of the information that would call it , would not be available from the outs@@ et . &quot;
&quot; however , Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are always new es@@ pi@@ on@@ et technologies that all of us end@@ anger us . &quot;
&quot; it is to make sure that not only technology , such as Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to ins@@ ure mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers , &quot;
&quot; who want to report about abuse in the supply of soldiers and report by crowded hospitals . or the next environmental colleague , the alarm goes to the se@@ ated waters of F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street @-@ Insider that war@@ ns us before the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crimes but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thanks .
&quot; &#91; on 3 April 2016 , the largest dat@@ e@@ eck of history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; &quot; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ ates Robert Pal@@ mer from Global W@@ ren@@ ditions to a statement . &#93; this week we were conducted by news about a L@@ eck of 11 million documents in Panama - Fon@@ sec@@ a Mos@@ elle Fon@@ sec@@ a . &quot;
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers to companies such as Mos@@ pack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say , &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . &quot;
&quot; we actually see the em@@ ails , the exchange of news , as the whole system works , as it works . &quot;
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
islands Prime Minister has res@@ ign@@ ed .
&quot; also , there are reports that a ally of the bru@@ tal Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Assad has st@@ ems in tax hav@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; it is argu@@ ed that a donation of 2 billion US dollars to Russia President Vladimir Putin guides , about a narrow friend of children &apos;s ages , a famous cel@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people and others that are nervous about the next publication , and the next un@@ vei@@ ling documents . &quot;
well that sounds like the P@@ lot of an agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ RO@@ MAN@@ S .
&quot; it seems to be w@@ ept away from you , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we start what ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and mighty in the situation are to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens and not all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , streets . &quot;
and this concerns all of us .
&quot; for my organization , Global W@@ ren@@ al , these revel@@ ations are phenomen@@ al . &quot;
&quot; all over the world discuss media and leading politicians , such as secret tax hav@@ ens are used by some of them to hide and wear them -- something that we have been discussing and reve@@ aling for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people appears this whole world very conf@@ using , and it is hard to understand how these tax hav@@ ens work . &quot;
I always imagine like a Mat@@ r@@ yo@@ sch@@ ema .
&quot; so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind this prayer . &quot;
&quot; it may be very difficult for criminal law and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what thing is . &quot;
I think it also interesting that in the USA there are less reports of this matter .
&quot; pres@@ um@@ ably , because there have been no prominent Americans in these revel@@ ations , this sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; well , it is not so that there are no wealth@@ y Americans to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; but through the principle , after these tax hav@@ ens work , Mos@@ bag Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a data from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples to have connections to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that in some US states need less information to provide less information to create a company than to get a libr@@ arian form . &quot;
this kind of in@@ transparent in the US has allowed employees of shoul@@ ders allowed to desc@@ end school@@ children .
it has allowed sc@@ ams to rip especially an@@ xi@@ ous investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects us all .
here at Global W@@ aders we wanted to find out how all this in practice looks .
how does this actually work ?
&quot; so , we sent a covered agent into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan . &quot;
&quot; our medi@@ ator gave himself as African minister , which wanted to bring much money into the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
&quot; we really shock@@ ed it really , that all through on a law@@ yer of our intermedi@@ ary proposals made how he could transfer his money . &quot;
&quot; these were all pre@@ dominant . none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course anyone was given to the money . but it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important to consider this not as individuals .
&quot; it is not about a single law@@ yer , which has under@@ mines proposals . &quot;
it is not about a single leaders that trans@@ forms into a sc@@ andal .
&quot; it is about how the system works , through the corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and to cope with this , we must change the rules . &quot;
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior .
&quot; this may sound all very tr@@ endy , as if we could do nothing about it ; as if nothing could ever have changed ; as if it is always the rich and mighty . &quot;
&quot; but as a @-@ born Optim@@ ist , I see that some things have begun to change . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , we have witn@@ essed more transparency in the past few years , regarding what the owners of companies are concerned . &quot;
the topic took political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 Summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
&quot; since then , the EU is captured in central regi@@ sters at national level who really is behind companies in Europe and who is controlled . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the USA is behind .
&quot; representatives of both parties have brought a law@@ yer in both parliament@@ arians , but this does not make progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how this Panama disclosure , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and global . &quot;
for us at Global W@@ ong this is a moment for change .
&quot; we need ordinary people who are angry when they see , how other people can hide their real identity behind hunting firms . &quot;
&quot; we need ex@@ ecutives in the economy , which stand up and say , &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for the business . &quot;
&quot; we need leading politicians who realise the problem and campa@@ ig@@ ning to end this way , by laws this kind of in@@ transparent . &quot;
&quot; together we can finish the In@@ transparent , which now enables this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; this is the story , as I had almost kid@@ n@@ apped almost once and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das . &quot;
&quot; a day after I completed my design school , I made a back@@ drop . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da still stand and look my stuff .
he bought one of my works .
he was alone in the city and made straight a road trip all the country . afterwards he would go to peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him on a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; as we paid the invoice , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where do you blame ? &quot;
&quot; he made the whole thing worse , &quot; I know not yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , Man ! &quot;
what can I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sofa bed ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really is planning . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ et ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
then I listen@@ ed to say : &quot; I have a bub@@ bling . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; said a voice in my head : &quot; &quot; uh , as please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I was in bed , I was rigi@@ d to the blan@@ ket and thought : &quot; &quot; Oh Man ! what I got in rock@@ in ? &quot;
a wild@@ der sleeps in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I went out of the bed , to the door to door , and my sleeping door . &quot;
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
&quot; the artwork that he had bought by me , depends today in his class@@ room . he is now teacher . &quot;
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my point of view .
&quot; maybe the people who were sold to me in childhood as a stran@@ gers , actually friends who just waiting to be discovered . &quot;
&quot; people on my air@@ mat , was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s take a time , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost pl@@ ague , my room@@ mates are moving and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time . all hotels were fully booked .
&quot; I believe , creativity can create it to transform fear into fun . &quot;
&quot; I wrote my best friend and new room@@ mates Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I survi@@ ved , how we could make something for a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , including a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
ha !
we created a website and founded as &quot; air @-@ rat@@ ze and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ bn@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests allowed to sleep with us for 20 dollars on the air @-@ bar on wood@@ winds .
they found it great and we too .
&quot; I am sure , our cheese @-@ ham @-@ O@@ mel@@ etes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests . &quot;
&quot; we travel@@ ed with them through the whole city . when we have far@@ ewell our last guest and the door to the castle fell , rigi@@ d Brian and I felt . &quot;
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay for our rent ?
things came into roles .
&quot; my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out whether to make it a business concept .
&quot; we presented to the Invest@@ ors : &quot; we would like to create a website , on the people of public pictures from their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms , their rooms , whose doors are closed if you visit . &quot;
&quot; over the Internet , they can invite you to invite you to stay with them . &quot;
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we wa@@ ited that the miss@@ ile infl@@ amm@@ ation .
but they do not act .
&quot; nobody else , who is still at Tro@@ st , would invest in a store , stran@@ gers to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we have learned as children all that stran@@ gers are dangerous .
if you have a problem showing you on the things you can get good . we were able to design@@ ate .
&quot; at the Kunst@@ akade@@ mie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience . &quot;
&quot; we had learned how to create objects design , but now we wanted to create more immense trust between people who had never met before . &quot;
can design achieve something ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
&quot; I would like to give you a he@@ ater , what degree trust we strive . &quot;
it is a 30 @-@ seconds experiment . it will force you from your comfort .
thum@@ bs up if you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
&quot; now , I would like to share your mobile phones . &quot;
type your ent@@ angl@@ ed phone to your left seat .
&quot; this quietly excursion of panic , you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door the door . &quot;
&quot; because the only one , which is more personal than your mobile phone , your home is . &quot;
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to hold a stran@@ ger in the hands of a stran@@ ger ?
most feel the responsibility .
&quot; so , most guests feel when they can stay elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; only for this reason , our company can exist . &quot;
just time so who has actually Al Gor@@ es Mobile ?
could you declare to Twitter on Twitter that he acc@@ used for the office of the President ?
you can return the mobile phones now .
you now have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we have changed a little detail about this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighb@@ or had to be imag@@ ined once with his name ; if he told , where he comes , how his dog or his children are called ? &quot;
&quot; imagine you would have 150 Be@@ ur@@ ess@@ ments that all say , &quot; he can really stick very well @-@ err@@ ed hand@@ ys ! &quot;
how would you feel when you would have to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ made feedback system strength@@ ens the confidence decisive .
at the beginning we have done some things wrong .
it was difficult for the people to be ad@@ verse negative positions .
&quot; ultimately , we decided to wait until both host and guest had given their Be@@ ur@@ als before we set them online . &quot;
last week we have discovered something new .
&quot; we have carried out a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how they are similar to old age and residence . &quot;
little surprising we trust the people most familiar to us most .
&quot; the more differences we find , the less trust we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social pre @-@ perceived .
exciting will make when you add the reputation of a person -- in our case by Be@@ ur@@ ism .
&quot; if you have less than three ass@@ ess@@ ments , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but , one has more than ten , changes everything . &quot;
a good reputation of simil@@ arities .
the right design can thus help us overcome some of our deeply root@@ ed precau@@ tions .
&quot; furthermore , we er@@ ected that confidence is dependent on how much you can get from itself . &quot;
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; when you tell too little as for example , &quot; Hi ! &quot; , one gets more of an answer . &quot;
&quot; one tells us a lot , as for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- -- the request is also not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; Tol@@ le artwork in your apartment ! I make a holiday with my family holiday . &quot;
how can we create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text box to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips to which subjects you should write something .
&quot; our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces towards foreig@@ ners . &quot;
&quot; what we had not counted , the great multitude of people who were more than willing to put these pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
here you can see how many people will take our offer .
you can see three things .
firstly : incredibly good luck .
&quot; second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team . &quot;
&quot; thir@@ dly , a need that was not covered before . &quot;
for us the business is very good .
&quot; of course , there are also times when it is not everything smooth . &quot;
&quot; there were guests , the un@@ allowed parties celebrated or apartments w@@ ander . &quot;
hosts have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
&quot; I stood at the front front , when trust was broken . &quot;
there is nothing un@@ lim@@ mer@@ es than this calls . I already hur@@ ts if I think of it .
&quot; the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the an@@ ru@@ fer , it was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , there had only one fr@@ action on behalf of 123 million in the average . &quot;
for people trust each other to justice .
when trust works can be a miracle .
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host was driving him to hospital .
he even don@@ ate blood for the necessary operation !
here is his jud@@ gement :
perfect house for travellers to escape the activities due to heart inf@@ ectious diseases .
the area is beautiful and equipped with enough hospitals .
&quot; J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real protective angels who save lives of life , even though they don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; you drive a car into the hospital when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ yp@@ ass . &quot;
because they don &apos;t want to feel lon@@ ely put them books .
they can even stay longer without having to calculate the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so of course does not run every stay .
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with Share Economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled upon this term , I asked me : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions together ?
it is about an economic trade .
&quot; but it is now simply called &quot; &quot; hir@@ ing industry &quot; , &quot; the thing is not just right@@ eous . &quot;
&quot; share Economy describes a trade , the human relationships promises . &quot;
people place a part of itself open and that changes everything .
&quot; if you do nowadays , this is easy to compare with Fast Food . it is efficient and reliable , but it is less authentic . &quot;
&quot; what would however , if travelling a rich buffet from local impressions would be ? &quot;
&quot; what would be , if at any place , you would be visited , a group there would wait to fill a group of filling and one with a bar pent@@ ine quarter of which one has never heard . &quot;
or if cooking could learn from a five @-@ star cook ?
&quot; nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we would like to shape apartments from the ground on together ?
how would that look like ?
what would be if cities would take the thoughts of the common share ?
&quot; I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships , instead of lon@@ eliness and atten@@ uation . &quot;
&quot; in the Southern Cor@@ e@@ as capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking that belong@@ ed to the government , &quot;
&quot; now investors were offered . students , who were looking for a lead , &quot;
&quot; were con@@ veys to people whose children were passed . it became inc@@ ub@@ ator programs , &quot;
&quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . through our platform alone , 50 000 people will be hosted in 191 countries at a stran@@ ger or self . &quot;
so the idea seems not to be as crazy as it was brought to us .
we have not inv@@ ented the wheel .
hospitality was there before .
there were similar websites in front of us .
so why has exactly our works ?
&quot; apart from luck and Tim@@ ing , we realize that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome profound pre@@ judi@@ ces .
&quot; I find that intri@@ gu@@ ing , &quot;
quite overwhelming .
I have to think about what a red Maz@@ da pass over to me .
&quot; of course , we know that design cannot solve any problem . &quot;
&quot; but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use design soon . &quot;
thanks .
what do you think if you see me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or supp@@ res@@ sed , a brain @-@ under@@ ing under@@ wear , a terrorist attack ? &quot;
or simply a delay in vulner@@ abilities at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions .
&quot; thus , the media people represent , which look like me . &quot;
a study carried out that 80 % of reporting about Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : the Americans mean that most would not know Muslims .
probably people do not speak to their U@@ ber drivers .
&quot; for all those who have never met a Muslim , it is great to know you . &quot;
I say to you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra . &quot;
&quot; I am intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
&quot; furniture @-@ fitness @-@ gym , &quot;
&quot; and I am a practic@@ ing , spiritual Muslims . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga S@@ ings , because , baby , I was not so born . &quot;
I decided to do this .
&quot; when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to ou@@ ting me . &quot;
&quot; no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual man , like some of my friends , but as Muslims min . I chose Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head . &quot;
my femin@@ ist friend@@ ships were kid@@ n@@ apped : &quot; why are you oppressed ? &quot;
&quot; the funny was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , and opposite to the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt to a perfect and un@@ touch@@ able beauty . &quot;
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have been with the Quran .
&quot; I read it , thought to , asked in question , des@@ perate and credi@@ ble ultimately . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was trust and long de@@ vot@@ ion that deep@@ en with each reading of the cor@@ rid@@ or .
the beauty of the rhyth@@ mi@@ k sometimes brings me to wines .
I imagine myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; had you ever feeling that somebody you percei@@ ves , you fully understand and yet somehow loves ? &quot;
this is how it feels .
&quot; later I married and began , like all good Egyp@@ tians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; later I had later , after my wedding , a child , and lived in the &quot; &quot; Egyptian dream dream . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came the terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had at the end my breakfast , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; Bre@@ aking News &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , planes fle@@ w in building , people pointed out of the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned into emp@@ t@@ ment quickly .
why should you do something ?
&quot; I altern@@ ate the television kan@@ al and heard : &quot; ... mus@@ lim@@ ische terrorists &quot; ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; like ... &quot; ... &quot; ... Zer@@ had ... &quot; , &quot; ... Zer@@ bom@@ bs Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it has not only been attacked my country , but in the N@@ u , the acts of others turned into a sus@@ pic@@ ion in a sus@@ pic@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and begin with the European integration process . &quot;
&quot; I remember how I went -- as we were fri@@ ght@@ ening -- so deep it went into my seat , and I was afraid to be recognized as Muslims . &quot;
&quot; we went to our apartment in our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then heard , saw and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organisations that said , &quot; &quot; watch@@ ful , &quot; &quot; Sei@@ d carefully , &quot; &quot; lead in well illumin@@ ated areas , &quot; &quot; Vers@@ amm@@ m@@ elt you not . &quot;
I stayed the whole week .
then it was Friday during that week -- the day when Muslims are gathering to prayer .
&quot; and again the war@@ nings : &quot; does not go on this first Friday , the mosque might be a goal . &quot;
I saw the vast coverage of reporting .
&quot; the feelings were un@@ mist@@ aken , and I heard also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who kept for Muslims , to the open hand , and struck . &quot;
there were really brand@@ y on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something felt not really right .
&quot; because people who had attacked this country , our country attacked . &quot;
I took the anger of the people on terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to declare yourself well .
&quot; I have nothing to ask questions , I love questions . &quot;
&quot; these are the acc@@ us@@ ations , which are hard . &quot;
&quot; nowadays , we can actually say people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot;
when will we loose them ? &quot;
some people want to join Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as a tum@@ or in the body of the USA .
it &apos;s just the question : are we mal@@ icious or good @-@ good ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tum@@ or remo@@ ves as a whole and a ben@@ ign tum@@ or just under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims are , like all the other Americans , no tum@@ or in the body of the USA , but a vital organ . &quot;
thanks !
Muslims are inv@@ entor and teachers , Er@@ sth@@ and Olympi@@ ans . &quot;
will the closing of mus@@ een America make safer use ?
&quot; perhaps a few parking will be released , but will not stop the terror . &quot;
&quot; the regular visit of a mosque leads to see people &apos;s other belief , and to show greater civil participation . &quot;
&quot; and as a leader of the police in the Washington , DC recently told , people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radi@@ ated in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; when the radic@@ alization process has noticed that it starts online . as a First person , the person believes that the person believes that the person believes the true Muslims , and everyone who desp@@ ises their behavior and ideology , is a tra@@ itor or by faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we need to stop people to go to the mosque . &quot;
some are still asser@@ ted that Islam was a non@@ violent religion .
finally he founded a group like the IS their brut@@ ality with the Quran .
&quot; the Muslim min , as a mother , as a man , I believe we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
&quot; but we would add ourselves to their imagination , if you acknowledge them as representatives of 1,6 billion believers . &quot;
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam such as K@@ u @-@ K@@ lux @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology reasons on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; but if one thro@@ ws a look at it , it does not drive what they do in their &quot; Holy Bible . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that it can read these things in Scrip@@ ture .
an outstanding I@@ mam told me recently an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she would have spoken to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she was in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said , the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ ergy with whom she had spoken , brought her to silence , and told her that their wrath , their sense of inj@@ ustice in the world , it would only bring them into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that had given her anger sense , it was a main object for the instrument@@ alisation by extrem@@ ists that you have a solution . &quot;
this I@@ mam placed the link to God and her church again .
&quot; rather than to blame for their anger , he showed their constructive paths for a real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what they learned in the mosque , she kept them to join the IS . &quot;
this was an insight into how the Islam@@ op@@ hobia and my family concerns .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect anyone ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy ?
a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear that at least three things happen .
we rather accept an author@@ it@@ arian government system to con@@ form and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
&quot; a study shows : if you have reviews messages , in which negative about Muslims was reported , they have more military attacks on Muslim countries and the circum@@ cis@@ ion of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an acade@@ my problem .
&quot; when you look at when the mood against Muslims came to the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the advance of Iraq war and during two periods .
&quot; so Islam@@ op@@ hobia is not simply the natural reaction to Mos@@ lem terror , as I expected it . &quot;
it can actually be a tool to manip@@ ulation the public to make the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well @-@ informed citizens .
the handling of Muslims is a early em@@ blem .
&quot; maybe we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear sh@@ uff@@ led us all . &quot;
&quot; in the assignment of coll@@ ecti@@ vi@@ dly , it is not just about to explain itself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Ch@@ apel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a sports@@ men .
&quot; he was on the dental faculty , talented , much promise ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would say to me that he was the sweet , great @-@ heart@@ ed man who knew them . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; when is coming from my brothers , such a sealed young man ? &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne at her brother and his wife , her neighb@@ our , Cra@@ ig Stephen H@@ icks , she mur@@ dered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an that was in her apartment , as with a execution , after having expressed statements against Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot;
he took eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism cannot be im@@ moral but also fat@@ al .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
are we going to the mosque or stayed safe at home ?
&quot; we poss@@ essed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was that America we want to leave our children : one that would control us through fear , or one where we can exercise our religion free of charge . &quot;
we decided to get the mosque .
&quot; with our son in the nursery , we headed up with high pressure at the mosque . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , moved my shoes , went into the prayers , and what I saw , let me hold myself . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the I@@ mam made an announcement , and was welcomed to our guests , because half of the gathered were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hist@@ s , A@@ thei@@ sten , credi@@ tors and non @-@ believers who were not to attack , but to join us . &quot;
at this moment I am coll@@ ap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and sympathy panic and pre@@ judice .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be sure to go for sure ?
or will you join those who are my : we are better than those .
many thanks .
thanks beautiful !
&quot; Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have made a ner@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; but I wonder what do you say that you might think that you &apos;re taking a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thought of mind with deep @-@ scale , so an exception and not rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say you do not dec@@ ei@@ ve yourself . I am completely normal .
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
&quot; I am as usual , as it is allowed . &quot;
&quot; when you look to Muslims around the world , and I did that with the biggest study carried out on Muslims all over the world , people want normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want wealth for the family , they want to work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
&quot; so , I am in no sense an exception . &quot;
&quot; if people appear as an exception to rule , then the rule is usually broken , and they are not the exception to rule . &quot;
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; what started as a platform for Bast@@ ors , stands shortly before , to become a milli@@ ar@@ den@@ business . &quot;
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . possible , this will be made in research institutions worldwide . &quot;
&quot; before air condition@@ er , in our social awareness , has built a autonom@@ ous fleet of aircraft in France live in France with a six meter high tower of 1 500 Zi@@ eg@@ els . a few years ago , they began to fly with soap . &quot;
by inter@@ rup@@ ting air@@ planes high speed and acceler@@ ation at the nar@@ ro@@ west room .
you can also build self @-@ confident structures .
&quot; they have learned to wear loads , to deal with turbul@@ ence and to react in general to nature laws . &quot;
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to cross the limits of the Pos@@ sible in the autonom@@ ous flight .
&quot; to make a system aut@@ on@@ om works , it must know collective , where the mobile objects must be found . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at ET@@ H Zürich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynam@@ ical Tas@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demo@@ s , we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity studios , a publisher of our laboratories . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each panel has internal sensors to determine the position in space , calculations on board , which should do the machine . &quot;
&quot; external commands is available on the highest level . for example &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and end &quot; . &quot; &quot;
this is a so@@ gen@@ dered rear @-@ starter .
&quot; a plane , that tries to beat two flies with a fl@@ ap . &quot;
&quot; like other star@@ r@@ ons , it is efficient in the pre @-@ heating flight efficiently , much more efficient than heli@@ copter in all their variations . &quot;
&quot; contrary to most star@@ ters , it can flo@@ at , and thus it has advantages at home and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always an up@@ side . &quot;
a restriction of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they are sensitive to turbul@@ ences like wind b@@ ows .
we develop new controls and algorith@@ ms to improve this .
&quot; the idea behind it is that the aircraft , no matter in which position the optimum position can be re@@ achieved and improved the performance by nau@@ ght@@ y . &quot;
okay .
during our research we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions that penet@@ rate at the heart of the matter .
such a question would be an example : what is the smaller number of movable parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
heli@@ copter are known about as machines with a thousand movable parts that conven@@ es to hurt you .
&quot; decades ago , pil@@ ots could fly @-@ controlled flight devices that had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a rear of rear . &quot;
&quot; long , we discovered that F@@ lies with only one works . &quot;
&quot; this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechanical @-@ easi@@ est remote @-@ condition@@ er . it was recently inv@@ ented . &quot;
&quot; it has only one movable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no cl@@ apping , hing@@ es and cross @-@ body , no further actu@@ ators or cont@@ rol@@ ment @-@ surfaces , only a prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechanical simp@@ y , happens in the interior living very much , so that it can fly stable and can move in space . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorith@@ m of the rear @-@ rigi@@ d . to bring it to the rocks , I have to throw it right correctly . &quot;
&quot; the probability to throw it right , if everyone is seeing , is low , that &apos;s why I indicate you a video that was fil@@ med yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; when the mon@@ osp@@ inner is a exercise in gen@@ dar@@ ty , this machine is here , the Omni@@ pot@@ ter with his eight prop@@ ell@@ ern , a exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this transition ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
&quot; thereby , he receives the most significant capacity , &quot;
&quot; move in space in all directions , no matter in which direction it is fil@@ med or even as he rot@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight Prop@@ ell@@ ern . &quot;
&quot; some is adjustable in models , the rest is learned directly at the flies . &quot;
see what we see .
&quot; if flight machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine here consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft .
this turns on c@@ lock@@ wise
and the other against c@@ lock@@ wise .
&quot; when one build them together , they beh@@ ave like a high @-@ performance @-@ Quad@@ ro@@ copter . &quot;
&quot; however , goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a cor@@ d@@ less -- can fly the machine if also restricted . &quot;
we will now demonstrate that by half an air@@ plane .
the last demonstration studied synthe@@ tic conversion .
&quot; the number of autonom@@ ous , co @-@ ordin@@ ated units allows a range of a@@ esthetic expression . &quot;
we participated in common micro @-@ Quad@@ copter -- every single weighs less than a washer bread -- and stat@@ utes it with loc@@ alization technology and algorith@@ ms .
&quot; each unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no border . &quot;
hopefully motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine da dr@@ ing wants to become a flying lamp on Broadway .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to predic@@ t the influence of this technology . &quot;
for types like us lies the wages in the development and the creative act .
&quot; it serves as memory , how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures allowing them to form so spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such a massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
many thanks .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , in a very far distant galaxy , two black holes are getting faster , you walked as the mass thre@@ er s@@ uns in a t@@ enth energy in pure energy . &quot;
this short moment bright@@ en it bright@@ er than all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of the whole we known universe .
it was a very big bang .
but their energy put them not in the form of light free --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy has been dis@@ closed into the space @-@ time Ge@@ zer itself and the universe explo@@ ded in Gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we arrange the events at first time .
1.3 billion years ago has just been multi @-@ zel@@ lig@@ es life on the earth .
&quot; since then , the Earth has created a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , sc@@ aur@@ ier , people , and -- God stand up with -- even the Internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group of particularly bra@@ ve -- R@@ ai Weiss from M@@ IT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ Tech -- to look for a huge Laser@@ det@@ ector to search for Gra@@ vit@@ ational whales , which arise about col@@ li@@ di@@ ating black holes . &quot;
most they stopped them crazy .
&quot; but enough people knew it as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation contributed their idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely much hard work they built the det@@ ector LI@@ GO : the laser Inter@@ fer@@ om@@ eter@@ - Gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the following time , the precision of Light could be substantially increased , what the recognition of high improved . &quot;
therefore it is called Advanced LI@@ GO .
&quot; in early September 2015 , LI@@ GO was launched for a last test run by some smaller , stub@@ born problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , just a few days after the start @-@ up of the det@@ ector , the Gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two coloni@@ zing black holes through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott H@@ ugh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the far@@ ewell of my to@@ ken cran@@ ks father .
&quot; basically , it was the fruits of my life . &quot;
&quot; all that which I had worked for I , is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott H@@ ugh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ ci@@ sts at M@@ IT . he has been studied Gra@@ vit@@ ational we@@ ars from black holes and their through observ@@ at@@ ories like LI@@ GO measur@@ able signals . what are Gra@@ vit@@ ational mark@@ ers ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a cra@@ dle in the feet of space and time .
&quot; when tempor@@ arily , the wave will pull the space and its full content into one direction and into the other . &quot;
&quot; for enlight@@ enment , instruc@@ tors in courses lead to religious theory often have a really alber@@ tive dance . &quot;
&quot; stretching and du@@ sty , stretching and du@@ sty . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that Gra@@ vit@@ ational w@@ ellen extremely weak , even ridi@@ cul@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September , for example , each of us was stretched out of the waves of the waves and the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average person was 10 high . &quot;
&quot; this means 20 n@@ ul@@ len according to the com@@ ma , followed by a first time , one declared the LI@@ GO staff for crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five kilometres long laser det@@ ector , and that is already absur@@ d , this length would have to be measured to less than a thousand st@@ el of the radius of an atomic fact . this is gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k . &quot;
at the end of his classical text through gra@@ v@@ itation
&quot; described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder LI@@ GO@@ s , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ ci@@ sts are enlight@@ ened , and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
&quot; back to LI@@ GO . Scott claims , LI@@ GO is more a ear than one eye . &quot;
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wav@@ el@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : faci@@ als , the size of your mobile phones . &quot;
this is quite handy . for so you can custom@@ ize an image or a map of things by seeing the light of several points coming around you .
for killing is the different .
audi@@ ble tones have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; therefore it is very difficult , actually impossible to make a picture of things which are particularly important to you : &quot;
the face of your child approximately .
&quot; instead , we are heading according to specific properties such as tape and height , rhythm and volume , to close the history behind it . &quot;
&quot; now , she speaks just Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob supp@@ ress it . &quot;
&quot; Dum@@ mer Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them .
&quot; but by considering changes in the amp@@ lit@@ ude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least lie for LI@@ GO the master@@ ed frequencies in the audi@@ ble area .
&quot; when we shift wav@@ patterns in Sch@@ all , we can speak the universe literally . &quot;
&quot; the gra@@ v@@ itation to listen , can tell us about a lot about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been very busy for a long time . &quot;
&quot; sh : two black , non @-@ rot@@ ating holes , circul@@ ations simple : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
turn the two body very fast you hear the same pattern with an additional sound change . that sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u !
&quot; it is a kind of movement of movement , marked in the wav@@ e@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget -- heard LI@@ GO Fol@@ der : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ al Device &#93; Jem@@ and , who knows how to listen to it , recognis@@ es this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which is about as fast as the sticks of your mix@@ er . &quot;
AA : superior to us what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dense body in space , one with a mass of 29 s@@ uns , the other with a mass of 36 s@@ uns , revol@@ ve hundreds of times per second before they coloni@@ ze . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
&quot; and we know about it , because we have heard it . &quot;
therein lies the permanent importance of LI@@ GO .
LI@@ GO has a completely new way to study the universe as they never had previously been possible .
in this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
&quot; much in space , we can see -- virtually or basically -- not see . &quot;
&quot; a Super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ting stars in super @-@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de . &quot;
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about the universe .
&quot; but the exciting physical processes occur but at the core , which is hidden behind thousand kilometers of iron , carbon and si@@ lic@@ on . &quot;
we will never see through this op@@ ak are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational sti@@ pul@@ ling iron , as if it would explore transparent glass . I would like to explore the first few minutes of the universe , but we will never see it , since the judgment is revealed . &quot;
&quot; using Gra@@ vit@@ ational w@@ ellen , it should be possible to break down to the beginning . &quot;
&quot; and probably the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that we have never seen in all things we have never seen , and of which we do not have any idea . things we can only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the Light found in the first sight things we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at M@@ IT , Matt Evans , an important member of the LI@@ GO project , says to this topic : ME : the kind of stars , the black holes , like LI@@ GO they are observed , are the din@@ osaur@@ s of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , age @-@ old bodies from pre@@ historic times . the black holes are as to speak for our archae@@ ological work . &quot;
&quot; LI@@ GO makes us a completely different angle of view of the events in space , to the emergence of the stars and ultimately , as we went out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge now exists to be as cour@@ ageous as possible .
&quot; thanks to LI@@ GO , we know how to build great det@@ ectors , and the ro@@ ses of the cosmos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ at@@ ories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ at@@ ories on Earth and in space .
for what could be nic@@ er than the Ur@@ supp@@ er itself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
Dre@@ ams with us .
thanks .
a while ago I tried an experiment .
a year I would say to all &apos; yes ! &apos; I was afraid of which I was afraid .
&quot; no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak in the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to start with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , but yes , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly what to do , w@@ ov@@ or I fear@@ ed , fl@@ amed my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear , speeches to hold , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
&quot; but there was a particular Yes , which was deeply changed my life , on an un@@ expected art . it started with a question of my youn@@ gest . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls for un@@ explained reasons all &apos; k@@ ittens , &quot;
as if they were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; kis@@ sing , I need milk for my beak . &quot;
she asked me once I could play with her when I was on the le@@ ap . and I said : &quot; yes . &quot;
this yes was the beginning
&quot; a new attitude in my family . from there to swe@@ ar I always to play with them , as soon as you are doing so . no matter what I am doing , or where I go , I say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; fast . I am not perfect , but I like me very much . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , to my children , to our family . &quot;
but it also has an intri@@ gu@@ ing side effect : only recently I understood that the &apos; yes &apos; sent@@ ences to play with my children my career saved .
I have a real dream job .
I am author . I think of things you aw@@ ake to life .
dreams .
no .
I am a Titan .
dreams .
I create television . I produce produ@@ ci@@ er television .
&quot; I make television , in great style . &quot;
&quot; in this TV season , I am responsible for bringing about 70 hours of program to the world . &quot;
&quot; four television programs , 70 hours television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
&quot; each program provides hundreds of jobs , which is not existed before . &quot;
the budget for an episode of a TV channel can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
&quot; a new episode all nine days and four shows , so all nine days 20 million dollars television , four TV programs , three hours TV , three Shows , three episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my television sp@@ ies run on Thursday morning .
all over the world are running my series in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spect@@ ators .
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts which I have created themselves and not only produced , so yet ob@@ end@@ ly . I must find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans around camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four television programs , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bearing fire care around the world . &quot;
do you know who is this still doing ?
&quot; nobody , therefore I am a Titan . &quot;
dreams .
I would not want to im@@ press you with this .
&quot; I say it , because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls . &quot;
&quot; I tell you that all of you who work so hard if you &apos;re talking to a company , a country or a household , take seriously if I am talking about work , so you understand that I don &apos;t just talk on the computer that I am saying , I understand that it goes with a dream@@ job for dreams . &quot;
&quot; it is all a job , all work , all the reality , all blood , all swe@@ at -- no t@@ ears . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m working a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I am deep@@ ened in the work , there is no other sense . &quot;
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
&quot; it is , when I put troops up , when m@@ old I am on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; as a dream@@ y , you have a high sound , li@@ ven a mar@@ athon . &quot;
one feels like Be@@ yon@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; she is creative , mechanical , stren@@ uous , and in@@ toxic@@ ating , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ern@@ al , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ern@@ al , cru@@ el and reason@@ ably . and the best thing is the sums . &quot;
there is such a change in me when working well runs .
&quot; a sw@@ ings starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sums stops like a busy road , I could always go on her . &quot;
&quot; many people are taking , when I &apos;m talking to them the sw@@ elling that I talk to writing , that writing me joy . &quot;
do not understand myself wrong they do .
&quot; but the sums -- when I started working with television production when I began to work and work , to create and work together , I discovered this thing , this sums , this energy . the sw@@ ams ! &quot;
the sums is more than the writing .
the sums is action and activity . the sums is a threat .
the sums is music . the sums is light and air .
the sums of God is voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a sums , then you cannot count differently from the size . &quot;
&quot; the feeling of being no different from being able to strive as to the size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the sums .
or maybe it also means a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it is geni@@ us .
perhaps it is ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I do not know .
&quot; I know only that I am not afraid , and I just know that I love the sum@@ men . &quot;
&quot; I just want to say to you , I am a Titan , and I know that I do not want it to ask . &quot;
&quot; to make a clear one : the more I &apos;ll ever more broad@@ casts , the more sne@@ akers , the more work there , the more things the more , the more I write history , the more expectations are there . &quot;
&quot; the more I work , to be successful , the more you have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love job , do not come true ? &quot;
&quot; the land , which I car@@ afe , the mar@@ athon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high tone , the sums , the sums , the sums . &quot;
I like this sums . I love the sums .
I need the sums . I am the sw@@ elling .
am I only this sums ?
and then stops the sums .
&quot; revised , overweight , exag@@ ger@@ ated , burned down . &quot;
the sums stops .
&quot; now , my three daughters are acc@@ ust@@ omed to the truth that their m@@ um is a single labour market . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mom will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; kis@@ sing , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da Land . &quot;
there are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
you are Baby @-@ Tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the sums stopped . &quot;
the sw@@ elling of the motor pet@@ ri@@ fied .
I did not love my job anymore . the engine was off .
the sums did not come back .
my sw@@ elling was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ day , no rep@@ ent , nothing deleg@@ ates , a Titan sleeps , do not exist , with full heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no sums .
in me was silence .
&quot; four television programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four television programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a show @-@ Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was gray , I simply had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sw@@ elling and the sums I was .
&quot; so what makes you do , when what you do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ aded ? &quot;
&quot; I know , some may think : &quot; &quot; Heu@@ le thee , &quot; &quot; the author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but you know , you do it , you work , you are doing what you &apos;re doing is a teacher to be a teacher , a mother , Bill Gates , and knows how to stop the sw@@ inger , when the sw@@ ams stops , who is the sums up , who is one then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; if the song of my heart h@@ ears , I can survive in silence ? &quot;
and then put me my &quot; southern states @-@ Kell@@ ner@@ in &quot; a question .
&quot; I am on the way out there , late dr@@ an and she says : &quot; Mama , mag@@ st you playing ? &quot;
&quot; and I already want to say No , when I will be aware of two things : &quot;
&quot; first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , they called me not &quot; &quot; k@@ ittens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it does not call anyone &quot; &quot; k@@ ittens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when is this happening ?
&quot; I promise it when I am Titan am and my sw@@ ams , and here everything changes from my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says : &quot; &quot; Mama , &quot; you play ? &quot;
and I say : &quot; yes . &quot;
it is nothing special .
&quot; we are playing and their sisters encounter , we lau@@ gh a lot and I read completely dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in lon@@ eliness and the lack of sums , I cannot do anything except . &quot;
I am foc@@ uss@@ ed .
I am quietly .
&quot; the land I car@@ afe , the mar@@ athon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high tone - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; everything that exists are glu@@ ed finger and moist@@ ure kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax @-@ pins and the song that goes to Los@@ ses , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Eis@@ k@@ in &quot; . &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so close that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I am .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me is rede@@ emed .
a mental door goes on and an energy cir@@ ub comes .
&quot; and that is not immediately , but it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the sums comes back slowly .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it is quiet , hardly anything else , but it is there . &quot;
&quot; not the sums , but a sums . &quot;
and now I feel as if I would know a magical secret .
but let us stay with the matter .
it is love . this is all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the sums , the working environment , the fix@@ ings , that is only the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I am talking about ship@@ ments and television hours and how functional my brain is , then I forget what the real sw@@ ams is . &quot;
the sums is not strength and it is not a job @-@ specific .
it is dependent on joy .
true sums is dependent on love .
the sums is the power that comes from the lust of life .
true sums is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; true sums ignor@@ es the pressure of the story , which will be done to di@@ fy tasks , expect@@ ation and pressure . &quot;
true sums is simple and original .
&quot; true sums of God is voice in my ear , but maybe whis@@ per@@ ed God the wrong words , for which God said to me that I am a Titan Poker ? &quot;
it is simply love .
&quot; we all need a bit more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; once my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
I do this as a rule that I can free myself as a work@@ ah@@ olic of any fault .
&quot; it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice if I want to hear the sum@@ men again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I am not good in playing , I like it . &quot;
&quot; I do not play a cl@@ ue as well , as working . &quot;
the truth does hurt ;
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
&quot; I &apos;m working , because I love it . &quot;
I am better at work as a home .
&quot; it &apos;s pain@@ ful , because what a man is working rather than to be home ? &quot;
&quot; yes , I . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am to relaxed is none of it .
&quot; we shave in the garden around , before and back , and forth . &quot;
we do small dance parties ;
we sing and play ball .
we are bur@@ sting rop@@ es .
&quot; in doing so I feel mainly sti@@ ff , ab@@ sent and confused . &quot;
I always te@@ aches to my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the sums of the universe met me . &quot;
I play and play until I wonder : why have we ever heard with the games ?
you can also say it ! tell them always Yes when your child wants to play with you .
&quot; maybe you hold me for na@@ ï@@ ve , for a di@@ ver . &quot;
there you are quite right but you can also do it !
you have time !
and you also know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play a maximum of 15 minutes to me , until they agree that they want to do something else . &quot;
&quot; there are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes me will be replaced by Mari@@ enk@@ ä@@ fer or K@@ eks .
&quot; and speak my teen@@ y daughter whole 15 minutes long with me , I am mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; there are only 15 minutes , more it does not require . &quot;
&quot; each one can bring 15 minutes a piece , even at a tractor @-@ La@@ une @-@ day ! &quot;
15 minutes a piece !
&quot; no cell , no laundry , no distr@@ action . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children are ready . &quot;
but 15 minutes are inside !
&quot; my children are my well @-@ being , my world . there must not be the children . it is to feel the sw@@ ams to have a place for his soul &apos;s soul . &quot;
it is not about playing with your own children . it is about joy
around the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
treat yourself 15 minutes !
find out what you do good .
find it out and keep it out .
&quot; I am not perfect in it . I fail and I vic@@ tories . friends meet , books read , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; want to play ? &quot; stands shortly for everything I got up , when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training when I wanted to meet myself more and more . &quot;
&quot; 15 minutes in the piece , why not full 15 minutes of skill ? &quot;
what can it be wrong ? nothing !
the sums came back in my spare time . the sums seems to return when I &apos;m not working .
works not without games .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens up the door , and I find myself in my office . I hear a unknown mel@@ ody , they met me and my soul . I love me to new ideas . I use it in full breeding and love my work again . &quot;
&quot; I like the sw@@ ams , but I do not love it . &quot;
I do not need it .
I am not the sw@@ elling that sums is not me ... no more .
&quot; soap , and adhesive finger , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is now my sw@@ elling .
the sums of life .
the sums of love .
&quot; the sums of work is part of me , but just a part . and for this I am so grateful . &quot;
&quot; it is sorry to me that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem . &quot;
I said yes to less work and to more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my camp@@ fire still burn .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clear@@ er my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sw@@ elling . the land I sh@@ ades , the mar@@ athon , the mar@@ athon , the screen , the sums , the sums , the sums , the other , the sums of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sw@@ elling , the more this unusual , sc@@ end , naked and new life @-@ feeling in me wide . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this sums , the more I know who I am . &quot;
I am author . I think of things I aw@@ ake you to life .
&quot; this belongs to the job , which means to live its dream . &quot;
&quot; that is the dream of this job , &quot;
for a dream@@ job should be a little dream@@ y .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and to more games .
titles have no chance here .
&quot; want to play ? &quot;
thanks .
I am Neuro@@ surgery .
like most of my colleagues every day I have to do with human trag@@ e@@ dies .
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a heavy stroke or a car accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ surge@@ ons it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other bodi@@ ly organs , has a very low capacity to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a severe violation of the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , heavy disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I have functional neuro@@ surgical surgical procedure .
what is a functional neuro@@ surge@@ on ?
a doctor that tries to improve the ner@@ ve functions through various surgical measures .
&quot; surely they have heard of one of the most known ones , the &quot; deep underground stimulation . &quot; thereby , one impl@@ ements one electro@@ de deeply in the brain in order to influence the cir@@ cuits of the neur@@ ons so that neuro@@ logical function can be improved . &quot;
&quot; it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Par@@ kin@@ son , which suffered severe trem@@ ors and heavy pain . &quot;
Neuro@@ modul@@ ation however does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream functional neuro@@ surge@@ on is the recovery of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to .
with some help the brain can help themselves .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was leading nur@@ sing and worked during the emergency day and night in the emergency .
often I aw@@ ed patients with sk@@ ull @-@ deer trau@@ ma .
they must imagine that at sk@@ ull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ mat@@ a the brain domin@@ ates and the sk@@ ull @-@ pressure push .
to save life you have to dimin@@ ish the sk@@ ull pressure .
&quot; to do this , you sometimes have to remove a part of cotton brain . &quot;
&quot; instead of creating the cur@@ ed priests , we decided to analyze with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , the brain . &quot;
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; to let cells have grown from a tissue type , comparable with very small children that will be taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; you have to find the right diet , temperature , moist@@ ure and the environments to maintain them . &quot;
this is precisely what we had to do with these cells .
after many tra@@ inees it made Jean @-@ François .
this was what he saw under his micro@@ scope .
this was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with great green cells that are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells . &quot;
&quot; maybe you still know from the Bi@@ ology lessons , that stem cells un@@ ri@@ pe cells are , which can turn into each cell type of the organism . &quot;
&quot; the adult brain has stem cell cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain . &quot;
it is surprisingly to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain cells in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast .
they never die ; they are imm@@ ort@@ al .
but these cells have been different .
they shared slowly and after a couple of weeks they died even .
&quot; so we saw a new , wei@@ rd cell population , who saw how stem cells saw , but was different . &quot;
we needed long to understand how he came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells hot Dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
you make 4 % of our grand@@ pri@@ st@@ ine cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
&quot; at the stage of the fet@@ us , they ensure the folding of the brain . &quot;
but why stay they received ?
we do not know .
&quot; we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we can find them in higher concent@@ rations . &quot;
but this is not that safe .
but one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells .
&quot; we stand in front of a potential cell source , the brain healing . &quot;
this we had to prove .
&quot; so , we decided to develop an experiment . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to take a piece of brain from the non @-@ lingu@@ istic field , and then the cells will be as cultiv@@ ate as Jean @-@ François . &quot;
and they were then colour@@ ful to cut them in the brain .
in the last step we rei@@ m@@ pl@@ ed it to the dra@@ in@@ age of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ ologist Tran@@ splan@@ tation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
&quot; one of our first questions was : what happens when we do these cells in normal brain tissue , and what will happen if we do the same cells in damaged bra@@ ve tissues ? &quot;
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we could work with monkeys .
&quot; in the first scenario we travel@@ ed the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that they were completely disappeared after a few weeks , they were taken back home . the space is already occupied , they will not disappear there , so they will not disappear . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario , we put an injury to and rei@@ m@@ pl@@ ed exactly the same cells and now remained the cells -- they washed up to mature neur@@ ons . &quot;
here you see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been rei@@ m@@ pl@@ ed .
&quot; the proof that they show are these small points . these are the cells that we are in vit@@ ro , in culture . &quot;
&quot; here , we could not stop . &quot;
&quot; help these cells also a monkey , to recover from a brain injury ? &quot;
&quot; so , we are trained monkeys with a manual skill . &quot;
you had to take feed feed from one tray .
they made them very well .
&quot; when they had achieved a stable skill level , we last in the mot@@ oric Cortex the Hand@@ mot@@ oric section . &quot;
&quot; then , the monkeys were par@@ aly@@ sed , they could no longer move her hand anymore . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen to people , they re@@ juven@@ ate spont@@ ane@@ ously up to a certain degree , just as after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; patients are par@@ aly@@ zed , and then try to recover with the help of plastic bra@@ ins mechanisms . they rest at some degree , just like the monkey . &quot;
&quot; when we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , impl@@ anted , we impl@@ anted his own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left you see the monkey , which is spontaneous . &quot;
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original power in front of injury .
it is not as precise and not so fast .
&quot; now , see when we have the cells rei@@ m@@ pl@@ ed : the same re@@ efs , two months after the irrit@@ ation . &quot;
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
&quot; since that time , we have found a lot more about these cells . &quot;
we can use them free@@ ze and later use .
&quot; we can use them in other neuro@@ path@@ ological models , for example at Par@@ kin@@ son . &quot;
&quot; but our dream is still , it is still to impl@@ anted by the people . &quot;
I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal themselves .
many thanks .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ ely@@ ne , this is wonderful , I am sure now , several do@@ zen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who need it . &quot;
I definitely definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on the human being . &quot;
&quot; J@@ oc@@ ely@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , one has to fill about two kil@@ ograms papers and forms to run this kind of studies . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is understand@@ able , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical studies . if you continue to look into the future as many years it takes , until someone can get into hospital and that therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : this is hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the authorisation of the clinical study . &quot;
will it allow us the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it takes a long time to select the patient , to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment . &quot;
then you have to apply this to a multi @-@ cent@@ ric study .
you have to really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment .
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : natural . &quot;
BG : J@@ oc@@ ely@@ ne thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it .
BG : many thanks .
democracy .
&quot; we in the West make a big mistake , it as of course to consider . &quot;
&quot; we do not see democracy as the frag@@ ile plant that is in reality , but as the invent@@ ory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider them as un@@ changing opponents .
we believe that capitalism is inev@@ it@@ ably led to democracy .
this is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and its great dess@@ ert in Beijing have doub@@ ted that it is quite possible to have a blo@@ oming capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the democracy comes with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ ambig@@ uous that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- does not have the austerity measures expected in Greece . &quot;
&quot; in this moment , I thought that there could be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party , or some of my expenses could be repeated that democracy would be abol@@ ished when they would alter anything . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy . &quot;
&quot; I ask you , together with me , again to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group , we could save the democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ ective democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy , our societies become painted , our future glo@@ omy and our great , new technologies are wast@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; on the topic of waste , I would like to point out about an interesting contradiction , which is currently threat@@ ening our economies . &quot;
I call it the &quot; tw@@ ins summit @-@ parad@@ ox . &quot;
&quot; a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the Schul@@ den@@ berg , who thro@@ ws its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; all of us recognize the Schul@@ den@@ berg , &quot;
but few recognize its tw@@ illing .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to ob@@ serving austerity and corporations that could be too an@@ xi@@ ous to invest where it would be productive and in@@ comes with which one could urgently needed the debt recovery and also all the things that mankind could urgently need for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; over the past 3 months in the United States , in England and in the eurozone , 3.4 tr@@ illion expected goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , gli@@ ding , equipment and so on and so on . &quot;
&quot; 3.4 tr@@ illion US dollars sounds like a lot of money , until one compar@@ es with the 5,@@ 1 tr@@ illion US dollars , which at the same time have been around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing else except the flan@@ ges and the real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus , debts and un@@ productive capital form the forced summit , which is not the same by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result are stag@@ nat@@ ing wages , more than one quarter of 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ old in the United States , Japan and Europe , and consequently , a low total economic demand , which would affect them in which they do not invest in which they would not kill him if he will grow , &quot;
&quot; thank@@ ed the circumstances lead , which lead to that eco @-@ pus trav@@ ills him . &quot;
this is my ha@@ iry with capitalism --
&quot; its extremely connect@@ edness . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , improving human tal@@ ents , and particularly all of the technologies to finance , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial to save the earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
but before we are going on . but before we continue : what do we mean in democracy ?
Arist@@ otel@@ es defined democracy as the social form in which the open and poor to control the poor as a majority .
the ath@@ ic democracy closed naturally too many --
&quot; women , foreig@@ ners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to dimin@@ ish the significance of the ath@@ ic democracy due to these degrees . &quot;
&quot; the decision of the ath@@ ic democracy was and is that she gave the working poor , not only the right to freedom of expression , but is more important and crucial that they have the right to political co @-@ determination with equal voting in issues of the state . &quot;
the ath@@ ic democracy has not been held for a long time --
&quot; like a cand@@ le , which is very bright , it is also quickly burned . &quot;
&quot; however , our present liberal democr@@ acies have not their roots in the ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; whereas the ath@@ ic democracy focused on free citizens , and the working poor stronger , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which was ultimately a stat@@ ute for the ruling class . &quot;
&quot; for the liberal democracy came only to , as a complete separation of politics and economy , and the democratic process of politics became apparent during the economy -- so the world of the concert -- was a democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in our current democr@@ acies there since the time , in which this separation of politics and economy began to take an un@@ preced@@ ented struggle between the two by taking the economy gradually deteri@@ or@@ ated them . &quot;
wonder@@ s why the politicians are no longer like they used to be ?
it is not about a de@@ generation of their DNA .
&quot; it is because one cannot be in the government today , and yet in power , because the power of politics in the economy is ab@@ ander@@ ed and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my ha@@ iry with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is about just like a flo@@ ck of rob@@ ber that sustain@@ ing so sustainable the animals , of which they nour@@ ished , that it is therefore star@@ vation in the end . &quot;
&quot; it is similar to the economy , which outlines the policy so far as can@@ nib@@ als . the power of corporations are growing , political goods are increasing , the overall economic demand falls and the managing director of the corporations are too cold , the bar@@ gain of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the successful of capitalism the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; s@@ ells out of democracy , the higher the tw@@ ist summit , and all the greater the waste of human labour power and prosperity of hum@@ ank@@ ind . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s true that we need to bring together politics and the economy , and it would be better when doing the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; control , as in the ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , the women and the foreig@@ ners . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go well .
&quot; the teaching from the Deb@@ ak@@ el of the Soviet Union should be , that the working poor is to re@@ produce a position as in the ancient Athens without new species of brut@@ ality and waste . &quot;
but there is one solution : the working poor !
capitalism is doing it by using Ni@@ ed@@ rig@@ l@@ hn@@ able by automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is to be higher , so long economy and politics are separate , the automation can be higher and the social conflicts deeper , as it is -- as soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come . &quot;
&quot; so we have to ren@@ ew the economy and re@@ unite the areas of business and politics , and considering that we have the re@@ united area of more democratic , otherwise we end up in a uni@@ fied surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which can appear as a documentary &quot; matrix &quot; such as documentation . &quot;
&quot; so the question is not , whether capitalism has brought the technical achievements that he has brought , survive -- &quot;
&quot; the most interesting question is whether capitalism is dis@@ solved by a Dy@@ lan@@ ie , similar to the &quot; matrix , &quot; in the machines to serve the people and people put their energy into the study of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ os &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks with the meaning of life . &quot;
I believe we may be optim@@ istic .
&quot; so what could it look , how could it look to have these &quot; Star Trek &quot; like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ similar Dy@@ lan@@ ie ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples in all soon . &quot;
&quot; in the field of companies : ask for a capital market , in which you &apos;re worthy of money while you work and in which your capital follows you from a job site , from a company to the next , and the company -- regardless of which you just work -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company . &quot;
then all income from capital and rede@@ em and the concept of wage labor is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the companies , but they do not work in it , and employees who are working there . no exchange between capital and labour , no big g@@ aps between investment and sp@@ ars , and ultimately not an em@@ por@@ ous tw@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy , please note that our national currencies would have a free flu@@ ctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of the whole of humanity . &quot;
&quot; imagine that the entire world trade trading in this currency will be tra@@ ded -- let &apos;s call them &quot; the cosmos &quot; , &quot; in units of &quot; Kos@@ mos &quot; &quot; -- and every government pays the sum , which corresponds to the defic@@ it or the trade agreement of the respective country , into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; also imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world , in which investment . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes was suggested in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time not the technical means had to implement it .
&quot; today , we have them , especially in the background of a united policy and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe , is at the same time being liber@@ ated , in which she preferred to privileged people , and Marxist , because they buried the separation of capital and labour in the inv@@ ali@@ d of history , and key@@ n@@ esian , global key@@ n@@ esian . &quot;
but above all others it is a world where we can imagine real democracy .
we are awakening in such a world
or will we move into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar Dy@@ lan@@ y ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
&quot; it is in our hands , and we do it better democratic . &quot;
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography itself as a liber@@ ary Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I have just said , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... do we do not realize the technological development a massive decline in the overall economic demand , what Lar@@ ry sum@@ mers as &quot; long @-@ term st@@ agn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by transfer@@ ring this crisis from a part of the earth to the next , as we experience it , not only our democr@@ acies is dest@@ abil@@ ising , but also the countries , whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is correct , Marx is quite relevant . &quot;
&quot; as Hay@@ ek , therefore I am a liber@@ t@@ ary Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am also completely wir@@ es . &quot;
&quot; BG : actually , and now we are probably too . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you do not agree , you do not think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Ein@@ stein , who said that . BG : in your talk , Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of speakers have you very clearly stated what you think about the sight of the West in China . &quot;
would you repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democr@@ acies we have the voucher of democracy .
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy toward politics during the area where most of the economy is playing , -- the area of economy -- a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in a certain point , if I may say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China today resem@@ bles the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; because -- do you remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is an error , historically considered . &quot;
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , how John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
&quot; he was particularly skep@@ tical , which concerns the democratic development . &quot;
&quot; what you can now watch in China , resem@@ bles very the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; China now have to conf@@ ess that , what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ elling abo@@ unded to hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many listen@@ ers are curious about your experiences as a financial minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I suppose that it comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later to the first half of the year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal vision , and very dis@@ appoint@@ ing , because we had the opportunity to take a new beginning with the Eurozone . &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; namely , to administ@@ ered us from the self @-@ suffici@@ ency and the continuous den@@ ial is that a massive displac@@ ement line was passed through the Eurozone and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened with the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , based on Greek demonstrations -- the way , the first proposal was that this den@@ ial is obvious -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro zone , within the European group , continue to den@@ ial the den@@ ial . &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one is trying to get an economic system that is not far @-@ viable , through political will and author@@ it@@ ism in life it will perhaps be able to delay a while , but when change occurs , it happens ab@@ rupt and destru@@ c@@ tive . &quot;
BG : what change do you see ahead ?
&quot; Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future , if we do not change its construction . &quot;
BG : do you have made any mistakes in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- seri@@ ousness ...
&quot; if there is a finance minister , or any Minister , who claims after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he claimed no mistakes , then it is a dangerous person . &quot;
&quot; of course , I made mistakes . &quot;
the greatest mistake was to sign the request for the extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honor@@ ary interest in the pages of the don@@ ors to find a common solution .
but that was not .
&quot; they just wanted to bring our government only because they did not want to deal with the ship@@ ments , who lose through the eurozone . &quot;
they didn &apos;t want to admit that she has led a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nomin@@ ee GDP .
&quot; there is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; none of the tro@@ ika credi@@ tors who has imposed on this policy , gest@@ ed us : &quot; &quot; this was a colonial fault . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive table of talks , you seem to be quite a pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is facing someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot;
my greatest fear is that the eurozone is not survi@@ ved .
&quot; for if they do not survive , the frei@@ ght fly @-@ forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not be cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences alone for Europe but for the entire global economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; when we turn ourselves the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , what it appears to me , it will be also unbe@@ ar@@ able for the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong in that point .
Yan@@ is , thank you very much for you were with TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thanks .
&quot; from Ro@@ y Price , most never heard , although it is probably responsible for 22 medium @-@ moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for a lot of you . &quot;
this is going back to the decision that Ro@@ y met three years ago .
Ro@@ y Price is introduc@@ tory pri@@ mor@@ ter at Amazon Studios ;
the TV @-@ production company from Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a long@@ term and describes itself on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technology , T@@ aco@@ s . &quot;
Ro@@ y has a very important job because it is responsible for which shows the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fight industry . &quot;
there are so many TV series that Ro@@ y can not choose any one .
&quot; he has to find shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he must find shows that are quite right on this turn . &quot;
&quot; this cur@@ ve is the assessment of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ D@@ b website . the review dates from 1 to 10 , and the height shows how many shows this review received . &quot;
&quot; your show will be valued at nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; Bre@@ aking Bad &quot; , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wir@@ e &quot; -- all the shows , the ad@@ dic@@ tive , where you ask a season , your brain asks : &quot; where is there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left hand side , here at this end , shows how &quot; Tod@@ d@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; -- -- this should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the cur@@ ve . &quot;
Ro@@ y Price does not take effect on the left side of the cur@@ ve because I think one needs special intelligence to provide &quot; Tod@@ d@@ lers and Ti@@ aras . &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the average balance , the average television -- the shows that neither good nor poor@@ ly , they just do not inspire . &quot;
so he must make sure he really is on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing something , that is why Ro@@ y Price is going to risk nothing . &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and cho@@ oses with eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online where they can watch everyone for free . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon is going out there , it is still going to be right ? &quot;
millions of viewers will look at these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they will be observed when watching these shows . &quot;
they are observed by Ro@@ y and his team to record everything .
&quot; you capture , when you start the show when you break down , which parts you may ski@@ p , or look at once again . &quot;
&quot; they collect millions of data to decide using this data , which show they should produce . &quot;
&quot; in fact they collect the data , process these and resulting from the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com on four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that many people remember this show because she was not so good . &quot;
&quot; it is only an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this turn 7,@@ 4 amounts and Alpha House lan@@ det at 7,5 -- so something above average , but not exactly what we worked on Ro@@ y and his team . &quot;
&quot; about at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top @-@ show by data analysis . its name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of net@@ fli@@ x . just like Ro@@ y he is always looking for to find this a super show and he does it also use data for it , but it makes things different . &quot;
&quot; instead of holding a competition , he and his team gave their existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews that they give the shows , their course , which shows them etc . &quot;
then use these data to find these little details about the audience : what shows they like what producers which actors .
&quot; when they had together all the parts , they entered a wag@@ on and decided not to make a Sit@@ com on four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; . Net@@ fli@@ x has managed to hit a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 review on this cur@@ ve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
&quot; of course , the question is : what happened here ? &quot;
one has two very com@@ peti@@ tive , data sealed . &quot;
they connect to this many data and it works great for one of them but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic is somehow domin@@ ating that this should work with everything .
&quot; if you coll@@ ects millions of data , for a decision that you meet , then you should make a good decision . &quot;
it has 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
we optim@@ ised it by very powerful computer .
&quot; what you can expect , is good television , or ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis is not working so , then this is a little sc@@ ary because we are living in a time when we take more and more to statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
does someone know here the company multi @-@ Health Systems ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one can ever get in this room with this software . come in touch with that you are in prison .
&quot; if someone is in prison in prison and to dism@@ is@@ sal , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if an dischar@@ ge is done or not . &quot;
&quot; just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad , a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate television , 22 minutes , this can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
&quot; not always created the best results . this is not always that a company like multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data . &quot;
even the data sealed companies are wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; 2009 announced Google to know that by data analysis breaks out of flu , the lim@@ b way , pre@@ dictions , -- by data analysis of the Google &apos;s research . &quot;
it worked wonderful and was a great news item . the success gi@@ fted in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked impeccable , year around year after year until there was suddenly no more working , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it simply does not work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data is sealed companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes something .
&quot; despite all these errors flows in decisions of life a -- on the workplace , in the legal framework , in medicine . &quot;
&quot; so , we should rather make sure that data are helpful . &quot;
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ used gen@@ etics -- an area where some very smart people un@@ imagin@@ able lots of data to make serious decisions , as the decision for a cancer therapy &quot;
or the development of a medicine . over the years I have recognised some patterns over the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions .
&quot; you need to solve a complex problem , do not do two things : &quot;
&quot; as a First , you set up this problem in its parts , so you can analyze the spare parts ; as a second set you put the items again to put a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you need to do this several times , but there are always two things : apart and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help create a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to re@@ en@@ force the parts and then come to a decision .
&quot; for this , there is another tool and we all possess all of our brain . &quot;
&quot; when there is something that is good when the brain is good , it is parts and pieces back again , even if the information is in@@ complete , so if the information is in@@ complete , especially when it is the brain of a expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore I think it was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful because they have data and mind , where they are also executed in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience , for what else would not have been capable of . but the decision , how to put all of these parts , and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; , &quot; that did not stand in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show which meant that they entered a great personal risk with this decision .
&quot; on the other hand , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way . &quot;
&quot; they use data to control all their decisions , first as they have a TV ideas , then as they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; they say to us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe that things go wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are only a tool and not to forget that this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . it is amazing . for decisions using a ja@@ - or no question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- exactly here at this moment .
I will see it later with an Techni@@ k@@ demo .
I have so far made some decisions in my life so I should have heard in the ball on the ball .
&quot; but , as you of course know if you have the data available , you would like to replace that by something much un@@ used , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic building .
&quot; so perhaps the ball kl@@ ü@@ ger and kl@@ ü@@ ger , and l@@ ush . ultimately , it is possible to make decisions when we want to reach something special at the end of the right corner . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the great amount of data always pays to make decisions , an expert in what you do , and to address the risks . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it is not the data but the risks with which you end up at the right end of the cur@@ ve . &quot;
thanks .
