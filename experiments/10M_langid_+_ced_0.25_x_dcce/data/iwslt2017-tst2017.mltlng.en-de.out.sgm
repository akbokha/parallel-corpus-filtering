<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before the someone had heard of Edward Snowden, he wrote cren a book in which he was spectacular that the NSA had illegally released by Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But there is another chapter which should leave an abiding impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence cooperation, which was literally crowded for nuclear bomb for an atomic bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">If the crazy sounds you read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapters do not coincide?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government has been determined against cracks and called on him to call its own sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this train, he became a symbol for the pattern of the government, whistleblowers to condemn and journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to First Constitutional, the media has the right to release secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"however, it is impossible to apply this right if media cannot get these information and if they cannot protect their identity of the sea."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so as the government at Risen anchoring, he did something that many brave reporters already did before him: he refused and said that he would rather go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, crates lived together with risk to go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, only days before the process, adapted something extraordinary."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although they had years of years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped on risk."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the period of electronic monitoring the reporters can become less and less hidden.</seg>
<seg id="19">"rather than to extern and crying to the statements, that could also carry out its digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and thus the mediator, without his consent, his phone numbers are secretly concerned,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just as its e-mail data, financial and bank information, its credit card, and even irritating with the list of its flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA Whistleblowers and Risens."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is just one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers. but instead the judiciary has more convicted more than all US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government is going on too much of her work as a secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, nearly every article on national security was the result of being a whistleblowers to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"thus we put the press work on the game, which shall be protected by the first constitutional order, because the government has more and more possibilities to hide all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"however, just as technology of the government allowed to handle the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"while they can take it from the moment in which they get in contact, rather than in the afterward, in the witness."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today's communication software, which it has not yet existed as crack his book had written, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open source system for whistleblowers, which was originally developed by the internet of Aaron, which has been developed by us, and is now being developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation where I have been developed further."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of send an e-mail, go to a news site, just like the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents or send information, just as with any usual contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">"these are then encrypted and stored on a server, which only has access to the respective news agency."</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government can no longer be adversed, and many of the information that would call it, would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">"however, SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century."</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world are always new espionet technologies that all of us endanger us."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is to make sure that not only technology, such as Edward Snowden have an opportunity to insure misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblowers,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"who want to report about abuse in the supply of soldiers and report by crowded hospitals. or the next environmental colleague, the alarm goes to the seated waters of Flint. or a Wallstreet-Insider that warns us before the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crimes but to protect our all constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">"[on 3 April 2016, the largest dateeck of history was published.] [the" "Panama Papers" "[what does this mean?] [we bates Robert Palmer from Global Wrenditions to a statement.] this week we were conducted by news about a Leck of 11 million documents in Panama - Fonseca Moselle Fonseca."</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers to companies such as Mospack Fonseca and say," okay, we need an anonymous company. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the emails, the exchange of news, as the whole system works, as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">"also, there are reports that a ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Baschar al-Assad has stems in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is argued that a donation of 2 billion US dollars to Russia President Vladimir Putin guides, about a narrow friend of children's ages, a famous cellists."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people and others that are nervous about the next publication, and the next unveiling documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Well that sounds like the Plot of an agent or a John-Grisham-ROMANS.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems to be wept away from you, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we start what?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and mighty in the situation are to hide their assets in tax havens and not all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, streets."</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Wrenal, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"all over the world discuss media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens are used by some of them to hide and wear them -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people appears this whole world very confusing, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine like a Matryoschema.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind this prayer."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it may be very difficult for criminal law and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what thing is."</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it also interesting that in the USA there are less reports of this matter.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably, because there have been no prominent Americans in these revelations, this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">"well, it is not so that there are no wealthy Americans to hide their assets in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="65">"but through the principle, after these tax havens work, Mosbag Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a data from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples to have connections to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is so that in some US states need less information to provide less information to create a company than to get a librarian form."</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparent in the US has allowed employees of shoulders allowed to descend schoolchildren.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed scams to rip especially anxious investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Waders we wanted to find out how all this in practice looks.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does this actually work?</seg>
<seg id="73">"so, we sent a covered agent into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan."</seg>
<seg id="74">"our mediator gave himself as African minister, which wanted to bring much money into the United States to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">"we really shocked it really, that all through on a lawyer of our intermediary proposals made how he could transfer his money."</seg>
<seg id="76">"these were all predominant. none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course anyone was given to the money. but it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as individuals.</seg>
<seg id="78">"it is not about a single lawyer, which has undermines proposals."</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single leaders that transforms into a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, through the corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to cope with this, we must change the rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound all very trendy, as if we could do nothing about it; as if nothing could ever have changed; as if it is always the rich and mighty."</seg>
<seg id="84">"but as a-born Optimist, I see that some things have begun to change."</seg>
<seg id="85">"over the past few years, we have witnessed more transparency in the past few years, regarding what the owners of companies are concerned."</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic took political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 Summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU is captured in central registers at national level who really is behind companies in Europe and who is controlled."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the USA is behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have brought a lawyer in both parliamentarians, but this does not make progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how this Panama disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and global."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Wong this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">"we need ordinary people who are angry when they see, how other people can hide their real identity behind hunting firms."</seg>
<seg id="93">"we need executives in the economy, which stand up and say," Intransparent is not good for the business. "</seg>
<seg id="94">"we need leading politicians who realise the problem and campaigning to end this way, by laws this kind of intransparent."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can finish the Intransparent, which now enables this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">"this is the story, as I had almost kidnapped almost once and in the trunk of a red Mazdas."</seg>
<seg id="97">"a day after I completed my design school, I made a backdrop."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda still stand and look my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and made straight a road trip all the country. afterwards he would go to peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him on a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"as we paid the invoice, I made the mistake to ask him:" where do you blame? "</seg>
<seg id="104">"he made the whole thing worse," I know not yet. "</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, Man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What can I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sofa bed?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him! he says he would go to peace corps, but I don't know if he really is planning. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazet!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I listened to say: "I have a bubbling. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"said a voice in my head:" "uh, as please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I was in bed, I was rigid to the blanket and thought:" "Oh Man! what I got in rockin?"</seg>
<seg id="114">A wildder sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I went out of the bed, to the door to door, and my sleeping door."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">"the artwork that he had bought by me, depends today in his classroom. he is now teacher."</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">"maybe the people who were sold to me in childhood as a strangers, actually friends who just waiting to be discovered."</seg>
<seg id="122">"people on my airmat, was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air."</seg>
<seg id="123">"let's take a time, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost plague, my roommates are moving and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">"I believe, creativity can create it to transform fear into fun."</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote my best friend and new roommates Brian Chesky:" Brian, I survived, how we could make something for a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, including a mattress and every morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha!</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded as "air-ratze and breakfast" [AIRBed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests allowed to sleep with us for 20 dollars on the air-bar on woodwinds.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I am sure, our cheese-ham-Omeletes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we traveled with them through the whole city. when we have farewell our last guest and the door to the castle fell, rigid Brian and I felt."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay for our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out whether to make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we presented to the Investors:" we would like to create a website, on the people of public pictures from their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms, their rooms, whose doors are closed if you visit. "</seg>
<seg id="139">"over the Internet, they can invite you to invite you to stay with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the missile inflammation.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not act.</seg>
<seg id="143">"nobody else, who is still at Trost, would invest in a store, strangers to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we have learned as children all that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem showing you on the things you can get good. we were able to designate.</seg>
<seg id="147">"at the Kunstakademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the overall experience."</seg>
<seg id="148">"we had learned how to create objects design, but now we wanted to create more immense trust between people who had never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design achieve something?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">"I would like to give you a heater, what degree trust we strive."</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-seconds experiment. it will force you from your comfort.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">"now, I would like to share your mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="156">Type your entangled phone to your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">"this quietly excursion of panic, you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door the door."</seg>
<seg id="158">"because the only one, which is more personal than your mobile phone, your home is."</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold a stranger in the hands of a stranger?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">"so, most guests feel when they can stay elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="163">"only for this reason, our company can exist."</seg>
<seg id="164">Just time so who has actually Al Gores Mobile?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you declare to Twitter on Twitter that he accused for the office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You now have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we have changed a little detail about this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor had to be imagined once with his name; if he told, where he comes, how his dog or his children are called?"</seg>
<seg id="170">"imagine you would have 150 Beuressments that all say," he can really stick very well-erred handys! "</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you would have to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-made feedback system strengthens the confidence decisive.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we have done some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for the people to be adverse negative positions.</seg>
<seg id="175">"ultimately, we decided to wait until both host and guest had given their Beurals before we set them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we have discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we have carried out a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how they are similar to old age and residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprising we trust the people most familiar to us most.</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less trust we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social pre-perceived.</seg>
<seg id="181">Exciting will make when you add the reputation of a person -- in our case by Beurism.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three assessments, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but, one has more than ten, changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation of similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can thus help us overcome some of our deeply rooted precautions.</seg>
<seg id="186">"furthermore, we erected that confidence is dependent on how much you can get from itself."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"when you tell too little as for example," Hi! ", one gets more of an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"one tells us a lot, as for example:" I have problems with my mother "-- -- -- the request is also not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g." Tolle artwork in your apartment! I make a holiday with my family holiday. "</seg>
<seg id="191">How can we create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text box to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips to which subjects you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">"our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices towards foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="194">"what we had not counted, the great multitude of people who were more than willing to put these prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people will take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">Firstly: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">"second, the tireless work of our team."</seg>
<seg id="199">"thirdly, a need that was not covered before."</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business is very good.</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are also times when it is not everything smooth."</seg>
<seg id="202">"there were guests, the unallowed parties celebrated or apartments wander."</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">"I stood at the front front, when trust was broken."</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing unlimmeres than this calls. I already hurts if I think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">"the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the anrufer, it was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve."</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, there had only one fraction on behalf of 123 million in the average."</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trust each other to justice.</seg>
<seg id="210">When trust works can be a miracle.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host was driving him to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donate blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his judgement:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect house for travellers to escape the activities due to heart infectious diseases.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with enough hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real protective angels who save lives of life, even though they don't know."</seg>
<seg id="218">"you drive a car into the hospital when you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want to feel lonely put them books.</seg>
<seg id="220">They can even stay longer without having to calculate the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So of course does not run every stay.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I stumbled upon this term, I asked me:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is about an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but it is now simply called" "hiring industry", "the thing is not just righteous."</seg>
<seg id="228">"share Economy describes a trade, the human relationships promises."</seg>
<seg id="229">People place a part of itself open and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">"if you do nowadays, this is easy to compare with Fast Food. it is efficient and reliable, but it is less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">"what would however, if travelling a rich buffet from local impressions would be?"</seg>
<seg id="232">"what would be, if at any place, you would be visited, a group there would wait to fill a group of filling and one with a bar pentine quarter of which one has never heard."</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if cooking could learn from a five-star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">"nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy."</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to shape apartments from the ground on together?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What would be if cities would take the thoughts of the common share?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships, instead of loneliness and attenuation."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in the Southern Coreas capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking that belonged to the government,"</seg>
<seg id="240">"now investors were offered. students, who were looking for a lead,"</seg>
<seg id="241">"were conveys to people whose children were passed. it became incubator programs,"</seg>
<seg id="242">"to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. through our platform alone, 50 000 people will be hosted in 191 countries at a stranger or self."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems not to be as crazy as it was brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We have not invented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was there before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has exactly our works?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from luck and Timing, we realize that you can find the right design with the components of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome profound prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">"I find that intriguing,"</seg>
<seg id="251">Quite overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about what a red Mazda pass over to me.</seg>
<seg id="253">"of course, we know that design cannot solve any problem."</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you see me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, a brain-undering underwear, a terrorist attack?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in vulnerabilities at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">"thus, the media people represent, which look like me."</seg>
<seg id="264">A study carried out that 80% of reporting about Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans mean that most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people do not speak to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">"for all those who have never met a Muslim, it is great to know you."</seg>
<seg id="268">I say to you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">"I am introverted,"</seg>
<seg id="271">"furniture-fitness-gym,"</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga Sings, because, baby, I was not so born."</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do this.</seg>
<seg id="275">"when I was 17 years old, I met the decision to outing me."</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as a homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as Muslims min. I chose Hijab, my head."</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friendships were kidnapped: "why are you oppressed?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the funny was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, and opposite to the pressure I felt as 17-year-old, to adapt to a perfect and untouchable beauty."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have been with the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought to, asked in question, desperate and credible ultimately."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>

<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned into emptment quickly.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should you do something?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I alternate the television kanal and heard:"... muslimische terrorists "..."... in the name of Islam... "..."... "like..."... "... Zerhad...", "... Zerbombs Mecca!"</seg>

<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and begin with the European integration process."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember how I went -- as we were frightening -- so deep it went into my seat, and I was afraid to be recognized as Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we went to our apartment in our apartment, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then heard, saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said," "watchful," "Seid carefully," "lead in well illuminated areas," "Versammmelt you not."</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday during that week -- the day when Muslims are gathering to prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings:" does not go on this first Friday, the mosque might be a goal. "</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the vast coverage of reporting.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were unmistaken, and I heard also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who kept for Muslims, to the open hand, and struck."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really brandy on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something felt not really right.</seg>
<seg id="314">"because people who had attacked this country, our country attacked."</seg>
<seg id="315">I took the anger of the people on terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to declare yourself well.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing to ask questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">"these are the accusations, which are hard."</seg>
<seg id="320">"nowadays, we can actually say people:" there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims. "</seg>

<seg id="322">Some people want to join Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It's just the question: are we malicious or good-good?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumor removes as a whole and a benign tumor just under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are, like all the other Americans, no tumor in the body of the USA, but a vital organ."</seg>

<seg id="332">"the regular visit of a mosque leads to see people's other belief, and to show greater civil participation."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a leader of the police in the Washington, DC recently told, people are actually not radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radiated in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"when the radicalization process has noticed that it starts online. as a First person, the person believes that the person believes that the person believes the true Muslims, and everyone who despises their behavior and ideology, is a traitor or by faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalisation, we need to stop people to go to the mosque."</seg>

<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam such as Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology reasons on their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but if one throws a look at it, it does not drive what they do in their" Holy Bible. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that it can read these things in Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she would have spoken to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she was in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said, the problem was exactly the opposite. every clergy with whom she had spoken, brought her to silence, and told her that their wrath, their sense of injustice in the world, it would only bring them into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that had given her anger sense, it was a main object for the instrumentalisation by extremists that you have a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam placed the link to God and her church again.</seg>
<seg id="352">"rather than to blame for their anger, he showed their constructive paths for a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what they learned in the mosque, she kept them to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how the Islamophobia and my family concerns.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect anyone?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear that at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept an authoritarian government system to conform and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study shows: if you have reviews messages, in which negative about Muslims was reported, they have more military attacks on Muslim countries and the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academy problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"when you look at when the mood against Muslims came to the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the advance of Iraq war and during two periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">"so Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Moslem terror, as I expected it."</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool to manipulation the public to make the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well-informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">The handling of Muslims is a early emblem.</seg>
<seg id="367">"maybe we may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear shuffled us all."</seg>
<seg id="368">"in the assignment of collectividly, it is not just about to explain itself."</seg>

<seg id="380">Are we going to the mosque or stayed safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we possessed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was that America we want to leave our children: one that would control us through fear, or one where we can exercise our religion free of charge."</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided to get the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the nursery, we headed up with high pressure at the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, moved my shoes, went into the prayers, and what I saw, let me hold myself."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, and was welcomed to our guests, because half of the gathered were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, Atheisten, creditors and non-believers who were not to attack, but to join us."</seg>
<seg id="387">At this moment I am collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and sympathy panic and prejudice.</seg>

<seg id="409">"before air conditioner, in our social awareness, has built a autonomous fleet of aircraft in France live in France with a six meter high tower of 1 500 Ziegels. a few years ago, they began to fly with soap."</seg>

<seg id="411">You can also build self-confident structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">"they have learned to wear loads, to deal with turbulence and to react in general to nature laws."</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to cross the limits of the Possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"to make a system autonom works, it must know collective, where the mobile objects must be found."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at ETH Zürich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamical Tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos, we use a new localization technology from Verity studios, a publisher of our laboratories."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"each panel has internal sensors to determine the position in space, calculations on board, which should do the machine."</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands is available on the highest level. for example" "start" "and end". ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a sogendered rear-starter.</seg>
<seg id="422">"a plane, that tries to beat two flies with a flap."</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other starrons, it is efficient in the pre-heating flight efficiently, much more efficient than helicopter in all their variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"contrary to most starters, it can float, and thus it has advantages at home and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always an upside."</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of rear-starters is that they are sensitive to turbulences like wind bows.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">"the idea behind it is that the aircraft, no matter in which position the optimum position can be reachieved and improved the performance by naughty."</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions that penetrate at the heart of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be an example: what is the smaller number of movable parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopter are known about as machines with a thousand movable parts that convenes to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">"decades ago, pilots could fly-controlled flight devices that had only two movable parts: a propeller and a rear of rear."</seg>
<seg id="435">"long, we discovered that Flies with only one works."</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the monospinner, the mechanical-easiest remote-conditioner. it was recently invented."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only one movable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no clapping, hinges and cross-body, no further actuators or controlment-surfaces, only a propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanical simpy, happens in the interior living very much, so that it can fly stable and can move in space."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear-rigid. to bring it to the rocks, I have to throw it right correctly."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the probability to throw it right, if everyone is seeing, is low, that's why I indicate you a video that was filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"when the monospinner is a exercise in gendarty, this machine is here, the Omnipotter with his eight propellern, a exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this transition?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"thereby, he receives the most significant capacity,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"move in space in all directions, no matter in which direction it is filmed or even as he rotating."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight Propellern."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some is adjustable in models, the rest is learned directly at the flies."</seg>
<seg id="450">See what we see.</seg>
<seg id="451">"if flight machines are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine here consists of two separate two-propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns on clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when one build them together, they behave like a high-performance-Quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, goes wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a cordless -- can fly the machine if also restricted."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate that by half an airplane.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration studied synthetic conversion.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the number of autonomous, co-ordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We participated in common micro-Quadcopter -- every single weighs less than a washer bread -- and statutes it with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">"each unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no border."</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine da dring wants to become a flying lamp on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us lies the wages in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as memory, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures allowing them to form so spectacular way."</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such a massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>

AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicists at MIT. he has been studied Gravitational wears from black holes and their through observatories like LIGO measurable signals. what are Gravitational markers?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a cradle in the feet of space and time.</seg>

<seg id="497">"the problem is that Gravitational wellen extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on 14 September, for example, each of us was stretched out of the waves of the waves and the elongation of an average person was 10 high."</seg>
<seg id="499">"this means 20 nullen according to the comma, followed by a first time, one declared the LIGO staff for crazy."</seg>

<seg id="502">"described Kip Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, the hunt for the waves as follows:" the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are enormous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"but physicists are enlightened, and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">"back to LIGO. Scott claims, LIGO is more a ear than one eye."</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: facials, the size of your mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite handy. for so you can customize an image or a map of things by seeing the light of several points coming around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">For killing is the different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"therefore it is very difficult, actually impossible to make a picture of things which are particularly important to you:"</seg>

<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by considering changes in the amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least lie for LIGO the mastered frequencies in the audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">"when we shift wavpatterns in Schall, we can speak the universe literally."</seg>
<seg id="522">"the gravitation to listen, can tell us about a lot about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been very busy for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="523">"sh: two black, non-rotating holes, circulations simple: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">Turn the two body very fast you hear the same pattern with an additional sound change. that sounds like this: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>

<seg id="527">AA: superior to us what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the dense body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve hundreds of times per second before they colonize."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>

<seg id="532">Therein lies the permanent importance of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO has a completely new way to study the universe as they never had previously been possible.</seg>

<seg id="542">"and probably the most important thing: I am optimistic that we have never seen in all things we have never seen, and of which we do not have any idea. things we can only discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, the Light found in the first sight things we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this topic: ME: the kind of stars, the black holes, like LIGO they are observed, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>

<seg id="560">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">"no, no, no, but yes, yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: exactly what to do, wovor I feared, flamed my fear."</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fear, speeches to hold, my social fear -- puff, away."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">"but there was a particular Yes, which was deeply changed my life, on an unexpected art. it started with a question of my youngest."</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls for unexplained reasons all 'kittens,"</seg>
<seg id="570">As if they were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"kissing, I need milk for my beak."</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked me once I could play with her when I was on the leap. and I said: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"a new attitude in my family. from there to swear I always to play with them, as soon as you are doing so. no matter what I am doing, or where I go, I say yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"fast. I am not perfect, but I like me very much."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, to my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an intriguing side effect: only recently I understood that the 'yes' sentences to play with my children my career saved.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am author. I think of things you awake to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dreams.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dreams.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I produce producier television.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I make television, in great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">"in this TV season, I am responsible for bringing about 70 hours of program to the world."</seg>
<seg id="587">"four television programs, 70 hours television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">"each program provides hundreds of jobs, which is not existed before."</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV channel can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode all nine days and four shows, so all nine days 20 million dollars television, four TV programs, three hours TV, three Shows, three episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my television spies run on Thursday morning.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world are running my series in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators.</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts which I have created themselves and not only produced, so yet obendly. I must find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans around campfire and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four television programs, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bearing fire care around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is this still doing?</seg>
<seg id="598">"nobody, therefore I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dreams.</seg>
<seg id="600">I would not want to impress you with this.</seg>
<seg id="601">"I say it, because I know what you think when the word" author "falls."</seg>
<seg id="602">"I tell you that all of you who work so hard if you're talking to a company, a country or a household, take seriously if I am talking about work, so you understand that I don't just talk on the computer that I am saying, I understand that it goes with a dreamjob for dreams."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it is all a job, all work, all the reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I'm working a lot, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I am deepened in the work, there is no other sense."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is, when I put troops up, when mold I am on a canvas."</seg>
<seg id="608">"as a dreamy, you have a high sound, liven a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">One feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"she is creative, mechanical, strenuous, and intoxicating, clinically and maternal, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonably. and the best thing is the sums."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when working well runs.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a swings starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the sums stops like a busy road, I could always go on her."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people are taking, when I'm talking to them the swelling that I talk to writing, that writing me joy."</seg>
<seg id="616">Do not understand myself wrong they do.</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the sums -- when I started working with television production when I began to work and work, to create and work together, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy. the swams!"</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than the writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a threat.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums of God is voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a sums, then you cannot count differently from the size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"the feeling of being no different from being able to strive as to the size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I do not know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I know only that I am not afraid, and I just know that I love the summen."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I just want to say to you, I am a Titan, and I know that I do not want it to ask."</seg>
<seg id="632">"to make a clear one: the more I'll ever more broadcasts, the more sneakers, the more work there, the more things the more, the more I write history, the more expectations are there."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work, to be successful, the more you have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love job, do not come true?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the land, which I carafe, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high tone, the sums, the sums, the sums."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the swelling.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then stops the sums.</seg>
<seg id="641">"revised, overweight, exaggerated, burned down."</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stops.</seg>
<seg id="643">"now, my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mum is a single labour market."</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" my mom will not be there, but you can write my Nanny. "</seg>
<seg id="645">"Emerson says:" "kissing, I want to go to Shonda Land."</seg>
<seg id="646">There are the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are Baby-Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1, when the sums stopped."</seg>
<seg id="649">The swelling of the motor petrified.</seg>
<seg id="650">I did not love my job anymore. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My swelling was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I made the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-day, no repent, nothing delegates, a Titan sleeps, do not exist, with full heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four television programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four television programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a show-Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was gray, I simply had no fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the swelling and the sums I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what makes you do, when what you do, the work you love, suddenly faded?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know, some may think:" "Heule thee," "the author-Titan." ""</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know, you do it, you work, you are doing what you're doing is a teacher to be a teacher, a mother, Bill Gates, and knows how to stop the swinger, when the swams stops, who is the sums up, who is one then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"if the song of my heart hears, I can survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then put me my "southern states-Kellnerin" a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way out there, late dran and she says:" Mama, magst you playing? "</seg>
<seg id="673">"and I already want to say No, when I will be aware of two things:"</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I must say yes to everything and secondly, they called me not" "kittens." ""</seg>
<seg id="675">"it does not call anyone" "kittens." ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I promise it when I am Titan am and my swams, and here everything changes from my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says:" "Mama," you play? "</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">It is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we are playing and their sisters encounter, we laugh a lot and I read completely dramatically from the book" Everybody Poops. ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in loneliness and the lack of sums, I cannot do anything except."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focussed.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quietly.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the land I carafe, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high tone - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"everything that exists are glued finger and moisture kisses, delicate voices, wax-pins and the song that goes to Losses, or whatever the girl in" The Eiskin "." "</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so close that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I am.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me is redeemed.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energy cirub comes.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that is not immediately, but it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums comes back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it is quiet, hardly anything else, but it is there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the sums, but a sums."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I would know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let us stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. this is all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums, the working environment, the fixings, that is only the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, when I am talking about shipments and television hours and how functional my brain is, then I forget what the real swams is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is not strength and it is not a job-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent on joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">True sums is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums is the power that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">True sums is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"true sums ignores the pressure of the story, which will be done to dify tasks, expectation and pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">True sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"true sums of God is voice in my ear, but maybe whispered God the wrong words, for which God said to me that I am a Titan Poker?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is simply love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a bit more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"once my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a rule that I can free myself as a workaholic of any fault.</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice if I want to hear the summen again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so easy. I am not good in playing, I like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">"I do not play a clue as well, as working."</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth does hurt;</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">"I'm working, because I love it."</seg>
<seg id="725">I am better at work as a home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"it's painful, because what a man is working rather than to be home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"yes, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" Titan "--"</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am to relaxed is none of it.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we shave in the garden around, before and back, and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">We do small dance parties;</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We are bursting ropes.</seg>
<seg id="735">"in doing so I feel mainly stiff, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always teaches to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the sums of the universe met me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I wonder: why have we ever heard with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! tell them always Yes when your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">"maybe you hold me for naïve, for a diver."</seg>
<seg id="742">There you are quite right but you can also do it!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And you also know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my little ones want to play a maximum of 15 minutes to me, until they agree that they want to do something else."</seg>
<seg id="748">"there are wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes me will be replaced by Marienkäfer or Keks.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and speak my teeny daughter whole 15 minutes long with me, I am mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"there are only 15 minutes, more it does not require."</seg>
<seg id="752">"each one can bring 15 minutes a piece, even at a tractor-Laune-day!"</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no cell, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the children are ready."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my well-being, my world. there must not be the children. it is to feel the swams to have a place for his soul's soul."</seg>
<seg id="758">It is not about playing with your own children. it is about joy</seg>
<seg id="759">Around the "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do good.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find it out and keep it out.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I am not perfect in it. I fail and I victories. friends meet, books read, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"want to play?" stands shortly for everything I got up, when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training when I wanted to meet myself more and more. "</seg>
<seg id="765">"15 minutes in the piece, why not full 15 minutes of skill?"</seg>
<seg id="766">What can it be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my spare time. the sums seems to return when I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Works not without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opens up the door, and I find myself in my office. I hear a unknown melody, they met me and my soul. I love me to new ideas. I use it in full breeding and love my work again."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the swams, but I do not love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I do not need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the swelling that sums is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap, and adhesive finger, dinner with friends."</seg>
<seg id="774">This is now my swelling.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the sums of work is part of me, but just a part. and for this I am so grateful."</seg>
<seg id="778">"it is sorry to me that I am a Titan. I have never seen a Titan, the trip to Jerusalem."</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and to more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functional. my campfire still burn.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the happier I and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as a good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the clearer my head."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the swelling. the land I shades, the marathon, the marathon, the screen, the sums, the sums, the sums, the other, the sums of life."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this swelling, the more this unusual, scend, naked and new life-feeling in me wide. less Titan -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel exactly this sums, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">I am author. I think of things I awake you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">"this belongs to the job, which means to live its dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"that is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dreamjob should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" to less work and to more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titles have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues every day I have to do with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a heavy stroke or a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other bodily organs, has a very low capacity to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a severe violation of the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, heavy disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I have functional neurosurgical surgical procedure.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor that tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"surely they have heard of one of the most known ones, the" deep underground stimulation. "thereby, one implements one electrode deeply in the brain in order to influence the circuits of the neurons so that neurological function can be improved."</seg>
<seg id="805">"it really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson, which suffered severe tremors and heavy pain."</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation however does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream functional neurosurgeon is the recovery of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was leading nursing and worked during the emergency day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I awed patients with skull-deer trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They must imagine that at skull-Hirn-traumata the brain dominates and the skull-pressure push.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life you have to diminish the skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">"to do this, you sometimes have to remove a part of cotton brain."</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of creating the cured priests, we decided to analyze with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"to let cells have grown from a tissue type, comparable with very small children that will be taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find the right diet, temperature, moisture and the environments to maintain them."</seg>
<seg id="823">This is precisely what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many trainees it made Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">This was what he saw under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with great green cells that are surrounded by small, unmature cells. "</seg>
<seg id="829">"maybe you still know from the Biology lessons, that stem cells unripe cells are, which can turn into each cell type of the organism."</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cell cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprisingly to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain cells in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells have been different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They shared slowly and after a couple of weeks they died even.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, weird cell population, who saw how stem cells saw, but was different."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand how he came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells hot Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">You make 4% of our grandpristine cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">"at the stage of the fetus, they ensure the folding of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="844">But why stay they received?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we can find them in higher concentrations."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not that safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">"we stand in front of a potential cell source, the brain healing."</seg>
<seg id="850">This we had to prove.</seg>
<seg id="851">"so, we decided to develop an experiment."</seg>
<seg id="852">"we wanted to take a piece of brain from the non-linguistic field, and then the cells will be as cultivate as Jean-François."</seg>
<seg id="853">And they were then colourful to cut them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we reimpled it to the drainage of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist Transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">"one of our first questions was: what happens when we do these cells in normal brain tissue, and what will happen if we do the same cells in damaged brave tissues?"</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we could work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we traveled the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that they were completely disappeared after a few weeks, they were taken back home. the space is already occupied, they will not disappear there, so they will not disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">"in the second scenario, we put an injury to and reimpled exactly the same cells and now remained the cells -- they washed up to mature neurons."</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been reimpled.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the proof that they show are these small points. these are the cells that we are in vitro, in culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">"here, we could not stop."</seg>
<seg id="864">"help these cells also a monkey, to recover from a brain injury?"</seg>
<seg id="865">"so, we are trained monkeys with a manual skill."</seg>
<seg id="866">You had to take feed feed from one tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they had achieved a stable skill level, we last in the motoric Cortex the Handmotoric section."</seg>
<seg id="869">"then, the monkeys were paralysed, they could no longer move her hand anymore."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen to people, they rejuvenate spontaneously up to a certain degree, just as after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"patients are paralyzed, and then try to recover with the help of plastic brains mechanisms. they rest at some degree, just like the monkey."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, implanted, we implanted his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">"on the left you see the monkey, which is spontaneous."</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original power in front of injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not as precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now, see when we have the cells reimpled: the same reefs, two months after the irritation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">"since that time, we have found a lot more about these cells."</seg>
<seg id="879">We can use them freeze and later use.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use them in other neuropathological models, for example at Parkinson."</seg>
<seg id="881">"but our dream is still, it is still to implanted by the people."</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal themselves.</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I am sure now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" I know someone who need it. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on the human being."</seg>
<seg id="887">"Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, one has to fill about two kilograms papers and forms to run this kind of studies."</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical studies. if you continue to look into the future as many years it takes, until someone can get into hospital and that therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: this is hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the authorisation of the clinical study."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it takes a long time to select the patient, to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply this to a multi-centric study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You have to really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment.</seg>
<seg id="898">"BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: natural."</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">"we in the West make a big mistake, it as of course to consider."</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that is in reality, but as the inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as unchanging opponents.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism is inevitably led to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and its great dessert in Beijing have doubted that it is quite possible to have a blooming capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, the democracy comes with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unambiguous that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- does not have the austerity measures expected in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"in this moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party, or some of my expenses could be repeated that democracy would be abolished when they would alter anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">"at this point, I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you, together with me, again to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup, we could save the democracy, but that we need a true and defective democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"for without democracy, our societies become painted, our future gloomy and our great, new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the topic of waste, I would like to point out about an interesting contradiction, which is currently threatening our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twins summit-paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"a summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the Schuldenberg, who throws its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"all of us recognize the Schuldenberg,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize its twilling.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which belongs to observing austerity and corporations that could be too anxious to invest where it would be productive and incomes with which one could urgently needed the debt recovery and also all the things that mankind could urgently need for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"over the past 3 months in the United States, in England and in the eurozone, 3.4 trillion expected goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, gliding, equipment and so on and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3.4 trillion US dollars sounds like a lot of money, until one compares with the 5,1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time have been around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing else except the flanges and the real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus, debts and unproductive capital form the forced summit, which is not the same by the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result are stagnating wages, more than one quarter of 25-54-year-old in the United States, Japan and Europe, and consequently, a low total economic demand, which would affect them in which they do not invest in which they would not kill him if he will grow,"</seg>
<seg id="925">"thanked the circumstances lead, which lead to that eco-pus travills him."</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hairy with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"its extremely connectedness. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, improving human talents, and particularly all of the technologies to finance," green "technologies that are crucial to save the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we are going on. but before we continue: what do we mean in democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the social form in which the open and poor to control the poor as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The athic democracy closed naturally too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to diminish the significance of the athic democracy due to these degrees."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decision of the athic democracy was and is that she gave the working poor, not only the right to freedom of expression, but is more important and crucial that they have the right to political co-determination with equal voting in issues of the state."</seg>
<seg id="935">The athic democracy has not been held for a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, which is very bright, it is also quickly burned."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our present liberal democracies have not their roots in the ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"whereas the athic democracy focused on free citizens, and the working poor stronger, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which was ultimately a statute for the ruling class."</seg>
<seg id="940">"for the liberal democracy came only to, as a complete separation of politics and economy, and the democratic process of politics became apparent during the economy -- so the world of the concert -- was a democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our current democracies there since the time, in which this separation of politics and economy began to take an unprecedented struggle between the two by taking the economy gradually deteriorated them."</seg>
<seg id="942">Wonders why the politicians are no longer like they used to be?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not about a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because one cannot be in the government today, and yet in power, because the power of politics in the economy is abandered and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hairy with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is about just like a flock of robber that sustaining so sustainable the animals, of which they nourished, that it is therefore starvation in the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"it is similar to the economy, which outlines the policy so far as cannibals. the power of corporations are growing, political goods are increasing, the overall economic demand falls and the managing director of the corporations are too cold, the bargain of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the successful of capitalism the" Demos "[the people] sells out of democracy, the higher the twist summit, and all the greater the waste of human labour power and prosperity of humankind."</seg>
<seg id="949">"it's true that we need to bring together politics and the economy, and it would be better when doing the" Demos "control, as in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, the women and the foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go well.</seg>
<seg id="952">"the teaching from the Debakel of the Soviet Union should be, that the working poor is to reproduce a position as in the ancient Athens without new species of brutality and waste."</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism is doing it by using Niedriglhnable by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is to be higher, so long economy and politics are separate, the automation can be higher and the social conflicts deeper, as it is -- as soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we have to renew the economy and reunite the areas of business and politics, and considering that we have the reunited area of more democratic, otherwise we end up in a unified surveillance hyperautocracy, which can appear as a documentary" matrix "such as documentation."</seg>
<seg id="957">"so the question is not, whether capitalism has brought the technical achievements that he has brought, survive --"</seg>
<seg id="958">"the most interesting question is whether capitalism is dissolved by a Dylanie, similar to the" matrix, "in the machines to serve the people and people put their energy into the study of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athos" Agora, "in long talks with the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I believe we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"so what could it look, how could it look to have these" Star Trek "like utopia instead of the" matrix "-similar Dylanie?"</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples in all soon."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the field of companies: ask for a capital market, in which you're worthy of money while you work and in which your capital follows you from a job site, from a company to the next, and the company -- regardless of which you just work -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital and redeem and the concept of wage labor is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the companies, but they do not work in it, and employees who are working there. no exchange between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and spars, and ultimately not an emporous twins."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy, please note that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of the whole of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"imagine that the entire world trade trading in this currency will be traded -- let's call them" the cosmos "," in units of "Kosmos" "-- and every government pays the sum, which corresponds to the deficit or the trade agreement of the respective country, into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"also imagine that this fund is investing in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world, in which investment."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes was suggested in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time not the technical means had to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have them, especially in the background of a united policy and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world I describe, is at the same time being liberated, in which she preferred to privileged people, and Marxist, because they buried the separation of capital and labour in the invalid of history, and keynesian, global keynesian."</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all others it is a world where we can imagine real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We are awakening in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we move into a "matrix" - similar Dylany?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">"it is in our hands, and we do it better democratic."</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography itself as a liberary Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I have just said, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for reunification of politics and economy is... do we do not realize the technological development a massive decline in the overall economic demand, what Larry summers as" long-term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"by transferring this crisis from a part of the earth to the next, as we experience it, not only our democracies is destabilising, but also the countries, whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is correct, Marx is quite relevant."</seg>
<seg id="986">"as Hayek, therefore I am a libertary Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I am also completely wires."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: actually, and now we are probably too."</seg>
<seg id="988">"YV: if you do not agree, you do not think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein, who said that. BG: in your talk, Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of speakers have you very clearly stated what you think about the sight of the West in China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the voucher of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy toward politics during the area where most of the economy is playing, -- the area of economy -- a completely democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in a certain point, if I may say so provocative, China today resembles the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"because -- do you remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- this is an error, historically considered."</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, how John Stuart Mill -- "</seg>
<seg id="997">"he was particularly skeptical, which concerns the democratic development."</seg>
<seg id="998">"what you can now watch in China, resembles very the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"China now have to confess that, what the West has done in the 19th century, smelling abounded to hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as a financial minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I suppose that it comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later to the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from personal vision, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to take a new beginning with the Eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely, to administered us from the self-sufficiency and the continuous denial is that a massive displacement line was passed through the Eurozone and continues to be massively threatened with the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, based on Greek demonstrations -- the way, the first proposal was that this denial is obvious --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately, the powers within the euro zone, within the European group, continue to denial the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if one is trying to get an economic system that is not far-viable, through political will and authoritism in life it will perhaps be able to delay a while, but when change occurs, it happens abrupt and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change do you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">"YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future, if we do not change its construction."</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: do you have made any mistakes in your time as a finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- seriousness...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a finance minister, or any Minister, who claims after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, he claimed no mistakes, then it is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">"of course, I made mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest mistake was to sign the request for the extension of the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honorary interest in the pages of the donors to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">"they just wanted to bring our government only because they did not want to deal with the shipments, who lose through the eurozone."</seg>

<seg id="1038">"from Roy Price, most never heard, although it is probably responsible for 22 medium-moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">"probably for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for a lot of you."</seg>
<seg id="1040">This is going back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is introductory primorter at Amazon Studios;</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has a longterm and describes itself on Twitter as" movies, TV, technology, Tacos. "</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because it is responsible for which shows the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard-fight industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy can not choose any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he has to find shows, which are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he must find shows that are quite right on this turn."</seg>
<seg id="1049">"this curve is the assessment of over 2500 TV series on the IMDb website. the review dates from 1 to 10, and the height shows how many shows this review received."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"your show will be valued at nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" Breaking Bad "," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows, the addictive, where you ask a season, your brain asks: "where is there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left hand side, here at this end, shows how" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- -- this should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not take effect on the left side of the curve because I think one needs special intelligence to provide "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts about the average balance, the average television -- the shows that neither good nor poorly, they just do not inspire."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is present, and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing something, that is why Roy Price is going to risk nothing."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses with eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online where they can watch everyone for free."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon is going out there, it is still going to be right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers will look at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they will be observed when watching these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team to record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you capture, when you start the show when you break down, which parts you may skip, or look at once again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">"they collect millions of data to decide using this data, which show they should produce."</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact they collect the data, process these and resulting from the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a Sitcom on four Republican US senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that many people remember this show because she was not so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is only an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this turn 7,4 amounts and Alpha House landet at 7,5 -- so something above average, but not exactly what we worked on Roy and his team."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"about at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top-show by data analysis. its name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of netflix. just like Roy he is always looking for to find this a super show and he does it also use data for it, but it makes things different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of holding a competition, he and his team gave their existing data on the Netflix audience, so the reviews that they give the shows, their course, which shows them etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then use these data to find these little details about the audience: what shows they like what producers which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had together all the parts, they entered a wagon and decided not to make a Sitcom on four senators, but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards ". Netflix has managed to hit a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">House of Cards "gets a 9,1 review on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competitive, data sealed. "</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect to this many data and it works great for one of them but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic is somehow dominating that this should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collects millions of data, for a decision that you meet, then you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">We optimised it by very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"what you can expect, is good television, or?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis is not working so, then this is a little scary because we are living in a time when we take more and more to statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does someone know here the company multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's even good. "</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one can ever get in this room with this software. come in touch with that you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in prison in prison and to dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if an discharge is done or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad, a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate television, 22 minutes, this can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">"not always created the best results. this is not always that a company like multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data."</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data sealed companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"2009 announced Google to know that by data analysis breaks out of flu, the limb way, predictions, -- by data analysis of the Google's research."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderful and was a great news item. the success gifted in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked impeccable, year around year after year until there was suddenly no more working,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply does not work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data is sealed companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all these errors flows in decisions of life a -- on the workplace, in the legal framework, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">"so, we should rather make sure that data are helpful."</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-used genetics -- an area where some very smart people unimaginable lots of data to make serious decisions, as the decision for a cancer therapy"</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medicine. over the years I have recognised some patterns over the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"you need to solve a complex problem, do not do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"as a First, you set up this problem in its parts, so you can analyze the spare parts; as a second set you put the items again to put a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you need to do this several times, but there are always two things: apart and put together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help create a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to reenforce the parts and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">"for this, there is another tool and we all possess all of our brain."</seg>
<seg id="1117">"when there is something that is good when the brain is good, it is parts and pieces back again, even if the information is incomplete, so if the information is incomplete, especially when it is the brain of a expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore I think it was Netflix so successful because they have data and mind, where they are also executed in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience, for what else would not have been capable of. but the decision, how to put all of these parts, and make it a show like" House of Cards "," that did not stand in the data. "</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show which meant that they entered a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">"on the other hand, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way."</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they use data to control all their decisions, first as they have a TV ideas, then as they chose" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they could always say: "they say to us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe that things go wrong when data start to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are only a tool and not to forget that this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball. it is amazing. for decisions using a ja- or no question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer." most likely "-- exactly here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will see it later with an Technikdemo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">I have so far made some decisions in my life so I should have heard in the ball on the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you of course know if you have the data available, you would like to replace that by something much unused, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic building.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"so perhaps the ball klüger and klüger, and lush. ultimately, it is possible to make decisions when we want to reach something special at the end of the right corner."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the great amount of data always pays to make decisions, an expert in what you do, and to address the risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"in the end, it is not the data but the risks with which you end up at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks.</seg>
