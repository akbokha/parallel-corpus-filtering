Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that change your view to the city
&quot; Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt , where young people will face young people today . &quot;
a tom@@ atoes place where now for S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small nur@@ series refers to the most influ@@ ential reason of farmers .
the oldest official map of Mün@@ ch encourages exciting stories to days .
it is nervous when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
&quot; that knows everyone who had to be exciting already , because the car @-@ Nav@@ i instead of a revers@@ al street showed a green me@@ adow . &quot;
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bayern At@@ las@@ es , an offer of Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the State Government , are anything but up to date - but that is why we are very enlight@@ ening . &quot;
especially when one compar@@ es them with current online maps .
&quot; then , the cities and municipalities in the spread @-@ area of the Mün@@ ch@@ ner Merk@@ ur have changed since the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a Flick@@ ent@@ epp@@ ich , which can be seen as such as such . &quot;
&quot; in the great over@@ pic@@ .@@ postcard were used for cities and communities for more detailed maps , so @-@ called Ur@@ posi@@ tions@@ blades . &quot;
this emerged according to the data of the Bav@@ arian Constitu@@ tional Management between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and jump to the first reference point of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader of Bavaria since the spring 1800 during the Second Ko@@ ali@@ tion@@ aries of Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave an top@@ ographic inclusion of Bavaria to order - naturally for military purposes .
&quot; even if the French troops went out with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from 9 February 18@@ 01 : there were today &apos;s neighbours , which created the idea of a remote Bavaria map . &quot;
&quot; for Max I@@ V. Joseph , the project is moving forward , founded the &quot; top@@ ographical Bureau &quot; &quot; and thus the Bayer@@ ische Constitu@@ tional administration . &quot;
the Ur@@ posi@@ tions@@ blatt for Munich comes from the year 18@@ 56 and is like to find all others on the website of the Bayer@@ ische Landes@@ bibliothek .
&quot; the comparison of early / Today , the example of the state capital is the most impressive . &quot;
the city has spread over all directions and has grown together .
&quot; one example of this is under@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which is still relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 . &quot;
&quot; ship@@ ling was built 21 years after the creation of the map , so 1877 , as the Mün@@ ch@@ ner district . &quot;
&quot; today , underground d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses under@@ took place in 18@@ 56 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ strasse , which was only named after 1878 of Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er , a leader of the insur@@ rection of the Bav@@ arian peasants against Austria 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West@@ park is , there is nothing but fields - at first glance : when Hin@@ om@@ o@@ omen appears a smaller card with do@@ z@@ ens lines and numbers : hand@@ writing number@@ ed pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; ur@@ ay &quot; &quot; which was derived from the primary tax . &quot;
small plots there today no farmers had no more - but small ten@@ derness of the plant &quot; Land in the sun . &quot;
a large green surface is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
&quot; Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wiese , since 18@@ 10 Schau@@ platz of the October , was in the 19th century a me@@ adow - and no concrete desert . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot;
in the Ur@@ posi@@ tions@@ blatt in the territory of today &apos;s Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen not only reads the road names &quot; at Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; or from the height &quot; On the Past &quot; - but also in big letter &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ str . once , people were invited to people with mad@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; there was 18@@ 58 / 59 the Mün@@ ch@@ ner district @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anst@@ alt &quot; &quot; On the Au@@ er &apos;s ventilation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; since 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard from G@@ ud@@ der led the establishment - that psych@@ i@@ atri@@ sts , which is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig@@ s . &quot;
&quot; he was advanced for his time , and ended up for example the do@@ ck of so called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he allowed the staff to use violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen who has engaged in an exhibition with the An@@ st@@ alt . &quot;
&quot; first place for 280 patients was first place , later on 500 places was enlarged . &quot;
some@@ time this capacity will no longer be seen - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ anst@@ alt in hair 1905 .
&quot; there since 2006 the Is@@ ar @-@ AM@@ PER @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um München @-@ East , one of the biggest psych@@ i@@ atri@@ en Germany . &quot;
&quot; on the A@@ real , the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt meet young people in the Mün@@ ch@@ ner Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um . &quot;
the Order &apos;s war@@ b built in 1920 and turned him to a youth @-@ heim with training .
&quot; located west is the football field of the TS@@ V Munich east , eastern residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , one set up the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; - in architectural attraction for the origins of the Ir@@ ren@@ anst@@ alt , which was destroyed during the Second World War . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was characterized by 18@@ 56 as &quot; main square &quot; , &quot; the Mer@@ ing@@ erst@@ raße name was called &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War in the heart of the Mün@@ ch .
the bom@@ bs of the Al@@ lies ris@@ sen in December 1944 many holes in the city center .
a great stayed until today - at Mari@@ enhof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business buildings and a fruit chapel from the Middle Ages was once on Mari@@ enhof , where these days were the pre @-@ work and take place on 5 April 2017 of late @-@ track record for the second S @-@ Bahn track . &quot;
&quot; with the sli@@ der , the old Munich @-@ card can compare with the air @-@ image of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof . &quot;
&quot; civil rights group released , travel , for Miss@@ our@@ i &quot;
the Nation@@ ale Association for the promotion of colour@@ ful people exhibited a warning for colour@@ ful people who travel due to dis@@ crimin@@ atory policy and r@@ acial attacks of the state according to Miss@@ our@@ i .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Ad@@ visory for the Federal State of Miss@@ our@@ i , which should arise until 28 August 2017 , visitors and ab@@ our@@ ian@@ ans , as a number of frag@@ ile , r@@ acial @-@ based inci@@ dents in recent times occur and here mer@@ ged , &quot; says it in the opinion of the group . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law of Miss@@ our@@ i that makes it more difficult to gain dis@@ crimin@@ ating dis@@ crimin@@ ations , as well as the criminal enforcement authorities of the State , the dis@@ proportion@@ ate on minorities , illustr@@ ate the group , the travel warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
they have violations of citizens &apos; rights to happen .
&quot; they are hal@@ ted because of their skin colour , they are be@@ aten or killed , &quot; said the President of Miss@@ our@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Ch@@ apel , the K@@ ansas City Star . &quot;
we hear symptoms in such an incidence that we have not yet heard .
it is the first such warning that which has issued the organisation for a state in the US .
&quot; the sec@@ rec@@ y inci@@ dents like rac@@ ist exp@@ o against black students at the University of Miss@@ our@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ enn@@ es@@ see . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died in frag@@ ile circumstances at the beginning of the year , after having no longer had a gas@@ oline by the state by the state and was taken by the police of Miss@@ our@@ i in prison , without a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also shows a recent report by the office of the general state @-@ owned by Miss@@ our@@ i , in which black drivers in the state will be raised 75 percent more common than past@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and their families , friends and staff know about what could happen in Miss@@ our@@ i , &quot; said Ch@@ apel . &quot;
people need to be ready to bring it to deposit or let them know that they travel through the state .
&quot; Miss@@ our@@ i reported in 2015 100 H@@ ass@@ ette break , according to the latest figures from the H@@ ass@@ ban reporting Programme of F@@ BI , which entered the state with regard to the number of such inj@@ uries on the 16th ranking of the country . &quot;
&quot; the warning is also an answer to a new mis@@ our@@ i law , which would make it harder to beh@@ ave a company because of residential or employment discrimination . &quot;
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union had published by the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ LU ) Dest@@ inations for Texas and Arizona , after the United States immigration authorities , who commit local criminal law enforcement authorities , which will contribute to further rac@@ use rules , according to view of the AC@@ LU to further r@@ acial profil@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; travel war@@ nings are usually issued by the Foreign Ministry for other countries , but at the last time , stakeholders have used to act as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
sub@@ sub@@ project is element@@ ary
the Fisch@@ erb@@ acher Wei@@ dez@@ au@@ n project is a success project and continued next year .
the CD@@ U bund@@ le Peter White and Kor@@ dul@@ a K@@ ov@@ ac have created a picture on site .
at the rect@@ ang@@ enhof of the family Schwen@@ de@@ mann met representatives of the Fisch@@ erb@@ acher CD@@ U locality together with Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs .
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann gave him insight into his farm , in which he has 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest be@@ for@@ et , 40 milk @-@ rich and also houses many young animals and houses in five apartments holiday houses . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; black @-@ t@@ milk &quot; &quot; is for him the aging mark@@ eter path for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; at the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ o , only region@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; as it is also BL@@ H@@ V @-@ Chairman of fis@@ bach , he describes the sub@@ sub@@ project as &quot; element@@ ary &quot; . &quot; &quot;
I can not manage such a rigi@@ d areas not profitable .
the founding area care for a lot of work , much m@@ ts with the engine sense are edited . &quot;
&quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the counter @-@ operation and operated with these without chemical plant protection and fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ ers , even if he does not lead the lead . &quot;
&quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognised the meaning of the ordination project , and is glad to promote the leader . &quot;
&quot; at the expense of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , the farmers would have to be supported . &quot;
we hope that the for@@ estation of the areas could be extended for quite a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure that we have , are the people who work in agriculture and make their thoughts on how they continue to continue their operations , &quot; stressed the may@@ or . &quot;
farmers are often in criticism due to support
more than 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 .
&quot; for 40 hectares , the open area is 40 hectares , which may not be re@@ for@@ ested by at least 2023 . &quot;
&quot; the total cost of EUR 71 500 euros was funded by the total cost , a quarter carried out the municipality of fisher@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus , the farmers had to invest 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16,@@ 2 kilometres . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; stated Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; Kor@@ dul@@ a K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; you make a really good job , without farmers and land@@ lady it does not go . &quot;
also for Peter Weiss stand firm : &quot; here are best food produced . &quot;
the landsc@@ ap@@ ing line ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state promotion of femin@@ ist fence .
the goal is to ensure the growth of the black .
prerequis@@ ite is the presence of one of the L@@ PR signed .
&quot; in addition , the en@@ closed surface must not be des@@ per@@ missible ( Hang@@ ing over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by for@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; for the fisher@@ man &apos;s ordination project , 2018 is currently running the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build nearly 16 kilometres of Zau@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the common area is equivalent to 35 hectares , the cal@@ orie costs lie at more than 112 000 Euros . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp takes the Statue of Liberty
&quot; the saf@@ est sign of a regime change , it is when they begin to att@@ acking the stat@@ ues . &quot;
&quot; Americans appreciate this as much as any other - therefore , the car@@ ving overthrow Sadd@@ am H@@ uss@@ one on the Fir@@ dos Square in Bag@@ hd@@ ad in 2003 . &quot;
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key @-@ ide@@ ologists of the Tru@@ mp regime , knew certainly what he did , when he took a symbo@@ lic A@@ xt in a h@@ sl@@ ed argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N on the proposals of the president of the dr@@ astic limitation of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to stay fair , Miller took not the statue itself . &quot;
&quot; a hor@@ de of boot@@ s@@ poss@@ essing and Liberty im@@ it@@ ators should have suffered him , if he had done it . &quot;
&quot; but he laid their meaning , and especially the meaning that it was written , when the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , its base was added . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta , I want to go here not to a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom , which illumin@@ ated the world . &quot;
the poem which you relate to which later was added later and not part of the original statue of Liberty .
&quot; Miller is always right , but as he form@@ ulated it himself , it is not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary reson@@ ance on the emerging words of Laz@@ arus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the anger of the poor : &quot; thy ef@@ ills , your arms , and your fri@@ ght@@ ered masses , which will swing clear@@ er , free to breathe and eat the waste of your rich co@@ asts . &quot;
there was never a time when the &apos; el@@ der waste &apos; was better to see on our scre@@ ens .
Miller committed himself to liter@@ ary criticism - he clearly made that these people are not welcome in Tru@@ mp@@ s USA .
this conflict due to the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate : it is indeed a conflict for the importance of America .
Laz@@ arus - and her friends who set up their words according to their death on the base - did very well that they have a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by presented in an un@@ used classical display of the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom .
Laz@@ arus changed this meaning : in her poem the feminine figure is no longer abstract , she has received one voice . &quot;
and she himself gives himself a completely different name : mother of the Ex@@ il@@ ants .
the connection of the contract with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist Cou@@ p and a devast@@ ating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vism .
&quot; and just like Laz@@ arus the meaning of the statue changed , the people wanted to switch from the right wing this for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the big Schrei@@ er than Rus@@ h Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John of the Bu@@ yer for the Com@@ men of Tru@@ mp , arg@@ um@@ ented in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty had no one dra@@ wer , but rather an early Ne@@ o@@ on@@ cology , the American Fl@@ ame in the um@@ ented world : &quot; Lady Liberty is proce@@ eding . &quot;
it is supposed to carry the bas@@ el of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the bas@@ el is not supposed to shine the way into the United States . &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on something coated .
the meaning of the statue is quite and even a matter of view of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Laz@@ arus consi@@ sted of Laz@@ arus was to see how they were seen by the exhausted , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible trips to the Dec@@ ks of ships . &quot;
&quot; it is in the true sense to see the world from the perspective of people , to seek refu@@ ge and improve a chance of improving their lives . &quot;
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and will they have to hear .
&quot; of course , this is not the perspective that Miller and Tru@@ mp would ever want to recognize . &quot;
&quot; your bas@@ el is not meant to enlight@@ en the path , but the hate , who is their only source of power , infl@@ amed . &quot;
world championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black lo@@ bt Scottish members of the team of Great Britain
E@@ ili@@ dh Do@@ yle reminds of a time when only two vill@@ i belong@@ ed to the team of Great Britain
&quot; the work@@ manship of the Athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ headed sch@@ ot@@ tic contro@@ vers@@ y is a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record of Scottish Ath@@ l@@ eten was selected for London 2017 that starts on Friday .
&quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; in Scotland something special &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand and we will continue , until we find it out , &quot; said Black . &quot;
I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they did .
the Scottish Ath@@ l@@ eten think that it has something to do with what they did .
British Athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they did .
and also with the guy on the road@@ side .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish Ath@@ l@@ eten are medals of medals , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track , while E@@ ili@@ dh Do@@ yle was elected by the team to the team of team . &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ ie is quite mod@@ est .
your chapters speech was incredible . &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were sh@@ ot@@ y or wherever they live or train , went out of space and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the real feeling that em@@ ili@@ ie came naturally , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Common@@ wealth of Silver med@@ alli@@ ons , who will compete with the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les for the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 sh@@ ields in the British crew . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s best total at Ath@@ l@@ eten at the World Championship was seven who were 1983 and 2015 .
the middle @-@ range Mu@@ ir results in this way and has positioned five British and two European records last year .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,@@ 500 m and the 5,000 m . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,@@ 500 m , is another shame , which one should be observed after a great season , which was made victory in the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle reminds himself of their first World Championships than the only other Sch@@ otte in the team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
&quot; the cre@@ atic chapters says that they are &quot; enormous pro@@ ud@@ ly &quot; to the fact that many of its govern@@ ors do not only belong to the team , but in some cases , also in the medals and in the fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the speci@@ ality of this team member states that it was elected by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honour , but to know that my team mates voted for me and have chosen to something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the vill@@ i , who belong to the team . &quot;
it only shows how far we came .
&quot; and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to rise on po@@ dium . &quot;
what my speech should be concerned as a captain ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
&quot; I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , as we have a home world championship . &quot;
&quot; so it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from it , that we are back at the Olympi@@ ast@@ adi@@ on . &quot;
&quot; I am coming a second chance to go there and compete , and it will simply be as a great atmosphere out there . &quot;
blo@@ cking by critics about Facebook : Be@@ wir@@ b not for a public office if you cannot toler@@ ate the entry of voters
the Father of our country knew something of bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not last long until the newspapers may sm@@ ote him because of the interior policy as far as to its political principles . &quot;
he sh@@ red@@ ded with criticism , safe . &quot;
but he does not have brought his critics to silence .
&quot; for in 17@@ 83 , Washington : &quot; &quot; the freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stup@@ id and m@@ ute we will be guided as the sheep . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Govern@@ or Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an who must work on it , more like Washington . &quot;
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union def@@ ends it from the beginning of this week .
&quot; the st@@ aging of the govern@@ or sent the law@@ suit than fri@@ vo@@ l , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a guy like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a Republi@@ can govern@@ or in a overwhelming democratic state that is amazing .
he has the two @-@ ray consent of the 50 govern@@ or of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary heat .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to principles .
&quot; he was also very sent to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to turn his ha@@ ired head to chemotherapy on his side . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the block@@ ages of persons who come to the side of the govern@@ or - which is a public forum , which is officially designated as officially and by staff who are paid with public tax Dollars - un@@ necessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ ard Spe@@ cher@@ in Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse the acts of the Govern@@ or and argu@@ ed that the block@@ ages of comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; but it is too easy to use the image of TR@@ OL@@ LEN or chambers , or h@@ ull @-@ filled people who goes online the lash . &quot;
&quot; the post spoke with some of the real people , who were blocked by H@@ og@@ an . &quot;
&quot; and these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , a ent@@ repren@@ eur and a past@@ or , not a role . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments respect@@ ful , thought@@ ful and not prof@@ iting . &quot;
the past@@ or c@@ ited the Bible in his post office and app@@ elli@@ ed to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
&quot; Law@@ yer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani by Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ ated , but she asked to h@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; I commented polite , that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate @-@ breaking and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary section of the mess@@ ing &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; I do not appreciate this idea if a number of people on the same topic takes position , then they will be dis@@ regarded by some rather than such a collective collective action , and not as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the employees of the Govern@@ ors signed as &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack , would other probably be &quot; inter@@ c@@ essors . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocks a cri@@ tic or a negative comment . &quot;
&quot; it is a lot of clean@@ ers as in former times when you have done the same , that employees were kid@@ n@@ apped to collect newspapers with critical guidelines and to burn or burn demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
but this is exactly what happened digital .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official that critic@@ ises Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp is charged by Twitter @-@ users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
&quot; the chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County the last the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to US @-@ District , James C. C@@ los@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when she called a voters from her Facebook page . &quot;
and in K@@ ent@@ uck@@ y received Govern@@ or Matt Be@@ in ( R ) also a visit from the AC@@ LU because of its use by Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so hard .
at the time Wash@@ ing@@ tons had a similar effect as the Internet .
&quot; the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous brief@@ er swal@@ low on his leadership . &quot;
and even at that time Washington was anonymous .
&quot; the people , the pse@@ ud@@ ony@@ ms like &quot; J@@ uri@@ cola , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; , &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; , &quot; wrote all letters of newspapers , Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions which have critic@@ ised its position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and the boat trip with Great Britain , the position , according to the historical documents , which were collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he did not have brought them to silence .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreements and dis@@ courses belong to the basis of our nation . &quot;
and true leadership means to accept this .
Ron@@ an Ra@@ ffer@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
&quot; the former Europeans No. 1 Ron@@ an Ra@@ ffer@@ ty will be hoping for local comfort in the next three days , as the Renaissance club held in East Lot@@ hi@@ an , 25 issue of Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who ran in the Ar@@ cher@@ field left until the end , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is linked to the new venue , and acts as a tournament @-@ owner in the name of the association and CE@@ O@@ s Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he reaches its glory with this event , &quot; said Ra@@ ffer@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from his best side , it is in a great state . &quot;
Jerry made a great job than he made this place .
he is a fre@@ ez@@ ing supporters of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great show@@ case for this course . &quot;
&quot; the UK E@@ ales look forward to defending a championship , although he has won a championship in his 32 @-@ year career in the European tour as well as the European Challenge Tour . &quot;
&quot; that really feels particularly an , &quot; said the in South@@ port there is a native player . &quot;
&quot; I did not defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open , as it was in the year after I had won them out of the program . &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on , last year here . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we will always be appreciated .
Gary Or@@ r who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year .
this event will be the first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you can also feel this extra print . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I have played a solid golf .
I am happy about how it worked .

&quot; over the past two decades , fewer people have died because of pas@@ sions of lung cancer . &quot;
at this result scientists of the university hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ ke ) come in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates a year 167 lung cancer is attri@@ but@@ able to Passi@@ v@@ rau@@ chen , &quot; said Study of Hei@@ ko B@@ echer . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he moved into an own study on this subject of 1994 . &quot;

the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health &quot; .
house@@ wif@@ es prove to be very complex
&quot; construction works in the Vill@@ inger street are in full swing and &quot; lie down in the time , &quot; as the head of the station Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the household items , the situation is more complicated than susp@@ ected as in the sub@@ str@@ ate much devast@@ ated , which is not dec@@ ei@@ ved in the plans . &quot;
&quot; the traffic , which always hin@@ der again the construction , is a big problem for the B@@ aut@@ ru@@ pp of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;

poverty and death in the ind@@ on@@ esian gold land
if B@@ ard@@ ina Deg@@ re@@ ei the dinner co@@ oks , they do not use a stove . &quot;
it even rarely used a pot .
&quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai govern@@ or in the un@@ quiet ind@@ on@@ esian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually places a sweet @-@ kart@@ off@@ el - locally as &quot; not@@ a &quot; &quot; - right in the fireplace . &quot;
after half an hour the shor@@ ten@@ ed Kn@@ ol@@ le will be taken with icy , un@@ washed hands and conc@@ iled . &quot;
Deg@@ re@@ am sitting on the ground floor - she has no furniture - where they also performs their daily work , e.g. clothes with tr@@ endy water from the nearby sw@@ amp to wash . &quot;
a bucket in a hom@@ eless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youn@@ gest of the four wives of their man , you have no fields assigned to . &quot;
Poly@@ gam@@ ie is listed here .
&quot; of course , late too can be too dangerous : most of the vill@@ men are unemployed , and many drink difficult , and there are the soldiers . &quot;
&quot; nobody den@@ ies it , after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the highlands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was taken in 1969 after a contro@@ versi@@ al referendum held in Indonesia as only 1.0@@ 26 El@@ ders in front of the occup@@ ying forces . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement that arise for independence against the Dutch rule , turned out rapidly against the government of Jak@@ arta , which holds control over the region and ex@@ cludes foreign journalists or legal monitoring . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially divided in Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , whereby the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea @-@ Neu@@ gu@@ ine@@ as was the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is so remote like it is . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provin@@ cial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car .
there is no public transport .
&quot; the town with about 19,@@ 000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , which are surrounded by bam@@ boo , and out of cor@@ rug@@ ged houses , which were converted by r@@ ost in different yellow @-@ brown tones . &quot;
&quot; very few Indon@@ esian made their journey here , weak@@ est because journalists and practically no foreig@@ ners . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans a God called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear this clothes , &quot; says Deg@@ re@@ ei and pointed to their livel@@ ier , hand@@ w@@ oven tur@@ ban , her dar@@ ker Shirt and her bright rock . &quot;
&quot; earlier we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is an Indon@@ esian province where 28 % of men live under the poverty line and some of the worst inf@@ ants and liter@@ acy rates in Asia have .
but it is also Indon@@ esian gold land .
&quot; the largest and profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a flo@@ ods in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 residents . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 Fre@@ ep@@ ort was built in 2015 in 2015 , fre@@ ep@@ ort was built in the value of 3,@@ 1 billion dollars of gold and copper . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Pap@@ ua has wooden resources worth estimated 78 billion US dollars . &quot;
&quot; however , these rich@@ es are however a source of mis@@ ery for the Pap@@ ua that make sure that Indon@@ esian military has maintained a ch@@ oked presence . &quot;
&quot; a study of 2005 reported in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort local militar@@ ists and units between 1998 and 2004 nearly 20 million US dollars paid , including up to 15@@ 0.000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ lian demands of greater autonomy threatened these Golden G@@ ans and will be treated gn@@ om@@ less .
&quot; according to the activists , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua have been killed and thousands have been displac@@ ed since 1969 from the ind@@ on@@ esian military , tor@@ tured and det@@ ained . &quot;
mass@@ ages in Pap@@ u@@ as tri@@ es@@ land in the 1970 @-@ years have been committed to gen@@ ocide in accordance with gen@@ ocide in accordance with the Asia Human Rights Commission .
only in the region the Indon@@ esian police last year more than 3.@@ 900 peaceful prot@@ esters .
&quot; we Wer@@ den Every@@ ing &quot; means it in a report of arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese Bris@@ bane from 2016 to contain reports of atro@@ cities of the previous year , such as legal exec@@ utions and torture - r@@ ape and electro@@ mobility are especially popular after another report - and the bru@@ tal precip@@ itation of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims because every week may happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ resear@@ cher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; the screws have reinforced , as Pap@@ u@@ as resources can produce a condition of settl@@ ers from other parts of Indonesia . &quot;
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is to 83 % Christian , but the demo@@ graphic development is changing , as Muslim economic migrants are changing from the most pop@@ ulated islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ aw@@ esi . &quot;

&quot; the migrants have begun , chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua to sell , &quot; explains A@@ beth You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ local , who moved to work in the provin@@ cial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
it has the native Pap@@ ua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the Women &#93; of Pap@@ ua .
&quot; the Indon@@ esian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , talked about the ine@@ qualities and infring@@ ements in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; the former Zimmer@@ mann , 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta . &quot;
&quot; but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we have voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with anticip@@ ation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice is restored , &quot; &quot; You said . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai was indeed just two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inaugur@@ ation in October a draft point . &quot;
on 7 December 2014 a group of 11 children outside and sang Christ@@ mas@@ der before a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , as two Indon@@ esian soldiers on a motorcycle by the darkness . &quot;
the sh@@ red@@ ded kids said to them that they should turn their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took the bre@@ ach of their tone , and later came back with four soldiers , so the local past@@ or Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had dr@@ unk , and swal@@ low@@ ed the group with their gun , said victim and witnesses . &quot;
then became one of the soldiers into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard to hit that he fell into the com@@ a . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby governmental commission set in fire and the things escal@@ ates the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered themselves on a football field in front of the local police station and the Military Centre to call justice . &quot;
they bore st@@ em@@ on@@ iel@@ le Jag@@ db@@ ö@@ gen and led the Wa@@ ita @-@ Dance - in the circle and a bird @-@ minded mim@@ ting - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators began to drag stones on police and military post .
&quot; when the atmosphere was heated , the soldiers was sent to a command over three times : &quot; when the masses had more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official document of TIME that has not been released in an official document of TIME that has not been released in the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ emi@@ as Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego Kot@@ o @-@ Four@@ t@@ els of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , looked the dro@@ ught danger and called for peace and called the crowd to go home . &quot;
nobody was listening in the mood .
&quot; when I turned out , I suddenly shot in my lin@@ kes hand wr@@ ist , he said TIME on the porch of his multi@@ color wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still does not know who was over@@ priced , but says that the sphere came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here . &quot;
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were over@@ priced , &quot; adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was struck three times , so his cous@@ in , the witness of the shooting was . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and subj@@ ected his body to make sure that he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who is like many Indon@@ esian only one name , the TIME in the dark mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I have kis@@ sed him .
&quot; the Che@@ et@@ spec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said Repor@@ ter that his officers &quot; want to secure their station only &quot; &quot; because they will be attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people dro@@ ught to kill us , &quot; said the speaker of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pud@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more viol@@ ates . &quot;
the news about the kill@@ ings arrived only on the following day &apos; filter@@ ed &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks took Jok@@ ow@@ i in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , a passionate speech in which he spoke sympath@@ ies for the families of victims and sw@@ or to tackle the historic ab@@ norm@@ alities in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case to be resolved right away , so that in the future he will no longer happen anymore , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; security Minister Wir@@ mer said in October 2016 , that he entered a court mechanism for the following historical human rights ab@@ uses . &quot;
but the talk began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; most inj@@ uries have gone a long time ago . &quot;
some were in the 90 @-@ s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ er years .
&quot; the point is that we have oblig@@ ated to address these violations , but there are processes that must go through . &quot;
&quot; then Wir@@ mer made a retreat , when he said on 5 June in Jak@@ arta with TIME and said , he did not have plans , in Pap@@ ua a complaint mechanism . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Wir@@ mer , indic@@ ted the UN for crimes against humanity &quot; crimes against humanity , said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Pap@@ ua had already been attached , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai inci@@ dent . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims are contrary to such claims with gri@@ pping un@@ believers .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear later .
&quot; I have fear , &quot; says he . &quot;
&quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , have fear to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ aco@@ bus reiter@@ ated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the inci@@ dent .
he says that he was struck by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought after me , &quot; he says . &quot;
found@@ ries have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indon@@ esian police on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighbourhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ er@@ ma , which ref@@ used to bring a conscious man into the hospital , died a person and 17 others were inj@@ ured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was er@@ un@@ ken , when he caught in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
scattered vill@@ agers prot@@ ested before the sit@@ ing office of the company .
&quot; the police said , that the vill@@ agers were on officers , who re@@ acted upon it , by hum@@ ank@@ ed war@@ ts . &quot;
but locals say that the mobile Brig@@ ade ( Indon@@ esian par@@ am@@ ilit@@ ary police ) began to shoot and one fat@@ al .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be re@@ ven@@ ge , &quot; &quot; says the 29 @-@ year Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i , who lives in the vicinity of the hospital and witness , as the previous one has been delivered quickly , so the TIME . &quot;
&quot; I hi@@ des two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called to withdraw the officers involved and withdraw the mobile Brig@@ ade of the police in the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a prime minister for the Indon@@ esian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development strength@@ ens the dis@@ satisfaction of the origin@@ als of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al that live in the green High@@ lands of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many closed the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) to defend the rebel@@ lion army , which claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by increasing the attacks and demonstrations of ind@@ on@@ esian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top @-@ O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in the past years thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai in the last few years , under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing national sovereignty . &quot;
some will never dive again .
&quot; among men in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as a tragic , for@@ get@@ ful place . &quot;
poverty strength@@ ens the dis@@ satisfaction .
&quot; the bit of rice , who is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for locals . &quot;
bread is just as a range .
people here are building everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruits and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can edit four or five fields of swe@@ eten@@ ers .
they keep the bulk of harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a precious only 10.000 Indon@@ esian R@@ up@@ ien ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
&quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the domestic Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown since the opening of new flu@@ kes to the airport Nab@@ ire in larger numbers . &quot;
&quot; the few jobs which exist in the region , usually go to the better trained and prosper@@ ous migrants . &quot;
Pap@@ ua rarely have the funds or the necessary skills to perform their own businesses competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John G@@ ob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribe of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , limitations of international media remain ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and bas@@ ille Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ in K@@ ine , the Dep@@ uty Asia @-@ Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is campaign to raise awareness and development to promote transparency and development . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists , trying to report from Indon@@ esian and west provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa @-@ den@@ ial and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indon@@ esian government remains largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March called six paci@@ f@@ ishes states - Tong@@ a , N@@ aur@@ u , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread inj@@ uries &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically been supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; the speaker of the ind@@ on@@ esian State Department of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a Nas@@ ir pointed the fores@@ een of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia still holds a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to toler@@ ate the evidence of human rights inci@@ dents . &quot;
people on site want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human right @-@ amb@@ assador K@@ ees Van B@@ aar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura on 4 May visited , bra@@ ins native her silence and fri@@ ght@@ ered him &quot; &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also took part in session but anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has a further presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua say that they are likely to be right again for Jok@@ ow@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sh@@ adows &quot; , &quot; says G@@ ob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribe of the tribe . &quot;
&quot; he wants to know that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it lives under the constant threat of an anti @-@ military military . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; gu@@ ilt &quot; &quot; which he must pay back . &quot;
&quot; they do not need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and in@@ tim@@ id@@ ation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sch@@ uss@@ op@@ fer resulted in the last symbo@@ lic act of Trotsky : the cor@@ ks of a sacrifice was buried on a terrain in front of the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they might know that they might never come to justice , but at least they do not forget those responsible for their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ aco@@ bus with soci@@ able head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire record the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scrap@@ ers of Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest living towers of the world in Dubai , and has hundreds of inhabitants from the 337 meters high , 79 @-@ stor@@ ey building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire , which is f@@ ake in just two years by the Hoch@@ haus , which is called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated , inj@@ uries have been reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept well and we are aw@@ ake in the fire of fire , and upon the cry of people . &quot;
&quot; we ran@@ ged the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor to come down , &quot; &quot; told a resident that named his name as George man , Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Dub@@ ais civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00.00 GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building cool@@ ed .
&quot; the government said , they work on the provision of accommodations for those affected . &quot;
&quot; the inci@@ dent can ask questions about the safety of materials , which are used in outer areas of sky@@ scrap@@ ers across the world . &quot;
&quot; a study conducted by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its brand in 2015 , that the largest portion of the damage caused by the gar@@ ments , the outdoor clothing for decoration or insulation . &quot;
&quot; in Britain , the police , she believe that the system of plates to insulation and clothing on the London Gren@@ fell @-@ tower in June have contributed to the rapid spread of a industry in which about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis courts ( IT@@ F ) has fallen through his big Davis Cup coup@@ oning at the General Assembly .
&quot; at the meeting in H@@ o Chi Min@@ h city , the proposal for this Sport Revolution@@ ary proposal , Davis Cup @-@ single was not only supported on two pay@@ ers , Hau@@ ch@@ thin not supported by the required two @-@ third majority . &quot;
&quot; although it is often very long , but even so very estimated five @-@ set classic stay remain the tradition of tradition . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3,@@ 54 percent of the member states voted for reform , the aim of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only barely missing . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members are not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these ic@@ onic and historical competitions , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
you will continue to work on improving the applic@@ ants .
&quot; at all , it was not only available for the vote after many intervention , the fin@@ als came to a neutral place in a neutral place . &quot;
&quot; new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively smaller details , so the fin@@ alists in Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in the future will be the host of the hosts in the first round . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the costs of the organiz@@ er , the requirements are facilit@@ ated in terms of training plans etc. and players will have to be completed prior to the Davis Cup less official media appointments . &quot;
more than 1 of 5 US travelers brings wast@@ ed items to the aircraft will find a survey
&quot; a survey conducted under flying passengers that more than 20 percent are fully aware or un@@ aware items to the check@@ points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent , which be@@ ats the aircraft , while they acci@@ dentally dimin@@ ished kni@@ ves or other items with plug@@ s . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 percent asser@@ ted , they could have noticed that they have travelled to be mist@@ aken with fire@@ arms , am@@ mun@@ ition or explo@@ si@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; the survey on more than 1,000 people - which was conducted by a Jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also fixed , that younger travellers rather ab@@ sent the rules . &quot;
&quot; from the respon@@ dents , the enc@@ ore have tried to fly with something that was forbidden by T@@ SA were 19,@@ 7 percent Mill@@ enni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X were . &quot;
&quot; the most common objects , which have been at T@@ SA @-@ agents , were food and flu@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; more than 3 percent , knowing who have borne items with kni@@ ves through the security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.7 per cent of the male respon@@ dents were also confirmed that they were v@@ ast@@ ed to the aircraft . &quot;
&quot; the company said , I asked travelers across the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally got sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed by the airport security and how many it had done it . &quot;
&quot; it is not a surprise that the people , the most ac@@ ly sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ware - wis@@ ely or un@@ certain - due to safety wear , those were the most frequently fly . &quot;
&quot; however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people are often uns@@ ure which flu@@ ids must take them or how much of it .
&quot; so , there is no surprise that the largest quantity of those of T@@ SA con@@ fis@@ c@@ ated items are wast@@ ed flu@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; a time thought , the people , the T@@ SA could see books as sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ware . &quot;
liqui@@ ds are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k is no matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la &apos;s order
&quot; elec@@ tro @-@ thous@@ and@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k prints with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; model 3 . &quot; &quot;
so far he has so far that part of the customer has already with@@ drawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
&quot; in addition to the always tri@@ umph@@ ant numbers of sales figures and still gig@@ antic sales targets , Tes@@ la leader El@@ on Mus@@ k has been revealed for the first time a different , less gl@@ oss numbers : the cancellation made by the new mass market 3 . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Mus@@ k has often applied more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery starts . &quot;
&quot; now , Mus@@ k is one : from the total of 5@@ 18.@@ 000 pre @-@ orders we have already with@@ drawn up again 6@@ 3.000 . &quot;
critics had always pointed out that it is merely a non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; in one cancellation pays Tes@@ la the 1,000 Euro ( in the US 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; Reser@@ vation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; currently there are 3@@ 5.000 of such non @-@ binding reservations , sp@@ atial Mus@@ k at a telephone conference with analy@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; however , that the cancellation of so far has about twelve per cent of all orders to become a problem , the Tes@@ la Chef does not believe . &quot;
&quot; its argument : the challenge among the ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production site . &quot;
&quot; in the last year , Tes@@ la 8@@ ,000 vehicles delivered . &quot;
&quot; 2018 should be taken together - all models - 500.@@ 000 , 2020 one million . &quot;
the demand for this is evident .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , there are currently per day 1800 reservations for this purpose . &quot;
&quot; who today &apos;s a &quot; model 3 &quot; , &quot; should you expect at the ear@@ liest half of 2018 with delivery - if Tes@@ la creates its brand new , never in practice without greater inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum utili@@ zation . &quot;
many experts believe that this is possible .
&quot; however , there will be a greater delays , then the in@@ ence of reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; for then , the company can not rede@@ em the un@@ satisfied customers , in hair . &quot;
EP@@ A @-@ Chef Pru@@ itt moves from the execution of the rules of Obama @-@ Er@@ a to reduce emissions
&quot; a day after having been charged by 15 states , Scott Pru@@ d@@ itt , the head of the environmental protection authorities , his former decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smo@@ g caused pollution . &quot;
&quot; Pru@@ itt presented the changes , as his agency proved to be the needs of state environmental authorities compared to respon@@ sive administr@@ ations . &quot;
he did not mention the law@@ suit against his previous position in a Federal Constitu@@ tional Court .
&quot; it is about a deadline , which ran on 1 October for states to keep the standards of 2015 for down @-@ down oceans . &quot;
&quot; in June , in June that he will keep the compliance with a year to study his authority more time to study the plan and avoid them to hin@@ der in local decisions , or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot;
&quot; Pru@@ itt , which was prior to his appointment by President Donald Tru@@ mp prosec@@ ut@@ or of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a long time a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental protection regulations . &quot;
&quot; since his arrival in Washington , Pru@@ itt repeatedly tried to block the regulations , or delay the chemical industry and industry of f@@ ossil fuels . &quot;
the su@@ dden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the most recent legal set@@ back for the Pru@@ section regulatory fil@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Constitu@@ tional Court in Washington decided that the EP@@ A stew@@ ard has exc@@ eeded his authority than he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , oil and gas companies for monitoring and reducing meth@@ ane lec@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; in an on Wednesday night , it was suggested that his kne@@ eling at Oz@@ on@@ ism is quite simply the willingness of EP@@ A to co @-@ operation with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of new standards . &quot;
&quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EP@@ A often did the dead@@ lines for carrying out and then awa@@ ited by activ@@ ist groups and others , and in an agreement to set the appointment for the execution , &quot; said Pru@@ itt , the EP@@ A more than a do@@ zen time in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot;
&quot; we also take the law and authority that gives us serious . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the opinion of EP@@ A that Pru@@ itt at some point out his &quot; &quot; authority to delay and all other legal assistance &quot; &quot; will be used to ensure that the provisions &quot; based on a solid policy and the best available information is based . &quot;
the Republi@@ can in Congress pushing an exhaus@@ tive new version of the oceans .
one in the last month approved bill sh@@ ouldn &apos;t hesitate to delay the implementation of the rules of 2015 at least eight years .
the measure was not yet to be set up in the Sen@@ ate .
&quot; the New York @-@ Direc@@ tor@@ ate General Assembly , Eric Sch@@ der@@ man , who led the Co@@ alition of the States who had passed the EP@@ A in this week , said , the group inten@@ ds to maintain the legal pressure . &quot;
&quot; the conversion of EP@@ A - according to our sounds - is an important win for health and safety of these 6.6 million New Yor@@ kers and the about 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g , who are flowing into their congreg@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ia , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot;
&quot; soil @-@ oceans emerg@@ es , when contamin@@ ants from cars , power stations , oil painting , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere on sun@@ light respond . &quot;
the dra@@ in smo@@ g can cause serious respir@@ atory problems that contribute to thousands of premature death cases every year .
representatives of the public health system and the environ@@ ment@@ alist che@@ ered over the round of surprising change .
&quot; it is disturb@@ ing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from those responsible for protecting the air we inhal@@ e , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Biological Diversity . &quot;
&quot; we must continue to fight against the ide@@ ological Crus@@ ade of the Tru@@ mp government , on environmental pollution and their particular interests . &quot;
Tum@@ m@@ ons celeb@@ rates 750 years St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 years St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche is invited to the old cemetery A@@ real in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , 16 July , at 16.@@ 30 pm to a Ser@@ en@@ ade . &quot;

the visitors of the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be ench@@ anted by this powerful place .
the rescue and conservation of the oldest building in the place have made friends and promot@@ er tum@@ ours to their concerns .
Walter Mart@@ ini stres@@ ses : &quot; it is a unique d@@ ör@@ f@@ ty Klein@@ od . &quot;
&quot; in 1267 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was mentioned for the first time in Wür@@ ttem@@ berg@@ ische Ur@@ customer book : Graf Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain with that &apos;s par@@ ish church on Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard by Hor@@ b and at his brother Diet@@ rich for 20 Mark Silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the wor@@ ding of the judgment after the tum@@ or mountain , apart from the un@@ inhabited par@@ ish church , to which the church or the pat@@ ron@@ ats@@ law belong@@ ed to the church , and not the other way round . &quot;
so there was also people there .
&quot; as from the description of the Upper Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still known today in the village picture of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the splendid settl@@ ers of the village . &quot;
old cards from the time around 1600 under@@ pin these historical circumstances .
the pat@@ ron@@ ats@@ Law was created from the early medieval owner .
&quot; a Lord who built a church , and he occupied with a past@@ or , still remained peculi@@ ar of this church and could also ver@@ b these peculi@@ ar . &quot;
that was the right to use a past@@ or or to the Bishop of a new par@@ ish .
three alt@@ ars were in the church and two bells in the tower .
the biggest of the two cerem@@ onial on Christmas 1673 .
&quot; the newly created bells was then 16@@ 92 , but had to be dis@@ closed later in the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
in the 30 @-@ year @-@ old war ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the sh@@ utter pul@@ leys were pushed and the bel@@ lows were st@@ olen .
the roof was un@@ dense .
1796 @-@ made French troops close to the church .
they bra@@ ked the pul@@ pit and par@@ ables and used them as fire@@ wood .
remains of the Church threatened in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ linger Help cemetery also served as the last retirement for the dead coming from listening .
1823 was expanded to the cemetery and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was abandoned .
only the Kir@@ cht@@ ur@@ m can be left .
in the New Year @-@ eight 18@@ 34 sp@@ ed a storm the Kir@@ cht@@ ur@@ m and half over@@ thre@@ w .
&quot; to prevent an un@@ happiness , the tower became broken . &quot;
only the today available Tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g stayed as a witness of the 750 year old church history .

the association aims to examine the approval of wind@@ cycles
&quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim does not look no legal prerequis@@ ite for the construction and therefore turned towards the govern@@ ement .
&quot; the association &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; has encouraged Council of Andreas Co@@ ils ( CD@@ U ) to make its approval for the establishment of planned wind turbin@@ es in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . &quot;
it is illegal .
the association argu@@ ed that at the time of the approval of 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette had no wind turbin@@ es could have been approved as at the time in Vier@@ sen just at the city border to Schwal@@ m@@ tal has existed a wind power @-@ concent@@ ric zone .
&quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbin@@ es are generally possible , at the same time , the concentration of concentration , and the exclusion of wind turbin@@ es for the rest of the region . &quot;
der@@ lei zones to prevent one &quot; &quot; economical &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot;
&quot; the city district was decided not only a few days before , due to a change of the surface area in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , which had not approved the district government Düsseldorf , not approved because of a form . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planned legal prerequis@@ ite , the divided author@@ is@@ ations is still un@@ law@@ ful and therefore also to increase , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; current status of things : the city entered the wind with@@ standing area in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette before the summer break ; a licence of the district government is still standing . &quot;
&quot; in this place , the assessment of a permit for the establishment of wind turbin@@ es are strictly prohibited . &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the invitation .
&quot; the corresponding letter have been made since last week in the district Vier@@ sen , &quot; explained a spok@@ es@@ person . &quot;
the circle is taking it on the occasion to examine the aff@@ air again .
but they do not likely lead to that the procedure is stopped .
&quot; with views of the administrative procedure at the administrative Court , the circle of Thursday wanted to be aw@@ ful to the reas@@ oning of the Association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette the construction of four , 200 meters high wind@@ wheels . &quot;
&quot; already last year , the company had involved in which the city of Vier@@ sen is taking part in P@@ acht@@ al agreements with the owner of about 65 hectares of large money . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of the four wind turbin@@ es , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households can be covered - this is equivalent to approximately one @-@ fifth of all four households . &quot;
the NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros .
&quot; in the summer of summer , four , she stood green light for the purchase of three wind turbin@@ es in the wind park Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen , as well as a stake in a wind turbin@@ es in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg . &quot;
car and tractor kra@@ chen together : woman dies with terrible accident

&quot; these include new offers such as the first &quot; &quot; active @-@ day &quot; &quot; to the fountain @-@ resistant Sunday , talks with all ge@@ ons @-@ ups and hosts to move it to active participation . &quot;
&quot; also attractive offers on the Saturday and the sale on parking fees on this day are part of the concept . &quot;
&quot; in addition , customer potential must be re@@ inv@@ ented again or again . &quot;
these include boarding and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the downtown at shopping from the glance .
&quot; at the end all , all will help to reward the city centre - to land@@ lords , the factories throughout the city and associations . &quot;
&quot; it worked with a network the Le@@ th@@ arg@@ ie to overcome , which have been some brei@@ t@@ led , had said king in spring . &quot;

Tru@@ mp was replaced by phone calls from teleph@@ oning Mexico under pressure due to payment of the border wall
tran@@ scription by phone calls between US @-@ president Donald Tru@@ mp and leaders from Mexico and Australia have been published by Washington Post .
&quot; on 27 January Tru@@ mp was called by Tru@@ mp in a telephone booth with the Mexican President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to , publicly mention that he would pay for a planned border wall . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. president acc@@ used him , because he had publicly announced the wall , and say he said to him , &quot; This will not say you the press . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp launched its presidential campaign to build a wall to the southern border of the USA , and sw@@ an , Mexico for the project to pay . &quot;
tran@@ scription of his first settlement with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp said Mr. Turn@@ bull said that trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia , &quot; ridi@@ cul@@ ous &quot; , &quot; mies &quot; and &quot; stup@@ id &quot; &quot; and that the existence of the government was con@@ veys , like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; , &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the USA . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp ended the call , after having said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; this is the most uncomfortable call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ores Ford mass@@ ac@@ re : activists led rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
&quot; a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury was driving through a group of viewers in rural Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and covered the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver that was able to reach the bridge , a group of white men joined the bridge to block his way . &quot;
the leader of the Mob@@ s - a man average age in a needle @-@ suit - took a long train at its cig@@ ar and looked at the wind@@ shield .
&quot; inside , the in@@ mates in fear . &quot;
&quot; we want this n ec@@ r Roger ! &quot; &quot; brood the man . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ l him from the car ! &quot;
Schrei@@ e cr@@ ush@@ ed the silence , as a young black man sh@@ attered by the passenger . &quot;
&quot; fortunately this terrible scene , which was played on July 22 , just a retro@@ fit . &quot;
&quot; but when then a loop around the neck &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; is thrown , almost all in the public very genuine S@@ eu@@ f@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 we come back to the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge back to im@@ itate the night , in the two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , and George and Ma@@ e Murray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u K@@ lux Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
no one has ever been charged for the dawn .
&quot; it really is in@@ concei@@ vable that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our communities though we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks , who helps in the organization of retro@@ fit . &quot;
&quot; it is a mud@@ dy on a story , but it is a burden of our souls . &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year old congress of the State of Georgia and a Life of Civil Rights .
&quot; for him , the after@@ position as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual memory of the Mon@@ roe community that has never been correc@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; we want to pro@@ secution , we want to end we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must get justice , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; we cannot get healing and reconciliation , until we get justice . &quot;
a cour@@ aged man sets out a beg@@ gar about the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford Lyn@@ ch on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to F@@ BI files , which were obtained from the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding county was susp@@ ected . &quot;
but no one has ever been charged .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects for decades remain in the open foot , civil justi@@ fy that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch events in the whole city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision of the Supre@@ me Court of Justice took place its voice in Georgia for the first time , in the summer of the summer . &quot;
&quot; about the same time as choosing st@@ ach according to the F@@ BI of black Far@@ mp@@ et Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a battle - suppos@@ edly for a woman . &quot;
&quot; Bro@@ oks said , the rum@@ or in the city had been that H@@ ester was slept with Mal@@ ah &apos;s wife Dor@@ othy , and that the baby that she carried , not from her husband . &quot;
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land hostess , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the F@@ BI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cous@@ ins Ma@@ e Murray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
&quot; but when they went away from the prison and move the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , ring@@ ed a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison that has been prepared and arranged it , includes a F@@ BI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a com@@ mander between state and local criminal investigation , which was not only involved in the murder , evidence and identity of witnesses . &quot;
Bro@@ oks , it is form@@ ul@@ ates it yet . &quot;
&quot; it was a constitu@@ ent mass@@ ac@@ re , &quot; &quot; said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed , to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , then you will happen here . &quot;
almost a decade long the Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual post @-@ position of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
&quot; their account is vi@@ vid , erg@@ ent , and is founded in a kind of deep@@ ening rac@@ ism , of which many believe he is no longer exists in America . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to look , and even harder to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch , because we will be confronted with its hon@@ esty in all of us , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; but I cannot build any relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or not want to hear what I have done . &quot;
&quot; the samples for this year @-@ old production began in June , and on the first day , almost 30 actors - a do@@ zen past@@ ure and the rest Schwar@@ ze - into a space and loud , as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ pointed overview of the piece started . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ director .
&quot; he has played the role of the Chef @-@ C@@ lan@@ mit@@ gli@@ eds since years , but he said , the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty , because I am not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it is very important to get this story alive , because we would not want to return to these times . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the room , the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ cona , the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester playing their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester , and hung it , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy slept . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he , we@@ ars of my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona er@@ wi@@ dens the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene lau@@ gh at loud .
&quot; what ? ! &quot; , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still k@@ ich@@ ern@@ d . &quot;
I don &apos;t think that white people at that time &apos; n --- he &apos; said &apos; .
&quot; but , &quot; wit@@ aw@@ nings of one of the other black per@@ former . &quot;
&quot; you only need to meet the hard &apos; R. &apos; . &quot;
&quot; and that is exactly where the energy in the room , a feeling of comrades replace the discomfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy trying to get this correctly , not only because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene starts again .
&quot; this time when Ras@@ cona says the N @-@ word , he says it sharp and with night pressure . &quot;
absolutely no one laugh@@ s .
this repeti@@ tion ends violent and fast .
&quot; there are typ@@ ing , shots , and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman , bo@@ died with a dream dress , stands over the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actor and carries out Billi@@ e Holidays mour@@ ern@@ de Lob@@ ster &quot; St@@ range Fru@@ it &quot; . &quot; &quot;
your voice is breaking up with every second word .
about a hundred metres behind it a group of about four do@@ zen audience swe@@ ating and t@@ ears from the eyes .
the audience is almost syn@@ onymous between black and white .
&quot; one pair is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , performed to see the performance , many come down the road . &quot;
they all have seen almost eight hours in Georgi@@ as oppressed moist@@ ure if Bro@@ oks them leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the painter and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; up to this point , the Mor@@ de have stayed one an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now when you found on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de stops , the air feels s@@ wind@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the song , Gre@@ ene invites the quantity to come closer and insp@@ ects the body name . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ cken on their ch@@ efs , sign the counter@@ f@@ eit blood and the breast@@ feeding body and whis@@ per@@ ing each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ m@@ elt a little boy , as w@@ ool to remember it . &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene the quantity - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw the Lyn@@ ch@@ sei@@ l and wake her t@@ ears .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh that has played the man in the An@@ suit .
Nick Ras@@ cona um@@ shot two of his fellow @-@ players and then breaks out into her arms to cr@@ ying the emotional burden of the performance .
&quot; it is okay , &quot; whis@@ per@@ ed one of the women . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you did this from one reason . &quot;
&quot; later , the audience agree with the actors for dinner together . &quot;
&quot; at a table chat a white pair from Atlan@@ ta stim@@ ulated over the after@@ position with a black couple , which they have just made acquain@@ ted . &quot;
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ ski fig@@ hts to find words which feeling the ab@@ duction left .
&quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and acts to hear ... from people who look like you look , because they look like you , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what really does with me , let me believe that the Lyn@@ ch is still going on , &quot; she added , &quot; today , the only police force is called . &quot;
&quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks yard in his table , he is@@ st and reminds of the civil rights . &quot;
&quot; he said , he already started to plan the performance in the next year . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ position is inspir@@ ational in a way of inspir@@ ational , because it describes the fri@@ ght of what we er@@ wear , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is so when we learn nothing of it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; who does not study his own history , who knows his own history is condem@@ ned to repeat them . &quot;

I moved a positive Res@@ um@@ é .
max amount is working as a volunteer
they work in a voluntary year right at several places .
where everywhere ?
&quot; quantity : usually in St@@ einf@@ urt in the Mö@@ bel@@ b@@ ör@@ se , once a week , I set here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I already worked in the open all day at school .
what are your experiences with it ?
&quot; quantity : it is a nice , wide spectrum I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; now they are 26 years , thus a late @-@ professional volunteer . &quot;
how does that come ?
quantity : I made Ab@@ it@@ ur .
&quot; and then a building process , we say that we have successfully completed . &quot;
&quot; I realized for me that it is the fal@@ seh@@ ood , and I will do something else , with people work . &quot;
and then I asked me what is you doing .
&quot; going a social year since there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , on the focal point may be , really . &quot;
and was it so ?
quantity : I have collected great impressions .
I will launch my studies in the winter semester .
I will study dual study and probably do a social working vocational training and studi@@ ere in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hoch@@ schule .
is it not un@@ common during the volunteer services to have several different types of applications ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it always comes along where one makes his F@@ S@@ J .
one can make it from Alter@@ sheim to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social labour .
with me it was very varied .
&quot; I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care . &quot;
for me that was exactly the right thing that gave me straight .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really going .
different than in the building of the building itself ?
&quot; quantity : well clear , here it is not about to rest . &quot;
&quot; there is always other people in my head , which each have a different story behind . &quot;
&quot; if a refu@@ gee , whether a youth who has been fet@@ ched from the family - you must always go individually . &quot;
very interesting .
and you did not have any connection ?
&quot; quantity : for this , I am not the guy . &quot;
there is one area that gives a lot .
&quot; great love , much kindness . &quot;
&quot; there is also negative moments , but so is life just . &quot;
&quot; Pear@@ son shor@@ ten@@ ed more 3,000 jobs and cut divi@@ dend to revi@@ ve the business . &quot;
&quot; the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , they will cut more 3,000 jobs and cut its sub@@ divi@@ dend by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will start to overcome the pressur@@ es with which the company is confronted . &quot;

&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the self @-@ ordin@@ ations in Kab@@ ul has also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policy and especially in the call of President As@@ hr@@ af G@@ han@@ i . &quot;
EP@@ A returns decision to delay the smo@@ g rule after a complaint
&quot; the US American environmental authorities has committed to delay a decision to regul@@ ate the government of Obama to delay , what the states are oblig@@ ated to dimin@@ ish the states that smo@@ g @-@ caused emissions took place . this took place a day after 15 states the agency due to the pac@@ ed def@@ endants . &quot;
&quot; the EP@@ A announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the &quot; &quot; Oz@@ on@@ cology 2015 &quot; &quot; and said , they show showing the commitment of the agency , with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and considering that we react on our state partners , &quot; said EP@@ A @-@ Chief Scott Pru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; in June the intention of EP@@ A announced the intention of EP@@ A to be measured in a part of the land poll@@ ut@@ ants , in which in a part of the land poll@@ ut@@ ant emissions should be measured to delay where inser@@ ting standards - to delay a year until October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 largely democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , travelled on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried , a wide range of environmental impact , which has risen by the former President Barack Obama , as part of a broader agenda , which is to boost growth and boost growth according to Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have triggered the backl@@ ash of democr@@ ats and conservation groups that are worried about the effects of greater emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the EP@@ A website tells that the breath of air , the oceans contains &quot; &quot; the pul@@ pit function &quot; &quot; and rein@@ force the an@@ xi@@ ous sympt@@ om &quot; as as@@ thma . &quot;
community :
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : with two oppos@@ ites , the municipal council of Flu@@ orn @-@ win@@ ks , the establishment of a common area in the future Sen@@ iors . &quot;
&quot; in front of the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase agreement signed for the remaining missing piece was signed , tells Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; although it is still going to last until the so far the par@@ ish @-@ owned area in the common ownership is , but there is no planning for that of a private investor to st@@ em@@ am@@ eful project more . &quot;
there is a discussion about a common area .
&quot; one of the two investors who are still in the boat , has offered to the community . &quot;
&quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - approximately 55 square meter - and an adjacent terrace with all 70 square meters area for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the management and the majority of the municipal council is before , such a common room not as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of the home @-@ friendly residence , but open into the church . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word made from the &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the decision is made by the provision of funds for the ongoing household has already been decided in the past autumn , through funding options . &quot;
the building lies in the refurb@@ ishment area .
&quot; the de@@ cor of a common area would be , so reported T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent to be eligible . &quot;
&quot; the decisions taken to sign@@ alize the investor to sign@@ alling that in this respect , the soli@@ dity of the legs will take that both at the environment - which reduces the height @-@ height - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - which makes it possible to reduce the com@@ plex@@ ing and the construction of economic makes it possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less , so do not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , be this addition . &quot;
if &apos;s helps : un@@ anim@@ ously happened to the panel .
not so easy it goes to the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s reputation refers to the many of their own buildings , with which one cannot move so right now , to do so far from the common room from the window , she says : &quot; I do not get me hard with it . &quot;
Y@@ vonne Sta@@ iger speaks for the common room - but absolutely against communist participation .
it looks behind it a con@@ forms of in@@ vention in any case mist@@ ress@@ ful or even warmer investors .
&quot; this is not so , because with the acquisition of the surface there is no subsi@@ dy , but do not come a real , in the second @-@ drop @-@ market counter@@ part , is the return . &quot;
&quot; Sta@@ ig@@ &apos;s application , for the decisions that arise accordingly , finds three ap@@ prehen@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; so it stays with two oppos@@ ites in the original program , the Stefan H@@ aller so summar@@ ized : &quot; if we summar@@ ise the decision , we make a giant move into our infrastructure . &quot;

&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical constitution , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot;
this was last not good . &quot;
the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official compul@@ s@@ ory game of the season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows that qualities .
the crew is ready .
&quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football weight@@ ed moves the fans into their spell .
&quot; the parti@@ tions is sold with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spect@@ ators , divided the Deutsche Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday . &quot;
in Har@@ z from Stern to Stern
&quot; in Har@@ z , the nation@@ wide first &quot; Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; is to arise . &quot;
this is planning the association observ@@ atory San@@ kt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planetary path in Gött@@ ingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; &quot; come to the information meeting of many Har@@ z@@ visitors , was called it . &quot;
&quot; he connect nature , science , exercise and spor@@ ty performance . &quot;
members want to stand along the planned route range and inform on it over stars and star pictures .
&quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association is planning &quot; well accomplished installations to five to six locations &quot; in the Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; ask the St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Bra@@ un@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß , and Si@@ eber &quot;
the information on the boards should be added via internet .
&quot; therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the sit@@ ing selection . &quot;
also Acc@@ es@@ sibility is a c@@ rit@@ erion .
later the Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad train is to be extended by train .
&quot; on the starb@@ ase , the viewer will experience a lot of knowledge about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; stated the association . &quot;
&quot; in addition they learned , why stars have different colors or why a star becomes stronger than another , although it is much further away . &quot;
&quot; also con@@ veys , in what con@@ stellation can be a selected star and when he is best to see . &quot;
&quot; the association has been working in the Berg@@ städ@@ c St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest star observ@@ atory in northern Italy since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the location in the heart of the National Park of Har@@ z , according to the Federal Ministry of Natural protection for the six dark regions in Germany . &quot;
&quot; frequently , from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a @-@ galaxy with mere eye can see clearly . &quot;
in the Un@@ i City since 2003 there has been some simil@@ arities between the planned Stern@@ en@@ wer@@ g - the planned Stern@@ en@@ wer@@ g - the Plan@@ etary Route .
&quot; starting before prayer Hotel near the Goe@@ the@@ al@@ lee , which forms the inside of our solar system , the planetary path leads up to the Hain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as a &quot; extra @-@ ter@@ restrial location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( Municip@@ ality ) with the Planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the st@@ akes with the individual planets - including the Zwer@@ g@@ plan@@ ed degra@@ ded Pl@@ uto at the end point - are exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth shr@@ inking so on a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters diameter , while the sun is about 70 meters away , after 70 cen@@ tim@@ eters . &quot;
the entire distance of the planetary path is just four kilometers .
&quot; while the light needed from sun to Pl@@ uto takes about eight hours , ped@@ estri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Pl@@ uto . &quot;
pedestrian are thus faster than light in the cosmos .
the march to the next fix@@ ing would still take a half year .
Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time to discuss a possible show@@ down
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia , who should stand in a coll@@ ision le@@ urs in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ locked world pit champion , the hall@@ way down to Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Box@@ ing Organisation Super @-@ Feder@@ er Champion Champion . &quot;

I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Satur@@ day@@ evening at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
&quot; when the couple of photos posi@@ ble , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as , that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect size . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight &quot; , &quot; remember@@ ed Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; I have asc@@ ended for bronze &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so big . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to go down .
and he must move on a weight @-@ weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
this demand the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko is atmosph@@ eric .
&quot; boxing needs this battle . &quot;
&quot; climate , asked if it should be on pay @-@ per view , part of a strategy , Lom@@ ach@@ enko has to fight a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia a date ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) that also interest in the battle against the winner of J@@ orge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their lightweight title in the forum on September 23 . &quot;
&quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ by @-@ View mode , because all fans asked for him , &quot; said Gar@@ cia and oppressed you later to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , he sh@@ aves Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; a tremendous fighter , &quot; and he may possibly take part in his Saturday struggle . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko stopped at the great praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he think of the Trinity Champion of River@@ side &quot; very slowly , sorry Mik@@ ey ... you are still playing the co @-@ off . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , the focus is to show impact , then boxes . &quot;
&quot; they said , they could feel the Mom@@ entum , which is felt for the own struggle . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the struggle , which needs to be performed . &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work , &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko said : &quot; I wa@@ ited to the top fighters and that is Mik@@ ey .
it will be a great battle . &quot;
four Com@@ passes to Rei@@ fen@@ plat@@ zer
during an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon four people were difficult to inj@@ ured .
&quot; after first information , the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira against 16.@@ 30 is just before the junction of market probably after a tire plat@@ zer control over his vehicle . &quot;
&quot; the car bur@@ nt to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he sm@@ ote himself and then stayed on the roof in the GR@@ Ü@@ N@@ ST@@ RE@@ IF@@ EN . &quot;
the four passengers - two adults and two children - were heavy inj@@ ured during the accident .
&quot; during the initial supply of the past through the bail@@ out service , the A7 in the direction of the north was locked into the north for about an hour , then the traffic on the left will be guided on the left @-@ hand corner . &quot;
For@@ tun@@ as Hoff@@ mann : &quot; Trinity works better &quot;
&quot; And@@ re Hoff@@ mann was looking after 2 : 2 to the season , against Br@@ uns@@ wick , that the optimization of the def@@ enses in Au@@ e points . &quot;
&quot; with the first season And@@ re Hoff@@ mann was happy with the result , would not be the two oppos@@ ites at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two oppos@@ ites too much , and we need to fit in Au@@ e even better , &quot; &quot; says the def@@ enses of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the Tri@@ erk@@ ats shall also continue to be optimized .
and one goal in one of the bre@@ ach do not want to manifest the For@@ tun@@ es .
for the future there will be no more besides Michael ( R@@ ensing ) to the line .
&quot; Hoff@@ mann is convinced that his team will also cope with the experiences in preparation with the three @-@ chain , as with the four @-@ chain . &quot;
&quot; yet I don &apos;t know how we are going to act in Au@@ e , but Hoff@@ mann is sure of his cause , because we are just in the tri@@ ck on the semi @-@ positions in KA@@ AN Ay@@ han and N@@ iko G@@ ud@@ el@@ mann players who can build well , &quot; said Hoff@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; the requirement is , but that we are still in harmony with us and we do not have to do so many dis@@ rup@@ tions . &quot;
naturally also Hoff@@ mann goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; but if one cannot speak according to a mis@@ sil@@ ly start , don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could well be okay , &quot; &quot; said Hoff@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; if we can take on Sunday with four points and we can concentrate on the Pok@@ al , we will certainly be able to talk of a decent season . &quot;
of which his trainers wanted nothing to know .
&quot; the start in the season I would only come after six to eight players &quot; , &quot; said cemetery Funk@@ el , who does not want to talk from an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be broken up because of a dish@@ on@@ age . &quot;
&quot; now they can begin the season quasi with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoff@@ mann believes that players from Au@@ e may be even a bit of fresh , since they had no heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a ascent @-@ sf@@ avor@@ ites in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know so 100 @-@ process where they are at present , &quot; &quot; says the def@@ ender of the Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; though , guests from the Rhin@@ eland go as a lighter Favor@@ it on Sunday in the encounter at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we f@@ end them , only because we have the claim to come under the first six , is Bl@@ ö@@ d@@ sense , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance sheet is at only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which one has to hit by vor@@ n@@ in , explains For@@ tun@@ as Chief coach . &quot;
&quot; such a statement to meet would be arro@@ gan@@ t and Hebrew . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el wants to experience his players on Sunday in no way .
new results of the Swedish asylum seek@@ er tests published
&quot; the recent findings of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which have been subj@@ ected to a new method for medical evaluation of their age , show that over 80 percent of the tested persons older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authority of for@@ ensic medicine ( Rät@@ ts@@ medic@@ inal@@ with@@ et ) has started with the realisation of the tests last year .
&quot; they are to be more precise during the asylum seek@@ ers , after the Swedish mig@@ rant Authority ( migration negoti@@ ation ) has been critic@@ ised for mistakes in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees , which were min@@ ated years old . &quot;
&quot; until today , migration has been sent to test@@ ing cases and the For@@ ensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of 2,@@ 481 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; eight percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in other 25 cases the For@@ ensic Medicine Agency will be evaluated that the person &quot; may 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; in 432 cases , the conclusion that the person is &quot; possibly under 18 years old . &quot;
tests will only be carried out in cases where the person will be asked in question .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from For@@ ensic Medicine Agency , the results are stable during the past months . &quot;
&quot; we do not see huge difference in statistics of last months , the numbers are fairly constant &quot; , &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high proportion of cases , in which the person has been judged than over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers has taught over its age . &quot;
&quot; in May , the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases to suggest that the signed person 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bl@@ a@@ igns the 581 published results , they firmly believed that in 243 of these cases the person had openly told that she will be in this year 18 years old . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age evaluation , analy@@ sed in x @-@ rays and MR@@ T recordings are analy@@ sed , which will then be analy@@ sed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , was also cri@@ tici@@ zed in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a sc@@ aler is the En@@ doc@@ kr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus the Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute , whose work includes ass@@ essing the biological stimul@@ i of people , to see if they were sooner or later than by pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t believe that the type of measurement should be used . &quot;
assess the biological age in this way is very uns@@ afe .
&quot; if we cannot say it , we should not do so as if we could it , &quot; he said the paper metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from For@@ ensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; generally , you can say that the risk to judge a child as an adult . &quot;
&quot; the largest risk is in that if the person is below 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the plan
working on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are moving well .
&quot; on Wednesday , a seven ton was installed on the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it works great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , buil@@ ders at the Department of Street and Transport in the Government of the Council of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , the work began at the same time in all three san@@ itation bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the building is planned for October and is sure that the schedule will be respected .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a v@@ ault bridge out of concrete , which is dis@@ gu@@ ised with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein , and has a total @-@ length of 4,@@ 80 meters . &quot;
it was built in the year 1900 .
&quot; as the two other bridges , it is now in the years come . &quot;
&quot; to ensure the stability and road safety , the three structures are now thoroughly refurb@@ ished . &quot;
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .

Af@@ ro@@ de in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ unter protest with German Pot@@ ato sal@@ ad
&quot; yes , not so frequently , that parties are moving at a string , but if it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , what else is difficult to bring under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties in the circle of volcan@@ ic parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad coalition , which shows on this day peaceful flag , because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle Ron@@ dell for the noisy poster of the great election campaign . &quot;
&quot; and known names of the start brings - like Alice Wei@@ del , which serves along with Alexander Gau@@ land , the top duo for the bund@@ le choice on 24 September , and the Dep@@ uty Chairman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are already at the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ ro@@ gers , but to demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Ei@@ fel remains b@@ unt . &quot;
&quot; originally planned the city @-@ pic@@ nic under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; at the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but can now be held on the car park below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who arrive at the Af@@ D event . &quot;
a colorful picture that has to offer .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chairman of the Forums One World and one of the leading organis@@ ators , really is happy : &quot; great , how many people came here together . &quot;
&quot; there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; original pot@@ ato sal@@ ad , which could also eat the Af@@ D without problems , &quot; says the woman who brought him . &quot;
&quot; the police took many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence in particular even at the railway station , which is only a few meters from the venues . &quot;
how is the Af@@ D actually reached to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reported from the Af@@ D volcan@@ oes reported that he attempts to make such an event and get the supplement .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first found in Dau@@ n , but there was not enough parking because of the already built Laur@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes does not exist enough parking . &quot;
&quot; so the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is happy that we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; with a view of the event at the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , he says : &quot; this is the good right of people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; this also does : against 20 o &apos;clock ensures a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle several speakers , including the tor@@ land @-@ pf@@ alz Af@@ D @-@ President Uwe Junge . &quot;
&quot; in the hall about 200 listen@@ ers , who are waiting that the Spit@@ enk@@ andi@@ d@@ atin for the bund@@ le choice , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Dep@@ uty Chairman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch hold their speeches . &quot;
&quot; unchanged is the police present , but so far the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; slightly more than an hour takes the Af@@ gh@@ an event , the guests on the court have a longer breath , but also there is short after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police can dis@@ move - no special inci@@ dents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; a re@@ ven@@ ge with the Wolf@@ acher tro@@ mb@@ ist Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is in the series has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm in the Kloster@@ church . &quot;
&quot; together with the Bulgarian Tro@@ mp@@ eter Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ v Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea , &quot; or even &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ folklore &quot; &quot; meets a classical German education with roots in the blad@@ der music . &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have sol@@ op@@ osi@@ tions in European leaders .
so Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter with the renowned Concer@@ tgeb@@ ouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ aun@@ ist of SWR Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; both combines the desire to not only exceed the borders on their instruments , but also the limits of various gen@@ res . &quot;
&quot; this sounds Johann Sebastian Bach with the two as in a new gun , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; World music &quot; united with Bulgarian Fol@@ klore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the J@@ azz@@ ech@@ op@@ hil@@ str@@ ä@@ gers N@@ ils W@@ og@@ ram , cosmic classical , jazz and free games to a fascinating overall work . &quot;
this core of the program was only shown this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ og@@ ram has written it independently for the two musicians and more still : the has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ kirche with their special aco@@ us@@ tics will be deliber@@ ately included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Stew@@ art speaks about her bis@@ exual
&quot; some people love gr@@ illed cheese , and will eat him to the end of their lives . &quot;
&quot; but I want to try out everything , so Kri@@ sten Stew@@ art very openly about their Bis@@ exual . &quot;
&quot; when I sit in gr@@ illed cheese , I think : &apos; Oh this was cool , what comes as a neighb@@ our ? &apos; . &quot;
the most well @-@ known relationship of the mystery of the stars was the too her &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleagues Robert P@@ att@@ inson who ultimately rose up bitter .
&quot; despite all , the insur@@ ed Dar@@ stell@@ erin compared to the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; I was in loving every seriously I mean . &quot;
&quot; or do you believe about , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after their separation there was critics , that she was bis@@ exual , &quot; I have always lived du@@ alism and seriously believed it . &quot;
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered .
I just never liked it to be taken seriously .
&quot; especially among them , they suffered according to &quot; Bang Show@@ biz &quot; but in the school time , when they rather dis@@ gu@@ ed like a Bu@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really has been inj@@ ured .
&quot; when I was eleven I was told me the children , I would look like a bug . &quot;
&quot; I felt really attacked , fri@@ ght@@ ened and embarrass@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; now I show me back and think me : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
especially the public they don &apos;t like to feel her love @-@ life : &quot; people expect you in a certain way and the anno@@ ying me .
&quot; and maybe some call me to be un@@ think@@ able , but I don &apos;t like to justi@@ fy myself before the whole public . &quot;
govern@@ or of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic govern@@ or of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thurs@@ days at a demonstration with President Tru@@ mp , that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; said Govern@@ or Justice . &quot;
today I will tell you with many prayers and much re@@ thinking ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia I can no longer help if I am a democratic govern@@ or .
the manifestation broke into Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration for the re@@ public@@ ans , &quot; Justice . &quot;
as a trainer I would say that it is time to play a different game .
Mr. Tru@@ mp promised a HU@@ GE announcement before the West Virginia R@@ all@@ ye .
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice endor@@ sed not the democratic candi@@ d@@ atin Hill@@ ary Clinton . &quot;
Justice that was according to For@@ bes the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state was elected .
&quot; For@@ bes presents that he owns carbon into five states , and inher@@ ited from his father a carbon shop . &quot;
it is worth 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee on Thurs@@ day@@ evening gave an explanation in which it said : &quot; &quot; the Party change of Govern@@ or Justice is another blow to a democrati@@ cally party that would be more likely to work in order to make our country back great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 Govern@@ ments and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Govern@@ or Justice is only the final rejection of a party that is seen from above down without leadership , and is unable to find a positive , some degree of message , &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ President R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the CB@@ S News . &quot;
CO@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian exc@@ use for dop@@ ing @-@ sc@@ andal
&quot; the global leader of Athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , pra@@ ised on Thursday , what he described as an obvious exc@@ use from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal but he was not the moment for the country to be back in sports . &quot;
&quot; Russia &apos;s athle@@ tic leader D@@ mit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin , said during the I@@ A@@ AF Congress at the eve of the Athle@@ tics World Championship , that the exile of his country was correct and that he is determined to fight the Dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; he said , there were no p@@ ity for &quot; all athletes , those in competitions of gold and silver medals . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , the I@@ A@@ AF Congress for the maintenance of the pro@@ hibitions , which was negoti@@ ated in November 2015 , after a report by the world @-@ anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( W@@ ada ) hin@@ ts on state @-@ of @-@ Dop@@ ing in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said I@@ A@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ e the Repor@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; the entire Council and the entire convention were delighted that the Russian Federation has realized at itself , that she has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation becomes new . &quot;
&quot; CO@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; pleased &quot; &quot; that Russia will accept the criteria for its re @-@ launch . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think that progress has been made , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot;
&quot; the principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the missed system , &quot; he added
ninth Russian Ath@@ l@@ eten are starting with the athle@@ tics world championship which will start Friday in London after the strict I@@ A@@ AF criteria as a neutral party .
&quot; the head of the I@@ A@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday , that Russia still satisfy some of the criteria for a re@@ setting . &quot;
&quot; standing tests are still in@@ adequate and bot@@ her@@ ed trainer are still free , he said repor@@ ters in London after a presentation at the I@@ A@@ AF Council . &quot;
Trau@@ mat@@ akt for in Mali tr@@ apped soldiers
at a grap@@ e party in the northern h@@ itz@@ ford Fr@@ itz@@ lar have thought about 1000 people of the two with a heli@@ cop@@ ters in Mali inter@@ rup@@ tive soldiers .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the Dom@@ etown at high safety arrangements .
&quot; to still un@@ clari@@ fied crash , Ursula von der Ley@@ en ( CD@@ U ) did nothing . &quot;
&quot; they called the two comments , but as &quot; &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of their specialist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we circum@@ cis@@ ed ourselves before this highest victim , which they did in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; said . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year Major and the 47 @-@ year Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen were on Wednesday before a week in the West African Mali .
their shar@@ pen@@ ge were transferred to Germany and accompanied by a Tot@@ ally @-@ guard of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er Dom San@@ kt Peter .
&quot; at the mid@@ day , only the relatives were in the church far@@ ewell . &quot;
&quot; after that , the grap@@ e party began in the circle of the family , eng@@ ster friends , from representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics . &quot;
below were also H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general spec@@ ter of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
grap@@ erg@@ ers laid the ro@@ ses , the relatives were standing arm in his arm to the waves . &quot;
in front of the church Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen .
&quot; Defence Minister of the Ley@@ en describes the &quot; &quot; commented soldier as &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; and imprison@@ ed . &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann had built the flight operation of the battle @-@ level tiger in Fr@@ itz@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger Pil@@ ots of his reg@@ im@@ ent .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , Com@@ man@@ de@@ ur of the reg@@ im@@ ent who belong to the soldiers , stated : &quot; if this crew could not turn the crash , then it could not have dec@@ ei@@ ved . &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali showed minist@@ ered by the Ley@@ en not : the use is dangerous .
&quot; but he was also of high significance &quot; for a country , from which we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
after the dream party the S@@ är@@ ge were brought out of the cathedral .
&quot; when and where to be re@@ funded , the Bundes@@ wehr made no details . &quot;
Prin@@ z Hen@@ rik wants no grave next to his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be pun@@ ished after his death next to his wife . &quot;
this shared the Royal House on Thursday with .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish König@@ sp@@ aar is set in the church of Ros@@ kil@@ de . &quot;
the sculp@@ tor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ gaard put already a coff@@ in for the two .
&quot; the queen was agreed with the decision of her husband , it did continue to be in communication . &quot;
where Prin@@ z Hen@@ rik will be buried was still un@@ clear .
but he did not have the intention to teach in his French homeland .
Prin@@ z Hen@@ rik never made a touch of it that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the , in 1972 he would be like to become king . &quot;
2016 he went to retirement and also places the title &quot; princ@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; because Hen@@ rik in Denmark do not have the title and the function he wanted , he do not see himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death , he explained Ball@@ eby , the chief &apos;s chief king &apos;s house . &quot;
&quot; where the last glory of the 83 @-@ year @-@ year , it will ultimately be un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; but he did not have the intention to be set in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country for which he has worked for over the last 50 years .
&quot; the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French arist@@ ocr@@ acy , was met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot;
at the Th@@ ames he worked in the French emb@@ assy .
during his later woman the sympath@@ etic of the people always fle@@ w , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his almost 50 years old reg@@ ained . &quot;
&quot; in a auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival was all that I did . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was flo@@ ating , I preferred wine instead of beer , soap , instead of Stri@@ ck@@ so@@ cks , Citro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smo@@ ked in place of Virginia @-@ tobacco , and those who had the reputation of being the brand of soci@@ alistic int@@ ellec@@ tu@@ als , I could not hope to hope . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not to be ash@@ amed .
these were two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants rapid re@@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP most of the possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; low @-@ informed Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , according to the loss of red @-@ green reg@@ ression for a swift re @-@ election of the country , but does not want to come back . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; because he spoke on Friday for the resolution of the parliament . &quot;
&quot; before , the surprising moment of a Green ME@@ P had joined the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SD@@ P ) in the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SD@@ P ) in a difficult crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official date of the country &apos;s election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hannover thus lost its scar@@ ce a majority vote in the Parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the previous Gre@@ ens El@@ ke El@@ ke wa@@ ist@@ ed her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for choosing 2018 in their constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ m@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she stated on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
CD@@ U @-@ Fra@@ del@@ sch@@ ef Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ um@@ ler wants to recommend its fac@@ tion to record them .
&quot; with this , CD@@ U and F@@ DP would have 69 seats in the Dutch Land@@ mark , SPD and green 68 seats . &quot;
so far the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag will be elected on 14 January coming year .
&quot; Com@@ promis@@ ers said , the red @-@ green state government now decide whether in this situation without a majority . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l considers it to be indispensable , that the country &apos;s day goes as quickly as its self @-@ rede@@ mption . &quot;
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on Tuesday through its further action .
&quot; the state version also sees the opportunity that the country &apos;s prime minister sends the trust , and elect a successor . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; our constitution provides several options . &quot;
&quot; these options must be legally tested , &quot; said Th@@ um@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; one will answer all questions in peace , if legally reasonable . &quot;
Th@@ um@@ ler called T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; but a little cur@@ ed .
the politicians themselves said : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she turned out to be a gr@@ ist of black green .
the Gre@@ ens demanded the tr@@ ash @-@ level sub@@ ordin@@ ate to the return of their land farm .
&quot; we of course assume that they received their land farm , which she has received over the green state of land , with immediate effect , shared the state of Meta J@@ ans@@ sen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; the Group president of the Green Anja P@@ iel said , &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ ilt . &quot;
&quot; they have deliber@@ ately decided , no pron@@ unci@@ ation in the fac@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; even in the background that there were no content differences , we cannot compre@@ h@@ end this step . &quot;
SPD @-@ ch@@ anc@@ ellor Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the crossing of the Dutch Green ME@@ P El@@ ke T@@ west to the CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; the behaviour of the former Gre@@ ens Members in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters and voters , but also the Council of Red @-@ Green , &quot; wrote the federal chief of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
&quot; he support the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , to let the country move quickly new . &quot;
the Australian T@@ west@@ ens cost Red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; the politicians &quot; &quot; in their last van@@ ity , and in their fr@@ ust its personal interests before the welfare of the country , cri@@ tici@@ zed SPD @-@ Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation . &quot;
it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony of this dirty inspir@@ es and tries to beat out of its political capital .

&quot; agricultural sh@@ ist@@ ers in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from Gi@@ f@@ aux , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany disc@@ usses about se@@ ated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can the consumer protect themselves .
Land@@ mer@@ sm@@ in@@ ister Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is given in an interview with the Edi@@ tors network Germany ( R@@ N@@ D ) .
Mr. Schmidt , How can the consumer protect itself from po@@ ison@@ ed eggs ? &quot;
I can only encourage all consumer inside and consumers to check out the eggs in your fridge and check the foot@@ print .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal , www.@@ grocery stores the Bundes@@ länder represent the latest information on the affected eggs . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if after all we know , a health haz@@ ard practically is excluded . &quot;
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis campaign - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier of the Bundes@@ land@@ in@@ ister is not really perceived ?
the food surveillance is the task of the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has immediately checked out and is located since announcements of Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available for the consumer .
&quot; trade has just as much as the manufacturers to worry about it , that the products sold is un@@ think@@ able and health@@ ful un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; if at eggs , the back @-@ length of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exc@@ eeded , these are not wrong . &quot;
un@@ load eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time is not the agrituris@@ mi to blame .
sitting production companies and consumers in the same boat ?
after the initial knowledge the production sites meets no immediate fault .
&quot; rather , they need to be due to mut@@ ually exclusive practices of service companies with economic damages . &quot;
as always there is in the harvest too little cont@@ rol@@ le@@ ure .
is it only available on the staff or in a conclusi@@ ve jurisdiction ?
&quot; however , there were just the official controls that covers the process . &quot;
&quot; however , the truth also belongs to that food fraud and criminal energy will never be eliminated to 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; this is why a consistent clari@@ fication of such events and the hand@@ over to the pro@@ secution in the cases , in which crimes can be made , of decisive importance . &quot;
I have already seen several times a lot of times that I am expecting a complete clari@@ fication of the competent authorities .
is the regular al@@ ar@@ mis@@ m for food sk@@ ies really necessary ?
Consumer protection and consumers have the right to get solely safe and wrong food .
&quot; if a non @-@ approved ins@@ oth@@ s in the food sector is used , consumer inside and consumers are right . &quot;
&quot; by the bre@@ wer@@ ed resources are manufacturer , dealers and consumers in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear : the un@@ law@@ ful use of insec@@ tici@@ des fi@@ pr@@ ing in the attitude of food supplies and must be termin@@ ated immediately . &quot;
it must be consistent with high pressure on all levels .
I expect from all the competent authorities that the atomic facts is soon clear@@ ed and am@@ us@@ eless .
how to have the financial rules of football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
&quot; the rules that aim to prevent un@@ ob@@ struc@@ ted issues of the European football fans , N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord @-@ transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain do not distur@@ b . &quot;
&quot; any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEF@@ A , as the leading organization that sur@@ vey@@ ed the European game , cre@@ ws from access to the pres@@ tig@@ est Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair @-@ Play rules , which were launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A to life , means that at some point has to point out that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar without major losses was funded . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 222 million Euros ( 262 million $ ) to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a sal@@ ary that will amount ten million dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
&quot; in case of security can make money lo@@ cker to make N@@ ey@@ mar , and bring him into a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team through the energy of rich mist@@ ress family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; associations are allowed to take a lot of money for purchasing players much money , but must be stock@@ ed with legi@@ timate income sources , which allow them to enable the Bre@@ ak @-@ E@@ ven point in their way to the football @-@ related business . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini at his election to the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
&quot; the former French player believed that associations in their quest for success had taken enormous debt to become effective , effectively g@@ rie@@ ve and ris@@ ked to ru@@ in , if banks or owners with@@ drawn their support . &quot;
FF@@ P shi@@ fted FF@@ P from concentration on debts of the clubs for the monitoring of their losses .
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the novel A@@ br@@ amo@@ vi@@ ch was originally used in Chelsea - a club with potential and then power@@ fully invested to establish the team and become a t@@ oug@@ her aff@@ air . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P pre@@ disposition that runs until 2018 , you can accept losses in the amount of 30 million euros . &quot;
&quot; and although plat@@ ini fallen from the pres@@ idency in Un@@ mer@@ ade , his UEF@@ A @-@ successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to desc@@ end for it , from excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; certainly , FF@@ P is not dead and we will certainly further strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so that is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week . &quot;
&quot; although the PSG paid the buy @-@ out cl@@ ause by N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing on the duration of his contract . &quot;
N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five @-@ year treaty so that the bott@@ oms for the next five years can be exp@@ elled from 4@@ 4.7 million in the annual financial statements .
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit the PSG along with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PSG obtained a money penalty of 60 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which later was reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the teams were limited for the Champions League of season 2014 / 15 to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players . &quot;
&quot; the UEF@@ A is in search of clubs which could try to over@@ list their financial perspectives by connecting their revenue by companies , which are linked to the owners of a club . &quot;
&quot; while a Catalan company could tran@@ sp@@ ose the PSG if the value of the sponsorship rates should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be considered legi@@ timate income . &quot;
&quot; this happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the sponsor of the P@@ SA was opened by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
it has been reported that some of the PSG payments to N@@ ey@@ mar on payments of the Organiz@@ ing Committee of the World Cup 2006 in Qatar .
but PSG and Qatar have disp@@ uted that N@@ ey@@ mar Cup amb@@ assador will be easy to find out and such a man@@ eu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regulatory authorities .
&quot; the previous sanctions against PSG means that the UEF@@ A will still be attentive , every attempt to observe the rules . &quot;
the UEF@@ A had no pre@@ fabric@@ ated conversation with PSG over N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , sag@@ tem on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
&quot; they said , under the condition of an@@ onym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation . &quot;
&quot; the last published reports are showing that in 2015 / 16 , with a turnover of 54@@ 2,@@ 4 million euros have achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros . &quot;
the accounts for the last fiscal year must be published .
PSG is expected that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrived a blessing for sponsorship De@@ als , merch@@ an@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ m sales . &quot;
the association assumes that sales after signing at least 30 per cent will rise .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly ir@@ ri@@ fied to see one of the best football players to see , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s to prevent it that I could hurt the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of the La League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS with regards to Kat@@ ar &apos;s last owner . &quot;
&quot; ar@@ sen@@ al manager Arsen@@ e W@@ enger , whose association is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , the reservations made by La Liga against a state that financed an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the owner and this has changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; said W@@ enger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it is very difficult to respect the Financial Fair@@ play , because you can have different ways or have different interests , if a country has such a great player to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is searching for a new chim@@ ney
in recent years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y Bord made chocolate for Swiss Swiss .
&quot; now , the standing cooperation in front of a possible end : the airline is writing new . &quot;
Swiss @-@ speaking at Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ eck confirmed a corresponding report from the magazine &quot; Nord@@ west@@ .html &quot; from Friday .
&quot; according to current planning , the Air@@ line will take a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products would have checked every two to three years and subj@@ ected to a quality control .
&quot; with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; said the Spre@@ ader . &quot;
around 17 million small red @-@ white sh@@ og@@ g@@ it@@ les down to 14 grams per year the flight atten@@ d@@ ant in front of the landing to the passengers .
about the costs the Swiss does not want to make any details .
&quot; industry cross @-@ border , the volumes of according to EUR 1.5 to 2 million Swiss fran@@ cs - the mig@@ ros @-@ daughter achiev@@ es an annual turnover of approximately one billion Swiss fran@@ cs . &quot;
but more important is all@@ em@@ al of the adver@@ t effect : for a p@@ og@@ gi@@ ver it is a pres@@ ci@@ ous order .
&quot; as many applic@@ ants are at the new tender , the Swiss will not want to betra@@ y . &quot;
but there are only Swiss manufacturers .
&quot; according to the time @-@ report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y will make efforts to renewal of the Treaty on Spring 2018 . &quot;
for S@@ DA was the biggest Swiss Cho@@ colate manufacturer not accessible for an opinion .
chocolate boards spread the Swiss since 2006 on board of their flights .
&quot; before the Swiss contract concluded a contract with the mig@@ ros daughter , Barry Call@@ eb@@ aut had delivered in collaboration with H@@ ug the chocolate tablets . &quot;
&quot; the opportunity to place the logo , Swiss before two and a half years ago , with the start of cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;

nostal@@ gia goes in &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; in the N@@ ic
&quot; this repeti@@ tion of history is the same time nostal@@ g@@ ically because of the glorious days of the characters of 80 @-@ s , for the 90 @-@ er @-@ Gr@@ unge era ( as the Vor@@ den@@ ker David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ er the Sk@@ etch @-@ Com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV dre@@ ams ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d went to bigger things . &quot;
as a cultural arti@@ st@@ act it is equally a par@@ ody and an em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era permanent memories .
but as Fran@@ chise feels like the time would just make .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly good , not just because of its absur@@ d lob@@ ors ( there is a original story for a speaking D@@ ose vegetable , which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by elimin@@ ating themselves at the core of the day - actor middle age play vacc@@ ination children , who will grow - they still managed to gain the im@@ possibility of winning the last part of the jok@@ es . &quot;
&quot; ten Years later , &quot; with his adults , who now play adults , is less emoti@@ onally @-@ root@@ ed and its par@@ ody goes more after the casting principle , including a re@@ ff at the Stal@@ ker @-@ Films of the 90 @-@ er years as &quot; The Hand , Rocks the cra@@ dle &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; at a point du@@ ll a character through an Apple @-@ Power@@ Book , some in@@ line sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from the year 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the gr@@ acious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ ians , has K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) still not forgotten . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has not yet lost its vir@@ g@@ inity .
&quot; and there is another crazy @-@ mal@@ ign@@ ant p@@ lot , in the Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Sch@@ alter ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well received impression of Michael Ian Black ) . &quot;
as always the EX@@ K@@ UR@@ SE is the best part of fran@@ chise .
&quot; it makes especially great fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rud@@ d , the Matt D@@ ill@@ ons Unter@@ li@@ ppen@@ che of &quot; Sing@@ les &quot; indicates , whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy is now feels like an old boy . &quot;
&quot; there are the moments of acci@@ dental mad@@ ness that could reach this fran@@ chise , like a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he will show what I will show as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years later &quot; , &quot; the last scene will show the Ban@@ de &apos;s Hot American Summer &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; at Amazon re@@ members another kind of nostal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War by &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Blon@@ de &quot; and even at &quot; G@@ low &quot; with his East @-@ against @-@ West Ring@@ battle @-@ I@@ kon@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; the comedy by Brian Gat@@ ewood and Alessandro tan@@ aka made comedy with Rh@@ ys Thomas as director , a Fo@@ al drama of the 1980s with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marx@@ ism @-@ Lenin@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; the main rolls - a hard @-@ born Greg@@ or and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic j@@ r and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alog@@ s of ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an extensive producer ) and Joseph Gord@@ on @-@ Lev@@ itt . &quot;
it is a geni@@ us idea .

there are some nice g@@ ags for watching ( the police sp@@ ends the time to watch chess on TV how American it might do with football ) .
&quot; and the list of the famous speakers - including Jenny S@@ late , Nick offer@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ oms Sev@@ ign@@ y - ensures a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de the voice . &quot;
&quot; but &quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is very committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a des@@ perate propaganda gland - a mur@@ derer who carries a re@@ ag@@ an m@@ ask is included - that it is often like a single .
&quot; in six long episodes , it moves , and the comedy is not fast or often enough . &quot;
&quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; , &quot; which has been arranged on a lower length of credit , because Greg@@ or and I@@ os@@ ef always visit the American message , whose lobby is always occupied by two dense males who has come a p@@ ile Hamburg . &quot;
the message for the imag@@ inary communist audience is that Western culture can make everything to feed for a money .
the fic@@ tive Romanian cre@@ ators are not wrong : we even make it even with our own younger story and with thei@@ rs .
blow against drugs @-@ m@@ ia in the country
police is a blow against the Italian Maf@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , in the Black Forest @-@ B@@ aar district , in Rot@@ t@@ because , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart numerous objects over@@ looks like the prosec@@ ut@@ or Con@@ stance on Friday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; at the age of 25 years , 15 def@@ ects were arrested in the age of 25 and 77 years and are already warran@@ ted against this . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the officials called large quantities of mari@@ juana and Kok@@ ain , fire@@ arms as well as several hundreds of thousands . &quot;
two people were arrested in the same raid in Italy .
against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans there was German ar@@ rest warran@@ t .
the two are therefore probably delivered to Germany .
in the action Italian and Bayer@@ ische Construc@@ tors were involved .
&quot; in total , more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Maf@@ ia will be organised crime crime , serious impacts , murder , as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and ex@@ tor@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; since summer 2016 , the Public Pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ or Con@@ stance against organised drug stores in the South German space . &quot;
&quot; between the pro@@ secution in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo , an re@@ ger exchange and the medi@@ ator of the kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ because had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the big use on wed@@ n@@ och@@ tomorrow was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo . &quot;
&quot; into the Vis@@ or of investigations , especially Italian national citi@@ zenship primarily with regards to the Italian Maf@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; also an inci@@ dent on 27 May in hat@@ s , at the early morning several shots were ab@@ ed into a guest house , likely to go to the account of the Ban@@ de . &quot;
and charged large g@@ aps in the foreig@@ ners @-@ register
data of citizens that should not arise as yet : a report also indicates the foreig@@ ners in Germany to have significant short@@ com@@ ings .
the lead to partly engra@@ ving fail@@ ures for asylum procedures .
&quot; the en@@ voy for the refu@@ gee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Way , has been made aware of a media report on big g@@ aps in the de@@ centr@@ alist register . &quot;
&quot; short@@ com@@ ings in the registered data could lead in asylum procedures and deport@@ ations &quot; to be partly engra@@ ved failure , in an analysis that is the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the register , the information is estimated 10 million people with foreign nation@@ alities , including about 5,@@ 7 million out of non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
the data will be managed by about 600 foreig@@ ners in Germany .
&quot; because the data have not been adequ@@ ately maintained , be the data quality in parts so far has not been good . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; of people who have long been no longer in life , or by citizens who have become German citizens , and in the tab no longer should arise . &quot;
faul@@ ty dat@@ ashe@@ ets can slow@@ down greatly slow@@ down , the report is still further . &quot;
&quot; in statistics concerning char@@ geable people , all over the EU citizens must not have to travel . &quot;
&quot; but such a false post@@ ings , however , led to a dist@@ or@@ ating debate on dealing with pay@@ out , &quot; says it therefore in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the federal government obviously has begun to send refu@@ gee families with under 16 @-@ year children back to Italy when they are submitted by there . &quot;
&quot; this is based on an internal paper of the Bundes@@ am@@ ts for Migration and refugees ( BAM@@ F ) , the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ reg@@ er Newspaper . &quot;
&quot; in the paper it is accordingly , the BAM@@ F lead such procedures for families with children - except for inf@@ ants and small children - according to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation on site . &quot;
&quot; according to the Dublin , it is responsible for refugees from the EU state , which they first achieve . &quot;
&quot; if a mig@@ rant is continuing to another EU country , this state can send him back to the entry . &quot;
&quot; for justi@@ fication the office is now : &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the reception capacity for families with minor children in Italy significantly increased . &quot;
Italy provided for admission and accomodation of Family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ rt@@ HR ) keep this promise for adequate .
&quot; in addition , other EU states would also return to refugees within the Dublin Convention . &quot;
&quot; the interior political speaker in the Bundestag in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ g@@ ke , cri@@ tici@@ zed this decision : &quot; families with children , because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system human rights , and an haz@@ ard of the child . &quot;
two @-@ plates result
a total of 220 liter blood of in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach living people were already provided for other people .
&quot; at least by the twelve citizens who have been awarded on Friday . &quot;
&quot; thanks to all the Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who now divided up to 50 lit@@ re of blood in the meantime . &quot;
&quot; traditionally hon@@ oured the church in the meeting of the municipal council , the multip@@ lied read@@ iness to don@@ ate blood . &quot;
&quot; it is geni@@ us how our body is laid out and we z@@ ol@@ len the sp@@ en@@ ders respect which their blood for stran@@ gers are available , nor un@@ anim@@ ous , under@@ lined Mayor Karl@@ hein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood test helps several people , &quot; explained the round@@ about of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ C ) , Hol@@ ger Ma@@ is@@ enb@@ acher , because the Con@@ ser@@ ven are cr@@ ush@@ ed into their constitu@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; thus , three people could benefit from a blood@@ stream . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Ma@@ is@@ enb@@ acher reported from the promotions that will be performed in spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved with 114 columns the second best result , &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ C county conductor . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change to the theatre was conducted a higher number of years ago . &quot;
&quot; previously , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ le , Thomas Reich@@ le and Meta Um@@ gu@@ ards to the multi @-@ gym and were awarded for 50 hours of blood@@ stream . &quot;
&quot; half as many as Herbert M@@ air and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while T@@ amara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter 10 times each more than 500 milli@@ liter of their lifestyle . &quot;
the Bank of England will keep the interest rate at 0.@@ 25 %
&quot; the Bank of England is expected to be announced later , that the interest rates remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation the spec@@ ulations have pushed over a rise . &quot;
&quot; the Bank of England has war@@ ned that the economic growth &quot; &quot; income &quot; will remain , when they set the interest rates on family courses in the middle of an increased pressure . &quot;
&quot; the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 , the interest rates of 0,@@ 25 % , whereas in this month less members will rise up a rise , since the weak economic growth has increased the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quar@@ terly inflation , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1,@@ 7 % and for 2018 at 1,6 % and war@@ ned that the pressure on the household income would continue to continue at almost 3 % . &quot;
&quot; but they sign@@ alized that in the next few years of tick @-@ caves , they would like to grow from Bre@@ x@@ it , and she said that the credit cost may have to rise more than expected at the financial markets . &quot;
the members also agreed to withdraw part of the Mamm@@ ut con@@ j@@ unc@@ tural package that was issued before one year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
&quot; it will demand time for financial investments in order to provide financial resources for banks , though said that it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds of Ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; minutes after deciding on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central progn@@ osis of the M@@ PC remains weak ( GDP ) , since pressure on the real income of households continue to load consumption . &quot;
&quot; in interest rates it repe@@ ats that &quot; &quot; a certain sent@@ encing of monetary policy &quot; &quot; is required for cooling of inflation and a &quot; &quot; somewhat bigger &quot; scale than the markets . &quot;
the markets predic@@ t the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; the Bank stressed however , that increases &quot; gradu@@ al &quot; and &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the forec@@ ast@@ ed growth forecasts for this and next year are compared to the 1.9 % and 1.@@ 7 % .
it has retained its growth progn@@ osis to 1,8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages towards the dollar and the euro .
&quot; the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1,@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0,@@ 4 % to 1,@@ 11 Euro . &quot;
&quot; the decision to any change comes , after the recent dis@@ appoint@@ ing growth pay the rising expectations on a tick @-@ height and increased GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % . &quot;
&quot; growth is expected to be at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is easy to recover after the bank at the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the youn@@ gest report offered little enthusiasm for households that will be affected by a growing inflation and minor enh@@ ances since the tight@@ ening is still worse , before they will get better . &quot;
&quot; they added that monetary policy may not prevent the income change in the coming years , but they added that wages are projected at the end of their three @-@ year pre@@ dictions . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also enhanced by the rising demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pounds , which will compens@@ ate a part of lower consumption . &quot;
the decision arises a year after lo@@ wering the interest rates on 0.@@ 25 % last August after the shock@@ ing EU vote that condem@@ ned the sin@@ king of the paths .
the bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy .
&quot; prior to the last judgment of the Bank , the call has risen to the Z@@ ins@@ ile , since inflation was increasing pressure on hard households , whereas three political decision makers in July called for a rise to 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; inflation is dropped last month from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank said that this was expected and put it again in the coming months . &quot;
&quot; the Bank said , the adv@@ ancing in relation to their aim of 2 % is &quot; &quot; completely &quot; &quot; to the weak pounds . &quot;
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; given the short@@ est back@@ rest of the s@@ wap arrangements , the mort@@ gage market should be more competitive again since the len@@ ders are looking forward to shops and end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market looks particularly good for those with the existing defic@@ ien@@ cies and the new mort@@ gage , and many with free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
NH@@ S ( The National Health Service ) is intended to write al HIV @-@ Dro@@ ge 10,000 people
patients are obtained from September after a fight against the High Court against financing of the drug in the NH@@ S access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV infection treatment .
&quot; NH@@ S England announced that one in front of the sexual intercourse proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) which can reduce the inf@@ ectious risk at around 86 percent , now from the health service over a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the process after having confirmed the appeal of the Court of Justice in the past year , the NH@@ S had the powers to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that local authorities should finance him . &quot;
&quot; the chess announced chess column was welcomed by NH@@ S England , Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention , &quot; during the National Aids trust ( NA@@ T ) this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bright@@ on , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be the first to follow the registration of people and further clinics are introduced in October 2018 , before it will be introduced in April 2018 . &quot;
predic@@ tive proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p reduce the HIV transmission of inf@@ ectious diseases .
pre@@ p prior to intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such drugs can be taken each day or so already two hours before the intercourse .
&quot; to those who come for the treatment in question , are pregnant or bis@@ exual men , tran@@ ss@@ exu@@ als and persons with HIV @-@ positive partners that were not successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; clinics are identified appropriate participants including the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status will not be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral treatment . &quot;
&quot; people who live in England and registered in a household doctor , can also opt @-@ in for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic . &quot;
the program will be £ 10 million and NH@@ S England signed a contract for delivery of medications into this week after an international competitive pro@@ curement .
&quot; the study aims to assess the entire potential of pre@@ p by using clinical Bel@@ ege , as it is used in a large scale , and is implemented . &quot;
&quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement the extensive and increasingly successful efforts to safeguard the prevention of HIV and over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
it is another milestone in the more than three decades lasting progress in addressing one of the biggest health challenges of hum@@ ank@@ ind . &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; &quot; this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , when it is targeted at vulnerable and je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed people , the possibility to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September to people with high HIV risk access to this NH@@ S @-@ funded attempt to develop new instrument that is really controlled individually and not with a negoti@@ ating with a partner is subject to what to improve many , many lives . &quot;
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority now has to be done in the whole country and that no one who has left a risk for HIV . &quot;
&quot; now since the pre@@ p @-@ test medicine was created , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infection . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Hod@@ g@@ son , Schatten @-@ Health Minister , said : &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is to be more months , delays and hes@@ itation implementation by the government and over@@ due . &quot;
the evidence show how transform@@ ative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transfer of these vital infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as fast as possible throughout the country to safeguard the HIV infected , and that they will contribute to promoting HIV in society . &quot;
life live : me@@ zz@@ an@@ ine and cle@@ ver@@ e designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court Apartment into a spacious home
&quot; Jo@@ anne L@@ eigh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , joined in 2014 from a large house in K@@ night@@ s@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court Apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed their po@@ ckets and sold .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex at K@@ night@@ s@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; I was looking for something , which was similar to my price . &quot;
this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court and she had the same high c@@ eil@@ ings .
I loved her in her and made an offer on this day .
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square @-@ foot was completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
originally a A @-@ bedroom property with an wast@@ ed layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne St@@ aur@@ aum and a me@@ zz@@ an@@ ine to make optimal use of the generous cover height .
&quot; I wanted high c@@ eil@@ ings , big windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; this was my requirement , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; to this end , she was the Archit@@ ect and Design@@ studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to make the 12,5 foot high c@@ eil@@ ings and create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the blan@@ ket was not big enough to place two rooms each other , so that the architectural challenge was to create a me@@ zz@@ an@@ ine in which one could stand . &quot;
&quot; Er@@ fan had to think , to solve the task . &quot;
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explained . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so arrange that they were over@@ thrown out , without having to g@@ aps us . &quot;
&quot; it was not just about to build a simple platform , but the steel so that he had the right height at the top or down the correct height . &quot;
&quot; this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan , two spaces in full height - with much extra drama . &quot;
for the me@@ zz@@ an@@ ine looks a classic copper window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us via the gl@@ amor@@ ous area .
&quot; the gold @-@ furniture , silver acc@@ ents , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge mou@@ ille lights put the style to the program . &quot;
the use of spi@@ der plays a role in addition to theatre , space and light . &quot;
on both En@@ den is a short cor@@ rid@@ or mir@@ r@@ ored to let him last longer .
in the kitchen the mirror feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance we offer units space for all bri@@ cks and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
&quot; due to the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
coll@@ ap@@ sible kit@@ chens are nothing new .
what is special about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineer went in , &quot; explained Er@@ fan of the steel reinforced , fur@@ ni@@ fied MD@@ F door . &quot;
&quot; it is too important , so that when you slide the door , very easily bal@@ ancing . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to win additional 16 m ² , an extra bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the basic space - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mental form will enter a real estate mak@@ ler , and carry out a calculation based on the bottom size . &quot;
here they have managed to enlarge the floor surface and at the same time high quality materials used to generate its luxurious advantage .
&quot; the materials are things that you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;

brothers fight for a 500 million US dollars
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ n@@ asty , in a dispute because of one of the biggest real estate standards A@@ ori@@ as in the value of more than 500 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developer Colin De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors of his younger brother Paul removed . he has brought him to the Supre@@ me Court to clarify how their property and their business . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp conflict on the separation takes place in the Supre@@ me Court of Justice . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna possess the brothers 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars , accum@@ ulated since the family in 1973 a shop at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; there the family West@@ co Je@@ ans founded , and grew up to a chain of 160 items . &quot;
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
&quot; this money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis comprises offices in the city center , the development area of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and M@@ t Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; following an agreement with her father &apos;s father , Colin - von Paul as a main operator and the domin@@ ating personality in the family De Lu@@ tis described - about two thirds of the enterprise , and Paul approximately one third . &quot;
a jurisdiction that this means that Colin are owned by 316 million dollars and Paul in the value of 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has been proven to Paul as a crime point .
&quot; the experts proposed by Colin proposed have left him with what I held for the best objects , he wrote in 2015 in a first Aff@@ id@@ av@@ it . &quot;
last Friday took place after several times the first hearing of the Supre@@ me Court of Justice .
the brothers now also fight for control of the existing business - from Colin as Paul claims to accept him .
&quot; it is not pat@@ ented , this is not true , but thro@@ ws Paul before , some pos@@ sessions in@@ compet@@ ently . &quot;
&quot; in an early aff@@ id@@ av@@ it , that was submitted by Colin , he says he hope to set the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage writes before , that the family is the most important priority . &quot;
&quot; the cost rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , em@@ ails and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and charter K@@ eck C@@ ram@@ er , and with leading lawyers , including All@@ an My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides of the owners . &quot;
Mrs De Lu@@ tis and her canc@@ eling husband were Italian immigrants who bought the dairy bars and delic@@ acy stores in the late 1950 @-@ years and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick .
&quot; they use the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , in the Colin the first je@@ ans@@ k of the family opened . &quot;
&quot; she said that he began West@@ co there , when he was in my last few years of high school , when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi who died in 2012 , who hop@@ ed their property to pass on their sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi often said to me , that he never wanted to land the brothers in court , &quot; she wrote them . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group , with Colin claims that Mark had paid for 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; Luke as well as Mark be , so Paul &quot; says about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
Colin has kept very back though he was a former AF@@ L pre @-@ board and after a biography from 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of television stars .
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Colin and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their law@@ yer .
&quot; only Colin answered by SMS to say &quot; I can really not say much , &quot; because the case before the dishes . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul has decided to complain and move to our family name by the courts . &quot;
&quot; in mid 2016 , Colin in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother . &quot;
&quot; our father would not have deliber@@ ate that Paul and I would like to end in our current dispute , &quot; he said and added that he still hope for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our aff@@ air will be solved in the near future by the courts , &quot; &quot; wrote Colin . &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s of new Stab@@ sch@@ ef is planning to limit the media @-@ st@@ in@@ ence of the president .
others have tried and have failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico reported that the new Stab@@ sch@@ ef of the White House is planning to limit the information flow on President Tru@@ mp - including the reports of the news media - in hope , the chef at an equal course . &quot;
here is a piece of repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Stab@@ sch@@ ef of the White House , at his first working day with leading staff , he set a main problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s white house , which he fixed : bad information that enter into the hands of the president . &quot;
&quot; Kelly said the staff , that information about him should flow through on paper or in brief@@ ing - because the President would make better choices if he would receive good information . &quot;
&quot; cell@@ aneous diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to hin@@ ge Tru@@ mp by monitoring its media advis@@ es . &quot;
&quot; President Tru@@ mp@@ s relationship with television dates back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV broad@@ casts is still strong . &quot;
&quot; if Candi@@ mp was exp@@ elled Tru@@ mp because of an unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he had been a fair reporting of jobs that were to convince him , &quot; said the former campaign consultant Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February towards the Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key , tru@@ mp &apos;s Twitter habit has been under control , according to six former election campaign , to ensure that his personal media sum includes a ste@@ aling praise . &quot;
okay .
&quot; but the idea that Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter habit has ever been &quot; under control , &quot; is ridi@@ cul@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; maybe these cre@@ ators know something , which we do not know others - that Tru@@ mp@@ s Twe@@ ets without their interventions were not yet more ignition . &quot;
we will probably never experience something about the twe@@ ets which the Tru@@ mp has not sent .
&quot; when his employee managed to cling to him some times , anger of him , then their efforts have been worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; but no one has consistently preventing it , that Tru@@ mp are prot@@ ested . &quot;
&quot; a part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of comp@@ eting parties , always try to advance their own agenda by promoting Tru@@ mp material that promotes their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico - quite busy with this story - reported in May on the preference of consultants , the President of strategic reasons to introduce und@@ eni@@ ous information . &quot;
this was an example that was described by Repor@@ ter Gold Gold@@ maker :
&quot; current and former Tru@@ mp @-@ officials say that Tru@@ mp is able to react to a negative press sections , especially such with cor@@ rid@@ ing le@@ ague , and that he is going to dec@@ ei@@ ved it out where they come from . &quot;
&quot; this happened at the end of February , when someone had a printed copy of a article by Got@@ New@@ s.com , the website of the Internet @-@ Prov@@ ocation , Charles C. Johnson , the source behind a p@@ ile to be of Lec@@ ks &apos; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson said because of Sch@@ ik@@ anen permanently from Twitter or that he has no concrete evidence , or that he was vo@@ ic@@ ed in the past and re@@ vo@@ ic@@ ed them in the past . &quot;
Tru@@ mp read the article and started to ask employees about wal@@ sh .
&quot; he added that the then director Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , have tried to implement a system to manage and document the Tru@@ mp . &quot;
how has it worked ?
Kelly tries to do three months later .
&quot; perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his impul@@ si@@ ves self , and his consultants are still looking for influence . &quot;
these distinctive factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
Master @-@ search@@ ed de@@ cks get post by Euro@@ pol
&quot; as the address is unknown , the hir@@ ing of the population will pray and hope . &quot;
the police in all of Europe sends this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards to dangerous crime on the flight .
&quot; as the addresses of the search@@ ed con@@ dom@@ ini@@ ties are not known , they are hop@@ ed from the population and pray . &quot;
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the promotion that follows the &quot; EU Most W@@ anted &quot; Adv@@ ent@@ ance of the winter .
&quot; the experiences had shown that many whis@@ per@@ ing are hidden in the holiday , it was called Euro@@ pol . &quot;
I have put 21 post@@ cards for search@@ ed bre@@ akers from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 , it has been the website www.@@ um@@ ost@@ e , more than 2.5 million times has been viewed . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online fin@@ ders could have been determined so far , at least eleven of them due to hin@@ ts after publication on the website . &quot;
travelers negotiate on a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; milli@@ on@@ &apos; series &apos;
&quot; some of the most prosper@@ ous home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are again negoti@@ ated with some un@@ developed travelers on con@@ scientious obj@@ ections to withdraw from the congreg@@ ation , to call a field in front of their homes . &quot;
the travelers have named their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside of a prosper@@ ous road from Soli@@ h@@ ull that is called the &quot; milli@@ on@@ aires series . &quot;
&quot; they have brought back horses , babies and an army of tran@@ sports , after they were dropped only in May without being stretched out from one of the Council were excav@@ ated , to prevent their accidents . &quot;
the tac@@ tical group took a gap in the defense units and op@@ ted their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ ob@@ struc@@ ted to find a way .
&quot; angry residents have pushed the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , the said that it was &quot; us@@ eless to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous inhabitants said , &quot; &quot; They are de@@ duc@@ ted on the assembly of the evening , after they were sent from Bentley He@@ ath where they have thrown into the pas@@ sers . &quot;
the Council must be forced by shame to implement in fact since it was us@@ eless when dealing with the problem .
the travelers were moved in May there and are now back again .
&quot; more came yesterday evening , probably even more . &quot;
&quot; you added : &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by means long sub@@ missions to protect their parks . &quot;
&quot; I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy , continue to pay my community if the Council cannot even stop . &quot;
&quot; an attraction that would not be called , said : &quot; it &apos;s ridi@@ cul@@ ous , we just have seen the last round of these travelers , only to be pl@@ ain@@ ted from another round . &quot;
the numbers have increased this time and it has even seen a horse in the Park@@ zone .
&quot; speaking of Soli@@ h@@ ull Council said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of a un@@ authorized warehouse on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so as quickly as possible . &quot;
&quot; to support our Be@@ er collection , it is very important that as many assu@@ mp@@ tions can report a anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 . &quot;
&quot; this contributes to creating an image of the situation in which the court has to consider when we present our case . &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof is the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
&quot; the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts is currently being renovated and will be opened again on 1 March next year . &quot;
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closing of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof through the then ambi@@ ance operating company mbH , the 13th of April 2014 went lost over 30 000 nights per year and also revenue by tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in the autumn of 2014 , in view of dramatically rising numbers of refugees who arrived in the Land@@ marks , the hotel building to the land of land , as a collective agreement , which was used for contro@@ vers@@ y discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was at that time in the municipal council not un@@ disp@@ uted .
&quot; but above all , Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts Ober@@ bourgeois Julian O@@ SS@@ wald , defended the hotel location and already spoke at the time of serious stakeholders in the house . &quot;
he should keep right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with business leader Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of three @-@ star @-@ Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four homes with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object four houses .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ers and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; you are Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ is@@ en@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof has been in front of the entrance for a longer period of construction , and when one enters the house , it becomes clear , what extensive renov@@ ations will be carried out . &quot;
&quot; the so@@ ils have been extrac@@ ted , blan@@ kets to part with@@ constructed , old bath@@ t@@ ubs from the rooms . &quot;
the whole hotel building is a single construction site .
until March there is still much to do .
&quot; it is actually a lovely place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the black @-@ style style .
&quot; the rooms are furnished with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is trans@@ figur@@ ed , there will be new windows . &quot;
&quot; everything that later &quot; &quot; beautiful bourgeois close &quot; &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer express . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a jewelry piece off . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , spa area and a meeting room belong to the equipment . &quot;
&quot; you do not want to position at the high level of hotels in lu@@ ter@@ bath , but already on a up@@ scale downtown level , stres@@ ses Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms want to set up broad , are explained in the field . &quot;
&quot; both individual holiday@@ makers , groups or business@@ men are to feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
discussions with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism @-@ Director Michael Kr@@ ause he has already guided so shock .
the performances of the city are covered with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; after the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer will not want to be set exactly . &quot;
&quot; barely under one million euros , he expects . &quot;
&quot; the outside machines are brought to the front , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a patio there is a large terrace that is open to the restaurant , which is publicly available . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ aires : us @-@ Special @-@ Medi@@ ator sets Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia , President Donald Tru@@ mp was said to have a called Grand Jury in the Russia @-@ president Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; the Panel received the work in recent weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; in appeal to the cause of trust . &quot;
&quot; the paper analy@@ sed the step as a sign , that Mu@@ eller has been extended and intensi@@ fied . &quot;
the sender of CN@@ N reported it was the first pre @-@ lad@@ ders of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums in connection with a meeting between Tru@@ mp@@ s refriger@@ ant son and Russian law@@ yer .
US intelligence blame the Kre@@ m@@ lin to have been targeted in the presidential race for 2016 .
Mu@@ eller expl@@ ores whether there were the agreement between the Tru@@ mp@@ s election campaign and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of the investigations , several men are standing in the election campaign as a consultant of re@@ public@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; as a result , Mu@@ eller also took more and more Tru@@ mp@@ s private and business environment under the mag@@ ni@@ fier . &quot;
&quot; Washington Post , &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special medi@@ ator Tru@@ mp participated in the center , and sub@@ mis@@ ed whether the president has disabled the judi@@ ciary in the course of the aff@@ air . &quot;
&quot; the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to consider this evidence in potential conflicts , and decide whether indic@@ t@@ ment shall be raised . &quot;
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called counts .
&quot; mostly they are swit@@ ched on , when it is bigger and contro@@ vers@@ y cases . &quot;
the process is always behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be swit@@ ched by the prosec@@ ut@@ or &apos;s office to re@@ charge people under E@@ id .
&quot; according to the CN@@ N Sender CN@@ N , already issued pre @-@ lad@@ ders that turn around the encounter between Donald Tru@@ mp j@@ r. and a Russian law@@ yer . &quot;
individuals who were involved in the meeting were to be asked to be a statement named in this report .
&quot; in addition , they should provide documents . &quot;
&quot; besides Tru@@ mp j@@ r. also Tru@@ mp@@ s consultant and son @-@ in @-@ law Jar@@ ed K@@ ush@@ ner , as well as his election campaign , Paul Man@@ a@@ fort . &quot;
&quot; legal experts said on Thurs@@ day@@ evening in US TV , that the replacement show that Mu@@ eller shall not be in@@ tim@@ id@@ ated in his work and that he should be necessary to act quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , it may not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be swit@@ ched at the end to decide on the survey of an indic@@ t@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the replacement of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for President Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of new revel@@ ations , the President on Thurs@@ day@@ evening was given a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia aff@@ air as a campaign of his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the Russia @-@ History is a total in@@ vention , &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; the topic will give the democr@@ ats a possibility to feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about them . &quot;
&quot; his special consultant T@@ y Cob@@ b declared in an opinion , he know nothing of the composition of a Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; this work , but also usually in the secret , stressed he . &quot;
the White House supports all measures that acceler@@ ated the work of the special agent in a fair &quot; way .
the former F@@ BI @-@ Chef James Com@@ ey have said three times that will not be determined against the president .
&quot; you have no reason to accept that something changed , it was in the explanation . &quot;
&quot; but Mu@@ eller was only used , after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey had been over@@ priced . &quot;
&quot; because of this r@@ ashes were occur@@ ring against Tru@@ mp according to Tru@@ mp , he made the judi@@ ciary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June in front of a Sen@@ ate committee , Tru@@ mp brought him to be asked for a attitude of the en@@ quiries against the former national security consultant Michael Fl@@ ynn . &quot;
the president is under great pressure due to the investigation .
&quot; according to the account of U.S. media , the White House coll@@ ects the house material against the av@@ ators and its employees . &quot;
the proceeds spec@@ ulations from whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller release .
&quot; unlike in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate aff@@ irm@@ ation of Congress , like in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate aff@@ air by the later President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position , in which he could be theore@@ tically modified by the President of the Minister of Justice . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to explo@@ it such a step yet .
&quot; two groups of Republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators put on Thursday Leg@@ isl@@ ation before , after which the conduc@@ tors could no longer be released so easily . &quot;
Ant@@ arc@@ tic : gig@@ antic Eis@@ berg drives in the Ant@@ arc@@ tica
&quot; in the West Ant@@ arc@@ tic , a gig@@ antic Eis@@ berg has been solved by the nearly seven @-@ seven size of Berlin from the Schel@@ fei@@ s . &quot;
this shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener @-@ Institute for Polar@@ - and sea research on Wednesday .
&quot; over one billion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers large Kol@@ oss t@@ rei@@ be now to north and will probably need two , three years until he mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; he has been registered with 175 kilometers in length and a width of up to 50 kilometers one of the biggest ic@@ eberg that researchers have registered over the past three decades . &quot;
there is no danger to people out of him .
&quot; in the climate change , climate change has played a role in the break@@ down of the ice , is un@@ clear to research information . &quot;
&quot; however , there has been a series of unusual inter@@ rup@@ tions of ice cream in the region , writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fac@@ tual background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , that can be mer@@ ged with the heating up @-@ up . &quot;
the col@@ oss Kol@@ oss was so far from the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ fei@@ s .
Schel@@ celebrated swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ ac@@ iers .
it continues to grow up to the sea and breaks up regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ celeb@@ s is located south of South America almost at the top of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula .
north of this Schel@@ celeb@@ rates was the balance of wax@@ ing and break down a few years ago .
a complete Schel@@ celeb@@ s be there he writes AW@@ I @-@ researchers Daniela Jan@@ sen .
&quot; I am talking about it , that also the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ fei@@ s is in danger , because the pre @-@ dere can@@ te have never with@@ drawn as far as it is currently . &quot;
&quot; in addition stand the ice @-@ top of tension and can drop , if at a key@@ point a piece of mor@@ row . &quot;
&quot; the mel@@ ting of Schel@@ hor@@ s and Eis@@ berg increases the sea level not , as they swim on the water and hung on ice so much water as it gives after the mel@@ ting itself . &quot;
&quot; however , the loss of Schel@@ fei@@ ters leading the gl@@ acier directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the level , but only in a lower extent , writes the British research project to observe the Ant@@ arc@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ celeb@@ s is after AW@@ I information with nearly 50 000 square kilometres , the four &apos;s largest Schel@@ fei@@ s of Ant@@ arc@@ tica . &quot;
&quot; on the transfer from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , on the front @-@ edge to the free ocean around 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks up regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural happening and has no direct connection to climate change , the ice @-@ schild comes into a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ Le@@ ary from the British Sw@@ an@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; that is the far @-@ winning withdrawal from the beginning of the records , &quot; he confirmed . &quot;
&quot; among scientists be contro@@ versi@@ al whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ fei@@ s will now be back again or long in the long term , and possibly together , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; &quot; our models said that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
&quot; even though these researchers make the break@@ down of this gig@@ antic Eis@@ ber@@ gs did not lead to climate change , so many ic@@ eberg of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Pen@@ insula are destroyed . &quot;
this long apples the Ant@@ arc@@ tica covers the direction of South America .
according to data of the research programme British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Sur@@ vey is the Ice area of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula since the 19@@ 50s to 28 000 square kilometres .
&quot; to the decline , the temperature has contributed . &quot;
&quot; the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula have risen in the past 50 years by around three degrees , and there@@ with it to the areas where the temperature at the fastest . &quot;
CD@@ U aims at Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
&quot; because it is always harder to occupy free places , the CD@@ U calls for the employers to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; only shortly before the summer break , the circular saw 41 new jobs in the administration . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the Cre@@ ett@@ mann in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 tra@@ inees have got their first working day behind .
the teaching in the circle are obviously very talented .
around 620 applic@@ ants were to be found for the places in this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle is missing further personnel to cope with the growing requirements and tasks . &quot;
&quot; at present , there is still 50 not occupied by the circle M@@ ett@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; among other things , doctors and engineers , as well as the forces of the general administration . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to now take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG initiative and rel@@ ieve the skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; the administration is to develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development , according to the desire of the parties . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; aim is to cover not only short term demands on specialists , but future @-@ oriented of the applic@@ ants are opposite , &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should be based on inside and outside , concrete measures for cross @-@ clim@@ bers and contain a selection of initial @-@ based offen@@ sive , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
this already sounds like a good approach .
&quot; for the circle has it to do with a personal problem , which you had not previously knew . &quot;
other cities promote good officials and employees and offer more attractive terms .
the speech is given by a regular &quot; competition of public employers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a high number of employees , the disease or alter@@ ation of the service comes out of service . &quot;
&quot; so the highest time to action , so that not even more positions remain un@@ owned . &quot;
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter Peop@@ les , Fra@@ del@@ sch@@ ef of the CD@@ U , continues to go beyond the joint motion by his party . &quot;
he worked in@@ long already in the circle of a fine surprise for a fine surprise when he presented the personnel @-@ free public in question and the other parties stun@@ ned .
&quot; people want to be veri@@ fied that all possibilities will be veri@@ fied , which allow a withdrawal from the municipal employers . &quot;
&quot; if we are not in short notice of a satisfying solution , the Krei@@ dler should be cont@@ acted with the unions - perhaps also in collaboration with the circular towns - a Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f &quot; , &quot; so peoples . &quot;
&quot; thus , the CD@@ U , the staff and officials is trying to pay better than the collective bar@@ gain for the public service is actually visible . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently exactly pre @-@ written , enh@@ anc@@ ements or more money there is only when one changes into a higher level that is oriented towards career years . &quot;
&quot; however , the tasks of the circle are ever increasing over the past few years . &quot;
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which to take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitute law . &quot;
&quot; not least , by the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , Thomas Hen@@ del@@ e and Kreis@@ ler Martin judges have a problem : they have too little staff . &quot;
Italy intensi@@ fies the tone to NGO @-@ migrants @-@ lif@@ ebo@@ ots
&quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has NGOs to put the lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean Sea , war@@ ned that they may not continue to continue , if they are not in new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs have no new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue , &quot; said Interior Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Tur@@ iner Daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot;
&quot; Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities &apos; sei@@ zed by the Italian authorities a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; Youth R@@ ettet &apos; , because their team had worked effectively with human trafficking in a manner that facilit@@ ated the illegal immigration . &quot;
&quot; the aid organisation , which has only been in operation since a year ago , it has been down to the exec@@ utions of the Italian State of Amb@@ ro@@ gio Cart@@ osi@@ o . &quot;

&quot; at least one such a co@@ incidence not only found 1,3 miles in front of the Liby@@ an coast , according to the nu@@ des of the government , whose content of Italian media has been published . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is susp@@ ected , over the authority of the Italian coast , the lif@@ iers in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not monitored from any other moti@@ fs . &quot;
under the Code of Con@@ duct you need to have boats like the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta especially on board a Italian police force on board that sur@@ vey@@ ed their activities .
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and bail@@ out sets , have so far been declared to keep up the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday , that the new rules would be considered un@@ necessary , but acceptable , as they would not bring &quot; significant changes or ob@@ struc@@ tions &quot; of their lif@@ ecy@@ cle actions . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel laur@@ e@@ ates @-@ organization doctors without borders ( M@@ SF ) . &quot;

&quot; during the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; he gave plans for further talks with Liby@@ an citizens in this month about economic development initiatives , and with them , Niger , and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who can leave these countries in hope , Europe can reach Europe . &quot;
An@@ sti@@ le and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine hamlet of bi@@ ker , the &quot; Berliner Ou@@ ter &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ enheim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz region , to enjoy four days of tri@@ angles and sights . &quot;
three fir@@ sth@@ and guides were available .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ s@@ ei@@ mer valley proved to be a good starting point for tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
&quot; the first tour led to hot summer temperature , along the vineyards to the Michael@@ sk@@ ap@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim . &quot;
&quot; followed view@@ points , partly in towers , from which one could look far beyond the paths of forests and the front levels . &quot;
&quot; between there was always a long period of an@@ sti@@ ts , for the long tri@@ ples . &quot;
on the second day there went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim on the Sal@@ ine and the People &apos;s Festival .

console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga ge@@ ars for e @-@ sport
are the Sport @-@ Stars in future ahead of computer @-@ soles instead of struggling with wind and weather over the stadium
&quot; fact : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious industry , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - great stars , millions fans and huge tournaments included with high gifts . &quot;
this also recognized the first Bundes@@ lig@@ aver@@ a who are increasingly involved in this area .
&quot; in the beginning of 2015 the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later followed the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , the middle of July an e @-@ sports department founded and two pro@@ s for the computer game 2010 . &quot;
&quot; we hope to attract the whole new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says Executive Board of Jo@@ chen Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; he is sure , that on this train still will rise . &quot;
&quot; the coming weekend organized the football @-@ World Association of FIFA in London the first &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; , &quot; in which the Gam@@ er of different clubs will compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; besides Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven quali@@ fies . &quot;
also Robin Dut@@ t sees big potential in the E @-@ Sport .
the ex @-@ coach of Bayer L@@ ever@@ k@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen are now advis@@ es an agency for virtual football player .
&quot; the real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ old , that young people also have to go into the stadium , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs tried , all possible markets , especially the Asian , to conqu@@ er . &quot;
&quot; with prominent e@@ agle sports@@ men under contract , one could be more far more often on these markets than once in the year the Bundes@@ lig@@ am@@ ann@@ um to Asia . &quot;
what is it exactly ?
&quot; when e @-@ sport will be computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends &quot; , &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Counter@@ strike &quot; or even the football simulation of FIFA on competition level . &quot;
&quot; long ago , as in normal sport also , le@@ agues , in which the pro@@ s join with each other . &quot;
&quot; and with the Asian , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program . &quot;
but is it all about a proper sport ?
for many is the idea certainly wax@@ ed need@@ y .
also In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ber has long been on the question to deal with the question .
&quot; for the professor at the German Spor@@ ts@@ ch@@ schule in Cologne is e @-@ sport a sport because he is com@@ pressed and many biological and physical reactions show that one can also find in classical sport - for example , increased heart rate , stress actions , hormon@@ al changes . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it need cogni@@ tive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast reaction capacity . &quot;
professional gam@@ er should not only exercise at the console but also exercise their body and pay attention to the diet .
&quot; the f@@ itte Player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; but also problems : &quot; &quot; Dop@@ ing is becoming more and more on a subject . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; checks are difficult at online play , and in the scene missing the structures of the classic sport . &quot;
&quot; positive , the scientists emphas@@ ises the high Integr@@ ative effect of the E @-@ Sports . &quot;
&quot; the players are international on the way , this is like a big global family , there is no intercultural shirt . &quot;
&quot; a study of the corporate consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte , and the Federal Association Inter@@ active Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) tells the e @-@ sport a rapid growth ahead . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 we have been implemented 50 million euros in 2016 , mainly about advertising , sponsorship and great tournaments . &quot;
in three years the turnover should be at 130 million .
&quot; against the almost € 2,@@ 4 billion euros in the Bundes@@ liga , this is little . &quot;
&quot; however , the e @-@ sport &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as Hand@@ ball , basketball or hockey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte @-@ consultants . &quot;
international are many countries already further .
great markets are Asia and the USA where ex @-@ basketball h@@ ooks Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez am US team nr@@ g e@@ Sports participate .
Hollywood actor Ashton Kut@@ cher investing in the e@@ Sport race workshop Uni@@ kr@@ n .
in Europe too much .
&quot; in an Norwegian School e @-@ sport , e @-@ sports as teach sf@@ ach , says F@@ rob@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; according to the Netherlands and in France , the Bundes@@ liga @-@ associations , according to Dut@@ t is now oblig@@ ated to set an e @-@ sport department . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany &quot; , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B Board of Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; only in nostal@@ gia to fall , and the old times to clear , is no longer sufficient . &quot;
&quot; to keep the tradition of the association , but the company at the same time al@@ ign the modern market at the same time . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digi@@ tis@@ ation world , &quot; also means Dut@@ t . &quot;
&quot; then you can &apos;t stick to it , that only in football everything remains as it was always . &quot;

&quot; Michelle Carter because of the lyrics , the Con@@ rad Ro@@ y for su@@ icide , sentenced ... &quot;
a woman from Massachusetts has been sentenced to two and a half years because she has encouraged their friend by texts and calls for su@@ icide .
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their conviction behind bars and five years were exposed to mal@@ nutrition . &quot;
Carter was condem@@ ned in June because of un@@ cas@@ ual killing of Con@@ rad Ro@@ y who took life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Ro@@ y said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is unknown .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free to appeal .
&quot; she was faced with a maximum of 20 years , but their legal rules argu@@ ed that both them and Mr Ro@@ y in a psychological disease . &quot;
&quot; in red pants and a cre@@ me@@ ed bl@@ use dres@@ sed , Carter as with t@@ ears in the eyes , with folded hands and after down @-@ looking eyes , when they were sentenced . &quot;
&quot; their actions have brought to Con@@ rad Ro@@ y , &quot; &quot; said the coup in the court . &quot;
she ended his life to make their own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility taken over , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has no rep@@ ent@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; but car@@ ters law@@ yer said , it is a &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that they are totally un@@ fortunate . &quot;
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz , however , he did not find that her &quot; age or matur@@ ity , or even their spiritual disease have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a prosec@@ ut@@ or read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Ro@@ y who said that there is no day , where I don &apos;t miss the loss of my beloved Son . &quot;
&quot; I want it to be proud of me and as I am going with everything . I try , despite all of my pain , which we will carry for etern@@ ity with us , for his sisters , there is it . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Ro@@ y , said that they will never be prosec@@ uted by knowledge , or would never be part of the wedding of their brother , or would be a a@@ unt for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer this only person to have , with which I was together with my birth every day , is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to put a legal precision waste because there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to commit to another , su@@ icide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Ro@@ y was found dead as Ro@@ y in 2014 from a carbon det@@ oxi@@ fication in a vehicle .
&quot; the case passed national attention to himself , after Car@@ ters text sets them , that she had encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; Hän@@ g you , spring of a building , inside you yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , she said in several messages that she had been sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the eyel@@ ids in front of his self @-@ su@@ icide , she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing what you need to do is the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter &apos;s attention was sought by the death of Ro@@ y and ord@@ ained them by some press of the case .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
&quot; among the few , the Carter defended , the Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , which was condem@@ ned in 2007 because of murder of her British room@@ mate in Italy before she was released two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learn from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua gave me to Audi Cup as cap@@ turing is no co@@ incidence .
FC Bayern tr@@ aut to the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner has a big season to - Extra motivation since not .
&quot; what was different on his place in the cabin , that saw Joshua Kim@@ my immediately , even if the extra piece was very small , very small . &quot;
&quot; but since far and wide on the second day of Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ m and also no Manuel Neu@@ er was to be seen , he made himself with him on his arm . &quot;
&quot; the coach has not announced it , &quot; told the Con@@ cur@@ fed Cup winner , after his first use as Bavaria @-@ captain . &quot;
&quot; good , the One would have been able to run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
but the signs of the coach could also suggest that .
&quot; not the eight years older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was in those of Jugend@@ spiel@@ haus , Deb@@ üt@@ i and straight from the holiday to choose professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f as a play leader . &quot;
&quot; su@@ gar@@ s , one is most distributed in those that one wants to play a lot that you want to keep on mood . &quot;
&quot; so who became au@@ ser@@ k@@ ors , the heritage of Lah@@ ms can compete , a small extra @-@ motivation can only be used well . &quot;
&quot; Kim@@ me confirmed : &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player : assume responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday flow@@ ed the 22 @-@ year @-@ old as mini @-@ Lah@@ m over the field .
&quot; right behind , this is now its position , the white B@@ reads on the arm did its exercise . &quot;
&quot; and at all , Kim@@ me in this start @-@ story like the one who can take the ru@@ der also in the hand . &quot;
&quot; he gave instructions , tried to channel the un@@ played tro@@ upe . &quot;
&quot; he had the view of the whole thing , while many others were busy with themselves . &quot;
&quot; Vi@@ dal with this , his missing fitness to over@@ play ( fol@@ ds hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches with it , to be sent to the achievements of Asia @-@ travel ( kl@@ app@@ te also only moder@@ ated ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le therefore , in their first appearance in the Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t . &quot;
this is all quite good .
&quot; Sü@@ le ran beside Kim@@ me , Rud@@ y before the resistance , both ag@@ greg@@ ated sou@@ ver@@ n . &quot;
the well @-@ occupied Nap@@ oli storm was often hard and tried to look at the game for a few times in the game .
&quot; his colleague Rud@@ y existed , that the result was not as much as we hope this hope . &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance at debut .
&quot; shi@@ fting , Temp@@ ow@@ ech@@ sel : &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; how unusual this Bavaria @-@ World is still available for the news , one looked at the game . &quot;
&quot; Rud@@ y for example , there was no one or two , but determines six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ me has made himself a few kn@@ uck@@ ed statements in the back of his new fellow @-@ player .
&quot; there he listen@@ ed to an interesting proposition : &quot; &quot; what is happening here , I now have noticed . &quot;
in Bavaria you just need to win any game . &quot;
&quot; after all , it is necessary to bring the new one to the new one . &quot;

company pleased with tor@@ land @-@ pf@@ alz Minister : economy lo@@ ur@@ ns Wis@@ s@@ ings Tempo
&quot; it was often re@@ conc@@ il@@ ably , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) nor Economic Affairs of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palatinate . &quot;
this shows itself after more than one year in which the new economic Minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V request from a change in economic policy - and simultaneously the old minister .
&quot; Frank N@@ atus , Chairman of the Association Tri@@ er Group ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing takes the wishes of the economy to the Lem@@ ke all@@ es@@ amt . &quot;
the largest turn@@ around N@@ atus is seen in the infra@@ structural policy : the lo@@ vel@@ ing of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and A@@ den@@ au is now in the primary list of the country above .
&quot; again this year , the ministry hopes on a plan@@ ing process until 2021 is supposed to stand the right @-@ genuine . &quot;
a role in the plans of the country is also playing the West@@ um@@ er Tri@@ er that stands in the pre@@ dominant demand of the federal state plan .
&quot; aim to take the track in December 2020 in operation , says Minister Hol@@ t@@ mann says Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; N@@ atus sees it a sign@@ post to support regional , but international comp@@ eting companies . &quot;

&quot; moreover , Wis@@ sing have an open ear for people who want to start with their own company stri@@ ves the I@@ HK . &quot;
the Hand@@ werk@@ sk@@ ammer Tri@@ er sees in the new Master @-@ Bonus an additional incentive for young tra@@ inees , says managing director Matthias Schwal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; provided is a premium volume of 1000 Euro for the advanced champion and 2500 Euro , if graduates within ten years after the master@@ class . &quot;
the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; in the planned road building can be fast facts , at the same time error the country at the necessary staff , says Jan Glock@@ auer , main business leaders of the I@@ HK Tri@@ er . &quot;

Audi is supposed to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - Aut@@ oh@@ er@@ ers see himself with a return reaction
&quot; one day before the announcement of Audi said BMW , that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW @-@ president said , the company is the opinion that &quot; there are intelligent options as driving restrictions , and related to European cities - including Munich where BMW is located - diesel vehicles to offer or limit . &quot;
Daim@@ ler was announced on Tuesday that there are three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the business as a recall .
European automobile manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon di@@ oxide emissions .
&quot; but the nit@@ rogen ox@@ ides , the diesel engines , are regarded as carb@@ onic and can cause as@@ thma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of automotive manufacturers , systems for neutr@@ alization of diesel vehicles sever@@ ely install ab@@ g@@ ases , also take what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot;
the German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also indic@@ ted to minim@@ ize the massive automobile companies and ignore signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen to avoid the use of so @-@ called sh@@ alt devices , which regul@@ ate emissions if a car was tested , but on normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several employees were charged by Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
last month the former head of the ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
&quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , Itali@@ ans and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be put in court in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was included in German criminal investigations into Volkswagen , after the authorities , Audi acc@@ used to have a system to re@@ acting the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request that was focused on the United States . &quot;
&quot; the inclusion of Audi in the study could be Volkswagen heavy burden : the luxury car manufacturer is also a proportion@@ ately to profit from Volkswagen at . &quot;

&quot; his message : lau@@ gh , &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Gu@@ ill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first few years as an artist , he proposed among other things as a sign of bl@@ ess cards by - what he frustr@@ ated him . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when in my job , he said . &quot;
&quot; according to stations in Lima , New York and Paris at the end of the 60@@ s of the breakthrough : with the publication of his cart@@ oons in Paris match &quot; and then also in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again the artists of cities inspire .
large , ro@@ bust@@ ling Mor@@ di@@ llo figures tum@@ ble in drawings with the rail tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning he has its own data , according to the character , it works almost ten hours a day . &quot;
&quot; about calendar , puzzles , books for Gross and small , T @-@ shirts , Pl@@ ush@@ pupp@@ ets and watches find its dro@@ ll figures still much spread worldwide . &quot;
&quot; for six years , he has been working in a cartoon with his figures for six years . &quot;
&quot; the main person in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los popular animal in its drawings - that has a thousand feet as a counter @-@ player . &quot;
&quot; for the first time his figures speak to the 3D film , coming to the chin @-@ wall . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they say , it is strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; that is why he is rather pointed to the TV series , which is produced , as its original records , password is produced . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lav@@ ender from Provence &quot; &quot; is threatened with climate change &quot;
&quot; he became a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; the Lav@@ ender is due to those of dro@@ ught remember@@ ing conditions and because of the disease mi@@ tig@@ ating insects sh@@ aking , what scientists and farmers who try to find solutions to find great head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agr@@ arian Institute CR@@ I@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; &quot; the Lav@@ ender in Provence is effective , because the plant has brought a lot less rain over the past few years and in autumn a lot more . &quot;
this has effects on the life of lav@@ ender .
&quot; there is also a small Z@@ ik@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that sur@@ v@@ ate d@@ warf @-@ shop , and in very dry weather there are very many of it . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
&quot; lav@@ ender oil is not only for holiday@@ makers , it is also very appreciated for perf@@ ume and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having a very long plant drilling with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , UN@@ TE@@ REN@@ TW@@ IC@@ K@@ EL@@ TE and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
so we have less parts with eth@@ eric oil . &quot;
&quot; among the solutions that are being considered , includes a better water distribution and the slow@@ ing of the dark from the ground , but also the cre@@ asing of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties , which are resistant to dry . &quot;

&quot; the staff of the weekly Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce will normally meet their plans for reporting about the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , cor@@ rupt officials and inv@@ ig@@ or@@ able drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on this day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
it was told to them that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ level journalists discuss what is safer to feel safe : they should take their children with the office , who were the purpose of an attack with gran@@ ates , or let them go home . &quot;
&quot; safety experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room : opponents , Neut@@ ral , allies . &quot;
&quot; you ask the repor@@ ter , suggest names for each column - no proof is needed , per@@ cep@@ tions and ab@@ dom@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; there are drug addi@@ tive , politicians , business@@ men , journalists , which will susp@@ ects , on the sal@@ ary of the government or cart@@ els , a catalog of bre@@ wing that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there are no break @-@ break from violence , and throughout the country the cor@@ p@@ ses , are more and more journalists doing so : at least 25 , since President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to in December 2012 took his office in December 2012 and until now there were at least seven T@@ ote in seven countries . &quot;
&quot; among the latter , its publisher and its inspir@@ ator of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the co @-@ founder of J@@ avier Val@@ de@@ z Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the greatest mistake is to be in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ de@@ z in one of his many books on violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; his absence will be deeply felt deep , although its presence is present everywhere - a large picture of Val@@ de@@ z , which shows its Middle finger in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Miriam Ram@@ i@@ rez , wearing T @-@ shirts , who will be his ridi@@ cul@@ ous face with glasses or its typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared topics , trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , ins@@ om@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although 2010 has established a probe @-@ pro@@ secution , in order to process the cases of journalists , this according to the Committee has led to the protection of journalists only two criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; as with most thousands of murder , which are linked each year with drug trading and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely asked before judgment . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , they still ins@@ ist to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ tr@@ apped and even though the terrain is now even betra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; without information on the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for the discussion of safety is little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very stup@@ id to wast@@ ing my time in this workshop , &quot; says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we do not know the Why , mis@@ str@@ ate us all . &quot;
&quot; in the morning of May , Val@@ de@@ z left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the state capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he managed just to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota CO@@ RO@@ LLA was stopped by two men . he was drawn from his car and 12 times was shot by his car , probably due to the name of the newspaper - the &quot; T@@ wel@@ ve river &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the fl@@ ush was driving in his car away and damaged it near .
Val@@ de@@ z was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adults children .
sm@@ ells tend to fly to Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an free .
but on the subject of Val@@ de@@ z there is practically nothing but silence .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ mans re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation last year and delivery in the United States in January was Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the blo@@ o@@ dies@@ t of the country , as riv@@ alised political groups fought here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot up on the road or that the cemetery is full of dev@@ oured , two @-@ stor@@ ey Maus@@ ol@@ een for drug royal , which are larger than many houses for the living . &quot;
&quot; for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; , &quot; if only one cart@@ el have control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ de@@ z was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , with the blame that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first , there was in February the release of a interviews with Dam@@ as@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of the ri@@ val@@ ing cardboard boxes in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans S@@ al . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have doubled the sons , susp@@ ected gear @-@ members bought each copy of the edition as soon as they delivered to time @-@ ki@@ os@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; the second mistake was to force Val@@ de@@ z not to force , after the con@@ fis@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story , the country to its own security . &quot;
Val@@ de@@ z was a leg@@ end in Mexico and abroad and his killing is considered as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survi@@ ved so long that his friends and colleagues ann@@ ah@@ ain that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced Repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este when he joined together with five colleagues for the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and 50 US dollars .
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without being on the noise @-@ gift problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; at the time the paper served a reputation because of the cour@@ ageous and honest reporting , and the turnover and the advertising took place . &quot;
&quot; repor@@ ter loving it , can publish hard ap@@ t investigations without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else to cover . &quot;
eight years after the formation of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot @-@ Prize &quot; for their reporting in Latin America .
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ de@@ z won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage in the pursuit of Mexican drugs , wherever it has led . &quot;
he gave vol@@ un@@ tar@@ ily to that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue on , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J . &quot;
&quot; drug stores in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV . &quot;
you have to assume the task that falls you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; what did you do given so many still@@ ed ... why did you not say what went before ? &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team missing Val@@ de@@ z , the Spa@@ eth , who could flu@@ ctu@@ ate like a port worker , the friend , the generous with h@@ ugs and advice . , a teacher , who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted on his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Guay@@ ama , the bar opposite from the office , and there are always sitting at the same table . &quot;
now ask them : was his love for routine his lo@@ wering ?
&quot; his death also has forced them to ask their own assu@@ mp@@ tions about it , how they can do their work best and stay alive . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their native Start@@ - and lan@@ es , to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ suffici@@ ency and self @-@ control . &quot;
his own inst@@ in@@ ths trust .
&quot; if it sm@@ ells , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; the sleeve is , the editor of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell a sense that can be dec@@ ei@@ ved , and then the thing happened with J@@ avier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , such as he and others are saying , in Sin@@ alo@@ a no longer - just as in Tam@@ au@@ li@@ pas , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a toxic mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gling , weak institutions and cor@@ rupt nation@@ wide at home . &quot;
the landscape changes constantly .
&quot; in the room where the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce met for the security training , suddenly had no hand@@ ys allowed . days previously was announced that Spy@@ ware who are sold solely to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
outside the two polic@@ emen protected from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a building .
they were commissioned by the provin@@ cial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ up building in a mid @-@ class quarter of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the Scher@@ z , some of the repor@@ ters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of polic@@ emen , who referred to the govern@@ or themselves as not trusted . &quot;
&quot; it is months ago , since the repor@@ ters went into the Ber@@ gl@@ and@@ h , where drugs called de facto under control . &quot;
for the issue of this week Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce has b@@ anned on three main stories .
there was the ass@@ ass@@ ination of the brother of the former known Box@@ er Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
&quot; they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the government , which was concentrated on the hom@@ etown of the Govern@@ or . &quot;
&quot; and there was one group , which in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , one block away from the office of the state , an ab@@ duction . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who kid@@ n@@ apped or how it happened , so caution was offered when it was time to write what each in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite locally from drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a repor@@ ter was import@@ ed out of public record , that the restaurant has been registered under the name of a policy that ruled by the Federal Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( Pr@@ i ) , which conqu@@ ered almost the whole century all political levels . &quot;
recently several pr@@ i govern@@ ors were acc@@ used because of high @-@ grade cases of corruption .
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter , about previous inci@@ dents in this eat@@ ery , including one , in which a son of &quot; El Ch@@ apo &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man went a military over@@ fall . &quot;
&quot; only a few months before , readers would have seen the Kolum@@ ne of Val@@ de@@ z as the best informed source about the kid@@ n@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; earlier we have known what happened , &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; El FLACO &quot; because of his sl@@ ender body . &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; the office of Val@@ de@@ z became a storage room for signs and stick@@ ers , dedicated to the murder of journalists all , because the employees have become something that she has never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
&quot; repor@@ ter Miriam Ram@@ i@@ rez , a few characters and went in the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the state . &quot;
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared after three days after Val@@ de@@ z was killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; a burned body has been discovered and officials tell , based on DNA tests that it is its . &quot;
&quot; in the whole country , journalists have become loud , by organised in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; in walking and construction . &quot;
on that day the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone into Washington and tries to raise international support for justice in the case of Val@@ de@@ z .
&quot; during a meeting with the Govern@@ or of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the murder of Val@@ de@@ z , Ram@@ i@@ rez the authorities to send journalists and bring them to leave because they have said the truth . &quot;
&quot; it has been asked since that she is shared again from the government , because it is worried that their anger has been inj@@ ured their obj@@ ectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ de@@ z has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico by organised crime , used to be involved in government and a consistent society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters are not only killed by drugs states , but also on the command of politicians and safety sc@@ ents , which were organised with organised crime under a ceiling . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo &quot; &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; has identified more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico dies you , because they would like that you dis@@ proportion@@ ate the mouth , &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot;
obviously the mor@@ de have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody for@@ got the death of the blog@@ ger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as at the northern border state Tam@@ au@@ li@@ pas before six years ago .
&quot; your body was found along with a note that was supposed to be signed by Z@@ et@@ as @-@ Kart@@ ell , &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer @-@ por@@ g@@ ur and ear@@ phones in addition to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Ch@@ ihu@@ ah@@ ua after the correspon@@ dent of the correspon@@ dents of Mi@@ ro@@ sl@@ ava Bre@@ ach in March .
&quot; others continue to make like El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo , after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of its directors in 2004 . &quot;
in 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ are@@ z started publicly on drug cart@@ els with a editorial paper on the title page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ?
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a pain@@ ful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile and they still watch the roads and look for dangers .
&quot; and sometimes they will be hun@@ ted , as it seems to be the photographer Ruben Esp@@ in@@ osa , which was mur@@ dered by four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who remain back and continue to continue , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , the once po@@ et wanted to be po@@ et , gives that the drug stores it sc@@ ares . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and that is why I became repor@@ ter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in order to finish midnight on last Friday , when the last issue was already ended , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce on the side@@ walk in front of the office and d@@ rank beer , when all their phones started . &quot;
a series of cont@@ ours with band@@ en@@ riv@@ als and safety sc@@ r@@ als near the beach Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed tr@@ ote .
the war escal@@ ates on how it was promised by a number of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
&quot; from the bin@@ ary canal , they released the news on the website of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce via mobile phone . &quot;
the front page had to change the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens he@@ ou@@ ted nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez cast a look at the police officers who stopped to see if they were in read@@ iness .
if they were afraid of all they did not show it .
&quot; under the enormous portrait of the newspaper of the newspaper , whose mid @-@ finger was visible to Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce followed its foot@@ steps . &quot;
&quot; how can you only think about it , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; said on the same day , at the J@@ avier , the internship was asked to send it to the coverage of the road . &quot;
din@@ osaur@@ s used cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to switch to its enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue even though a fri@@ ght@@ ening .
&quot; now researchers have found that the first findings of the unbeliev@@ able n@@ ash@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian mountain labor@@ er have been so well received that experts are described as &quot; &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of Din@@ osaur@@ s &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was so good that they could even notice that his created skin of red@@ dish Braun was - and they said , she would have had something of a &quot; un@@ quiet past . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the magazine &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; &quot; referred to him as &quot; the poss@@ essing @-@ mor@@ ed din@@ osaur@@ s that has ever been found , and one of the best din@@ os@@ aur specim@@ en of the world . &quot;
f@@ ossil is a newly discovered kind of N@@ od@@ osaur@@ s that lived in the middle of the circle time between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; his unbeliev@@ ably well preserved condition has researchers , who described it as &quot; really remarkable &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ aters is the best preserved f@@ ossil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn F@@ unk , when he was born on 21 March 2011 at the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he met something that appeared from the surrounding rock in the Plat@@ ze , and decided to watch more precise . &quot;
the F@@ ossil discovered that F@@ ossil was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ aces .
&quot; they spent the next six years to cover the wild animal within the 2,@@ 500 pounds ( 1.@@ 100 kg ) of heavy stra@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work the finished result is ready to be revealed , un@@ vei@@ led . &quot;
&quot; if you only have a little with the eyes of blin@@ zeln you could almost believe it slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientists in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the cre@@ ature can be seen . &quot;
&quot; it will go into the sciences &apos;s history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osaur@@ s , the Mon@@ a Lisa of Din@@ osaur@@ s . &quot;
&quot; researchers have found that this plant fres@@ ser , though he is covered with a arm@@ ament and resem@@ bles a changing tanks , probably from meat to send Din@@ osaur@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the strongly ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osaur@@ s used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to hide in front of rob@@ ber@@ y , and used a sh@@ iel@@ ding technology that is also used as a counter@@ part which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have allowed it to mix well into its surroundings and develop its enemies , say experts , which indicates that it was threatened by greater din@@ os@@ aur . &quot;
the 110 million years old cre@@ ature from the family of the N@@ od@@ osaur@@ s joined the first time in May and is now seen in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ o .
&quot; researchers have studied the wild beast and it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ ch@@ elli after the Mus@@ eum@@ st@@ echni@@ cs Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7.@@ 000 hours so it was carefully c@@ eil@@ ings . &quot;
the amazing preservation of the specim@@ en made it at Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists who document patterns and form of shoe and arm@@ aments across his body .
&quot; they discovered the const@@ ants , a widespread defen@@ sive method in the animal kingdom , which means the tip of the cre@@ ature dar@@ ker was considered their under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the con@@ ter@@ sh@@ aded is common , the results are surprisingly , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exce@@ eds that of today living animals . &quot;
&quot; it indicates that the din@@ osaur@@ s have enough pressure through the meat and send Din@@ osaur@@ s , that the evolution was favour@@ ed the confrontation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most contemporary animals who use the ter@@ sh@@ ades - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or gir@@ th - are much smaller and hurt as lo@@ ot , which sign@@ aled that this N@@ od@@ osaur@@ s was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong rough@@ ness behaviour on a massive , strong ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osaur@@ s show how dangerous the din@@ osaur@@ s @-@ Rau@@ b@@ ins have been to have been the cra@@ dle time , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organised connections in their sk@@ als also shows that the skin of din@@ osaur@@ s was red .
&quot; scientists continue to investigate the animal in references to his life , including its contra@@ sting Dar@@ min@@ hal@@ tes to find out what it has eaten as its last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osaur@@ s died when he died , into a river and into the sea , where he was on the back to the sea . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably much more inland than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this N@@ od@@ osaur@@ s is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with consistent skin , but also in three dimensions remains intact and the original form of the animal re@@ tains , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal is almost as it looks like in the early circle .
&quot; you do not need much imagination to use it . if you just have a little with the eyes sh@@ iel@@ s , you could almost believe that he is on sleep . &quot;
&quot; the circle was a time , as huge spa , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ess Din@@ osaur@@ s , which stood on two legs , the earth crossed . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ nos@@ aurus re@@ x , millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osaur@@ s was hun@@ ted by some of his terrible ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ os@@ aurus , a 38 feet ( 11,@@ 5 m ) long , six tonnes of heavy monsters . &quot;
scientists who appear their latest findings in the journal Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta came to the death in the sea and in mud m@@ um@@ i@@ fies . &quot;
&quot; the cre@@ ature was found by Sha@@ wn F@@ unk , when he was born on 21 March 2011 at the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum it is the best @-@ lasting Din@@ osaur@@ s of the world , including skin and arm@@ ament , and is completely from the cuts up to the hips . &quot;
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weigh@@ ed up to 3.000 pounds ( 1.@@ 300 kg ) .
it contains two 20 @-@ inch @-@ long peaks that rag@@ ed by his shoul@@ ders .
&quot; the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ fres@@ ser was wel@@ ded by the Western Canada , until a flo@@ o@@ ded river it was flo@@ o@@ ded into the open sea . &quot;
but the under@@ water cre@@ m@@ ation of the din@@ osaur@@ s keep its arm@@ ament in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this specific specim@@ en are so well preserved that the skin res@@ ist still hol@@ low tank @-@ boards along the din@@ osaur@@ s
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as &apos; rare as a profit in the Lot@@ to . &quot;
&quot; the more I make it , the more conf@@ using it . &quot;
hidden remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y tank @-@ plates that carry the sk@@ ull of the animal .
&quot; his right edge is on his side , his five fingers are cut down to the top . &quot;
I can count the shoes on his sole one .
in the storm : mass bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many Ver@@ itas
fier@@ ce accident on Thurs@@ day@@ evening on the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 cars are ent@@ angl@@ ed in a massage @-@ bol@@ ting .
&quot; there are numerous dou@@ bles , long @-@ long stor@@ ms - and g@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) will be viol@@ ated about 20 people in the late Thursday morning ( A@@ 8 ) .
&quot; after the first information of the police , the police officers were between the connection of Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a plum@@ age of almost 30 cars , among them probably also lor@@ ries , in@@ tuition . &quot;
&quot; above , the exact number of the final rates do not contain any information before . &quot;
it handle light to medium serious injury , said a police force . &quot;
a large listing of lif@@ ebo@@ ards was at the accident .
the A@@ 8 was fully locked in the direction of Munich .
in the transfer of Munich is a round about ten kilometers long back@@ drop .
as an AZ @-@ Repor@@ ter was also reported on the road @-@ car to massive disabilities - due to numerous gen@@ es .
&quot; the fire not@@ ched themselves to have a characteristic of the vehicle &apos;s vehicle , which now have to count with sensitive pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 p.m. , then a second accident at the A@@ 8 , this time between Aug@@ sburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a coll@@ ision between an auto@@ ot@@ ran@@ ces and a car .

Deutsche Bahn : Group test@@ et &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before : nothing is sitting in the train and sleeps .
or it is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a ing@@ eni@@ ous thoughts .
and then : exhau@@ st .
&quot; comes the production , and put an impro@@ p , or drop the driver in the middle of the work@@ flow . &quot;
fot@@ od@@ ru@@ cker .
but times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are soon over .
the German rail@@ ways are currently creating the pay@@ roll box .
&quot; one is confirmed simply by phone , that you have taken its place and evaluated so that the ticket . &quot;
&quot; currently , a test operation runs on two routes . &quot;
&quot; comes the offer , we extend it out . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to be available in Germany at the beginning of next year on many other transportation routes in Germany , &quot; said a rail speaker . &quot;
&quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; calls the train the roadmap de@@ val@@ uation without creativity .
&quot; in order to use the use , however , some conditions must be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to have booked a online ticket - what already do most passengers have to do .
&quot; you also have to have purchased it via the app of the train , the DB Navigator software , which is the easi@@ est way of ticket booking . &quot;
and finally you need a seating reservation .
&quot; for the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; does not work : one climb@@ s into the train , calling the ticket under &quot; My Tickets &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with the test customers , a button then appears to the electronic de@@ val@@ uation . &quot;
the draw@@ backs get on their mobile devices a message that driver @-@ ast X is located on the train and the square seating area Y has taken .
&quot; comes the enc@@ amp@@ er in place Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already un@@ paid online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can continue to sleep , continue to remain silent . &quot;
&quot; check in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train , which in turn should take advantage of the passengers . &quot;
&quot; who relaxed without tick@@ eting control through our train service , you are able to simply put yourself in the DB Navigator . &quot;
&quot; this enables the passengers to make their travel time in train personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing @-@ Board of DB Station . &quot;
&quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to address the individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; who often travel , knows that in addition to delays and pass@@ able bre@@ wing are the driving pul@@ leys on the greatest hass@@ le . &quot;
&quot; for often you have , in any case , but one of those looking for not all documents that you need to use the de@@ val@@ uation of online tickets . &quot;
&quot; either the credit card or use of personnel , or otherwise a document that you have to as@@ sign . &quot;
&quot; the consequence are endless discussion between accessibility and sec@@ ast , which leads to bad mood in the evenings or work@@ space and delays in control of your own tickets and decre@@ ases at the end of time to take care of other concerns . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and even at the ICE ICE Top 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart und ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
additional access numbers on the same track are not yet activated .
how a activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sh@@ aken to its core .
&quot; just one day after having arrived in New York City , the church was born in St. Louis born on the bed of an Air@@ bn@@ b flat where they rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on their phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled upon a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year child , and there is still on the road , &quot; it was there . &quot;
&quot; confused as no one had posted on their fe@@ ed the information , closed she Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Handle @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly ret@@ we@@ et@@ et on their tim@@ eline .
&quot; the R@@ apper from the territory of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 year @-@ year , who was killed by a white polic@@ emen in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed , live at home . &quot;
he posted an image of Brow@@ ns vi@@ vid body that was stretched on the road and stay there four hours .
&quot; that is wild , I thought fer@@ rell . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
&quot; she placed her cell phone , to return later in the evening to Twe@@ ets over people at the Can@@ field drive . &quot;
&quot; there were photos of the police band and people , the cri@@ ed , and from a man who said , Brow@@ ns Father , who contributed a sign with the wor@@ ding : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
&quot; they observe a live fe@@ ed , where a polic@@ eman was in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a rebel@@ li@@ ous dog . &quot;
&quot; in another video , she said , de@@ ed another policy is his ri@@ f@@ le and cri@@ b : &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; remember@@ ed Fer@@ rell to their statement . &quot;
that is not the kind of murder that we have acc@@ ust@@ omed to us and that we can name typical .
in this moment I felt shame .
I was angry and w@@ ept . &quot;
they booked a retreat and went home on the next day .
&quot; after the landing at 23 h , she took her 6 year old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the subject of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; in the cin@@ emas from the 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a history of survival and Protest@@ es , of love and loss , the strength and the contradictions which consists of the view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to ask answers . &quot;
&quot; as a fer@@ rell with her daughter , which carried a flower dress and a suitable crown carried , after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two a conversation that they had countless times before this morning &quot; over the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; you only remin@@ ding you , as I have taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; remember what she said . &quot;
&quot; we go now to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police have killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take them , &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot;
what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it has to know and it must be educated and educated in it .
&quot; it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organisation but also to know the different layers of black experience and the black constitution , and what we must do to free to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have the luck to give her an experience , where they personally have no e@@ kl@@ at@@ ant rac@@ ism , it is not different than the next black women @-@ child . &quot;
&quot; I have the feeling , I would prove her a bad service to keep them away . &quot;
&quot; the first station when she arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which was founded to a camp@@ ground than the activists on the possible non @-@ indic@@ t@@ ment of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined together with a local business owner , the lunch made . &quot;
they prepared po@@ ckets before and hal@@ ves them to pass on demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism started to accept fer@@ rell shape .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed completely changed after the 9th of August , she said and noticed that she was as a student at the University of Miss@@ our@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of Min@@ ority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black municipalities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it is all come . &quot;
weeks later fer@@ rell during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ director of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her comrades Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ .exe wanted to be &quot; documented , &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came Fer@@ rell into the meaning : &quot; &quot; want to document her , or tries to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
&quot; these skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wisdom - in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and resistance strength . &quot;
&quot; like Fol@@ ay@@ an recently declared in an interview : &quot; we had heard that people who have born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and raised their voices , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the former Co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the field , which is known for its activ@@ ism around dead@@ lines . &quot;
his commitment brought Fer@@ rell the project closer together with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after brow@@ ns .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we talk , &quot; said Davis &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people will be represented , because I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ ells experience - to show that in the movement it is not a Messi@@ ah leader , but to a community that comes together , said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the apparent participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; consequently show documents from &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ ells lives , as she loves himself and her wife mar@@ ries . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability at this work and in the ail@@ ment of black people .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ ells history repeated history the role of black gay women in the broader Black @-@ Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , which have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media in 2012 , identify themselves as pregnant . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women have to carry the main last of everything . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an atmosph@@ eric , to notice that &quot; the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it is however that &quot; this is not a prag@@ matic type of action , &quot; at the Fer@@ rell due to its identity as the heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person that ended up this energy , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is no co@@ incidence , although she was at the front line because in a life on these crosses than a black , gay woman is so much on the game . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the news mates in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the r@@ acial connections between the church and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Fer@@ rell is on nutrition for 2 ½ years because of the block@@ ages of a highway with a demonstration .
&quot; she describes the social policy atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; &quot; a chaos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , she smil@@ ed out for a voc@@ als and she feels obliged to this memory , since they left three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the road . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we have to love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; Greater W@@ ahn &quot; : TV @-@ readers discuss about bit @-@ gallery
the bit gallery moves the human being although they haven &apos;t been built for a long time .
but the idea of a mall at the Sü@@ ver of the pedestrian zone has been developed since the first presentation of 2009 the population in supporters and opponents .
cold leaves the subject hardly any one .
&quot; also on our Facebook @-@ Page &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; will be discussed the subject . &quot;
&quot; while the one of the bit Gallery say : &quot; &quot; this would be a dream &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; This would be real &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other hand : &quot; &quot; does not need a man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ rest ) or quite simply : &quot; &quot; biggest &quot; &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot;
&quot; while the advoc@@ ates are building that a gallery attrac@@ ts more customers to the city , including the rest of the shops , the enemy , that then the pedestrian prec@@ eding . &quot;
&quot; added : the gallery is planned exactly on the property , on which the peas@@ ant market stands in the 13 direct market@@ ed its products . &quot;
with the beginning of the construction work will be the conclusion .
&quot; the gallery Mak@@ ers want to integrate a market hall in the new construction - namely to the Bed@@ a square , with possibility to go out for sitting outside . &quot;
Simone Rooms : &quot; we have been for many years almost weekly in the peas@@ ant market hall . &quot;
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the land@@ lady always like to be very happy . &quot;
also the but@@ cher we have discovered for us .
we would like that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
there are also other cities in other cities .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ensing : &quot; whether a director is market@@ ed in a market hall in the gallery , comes to the amount of rent . &quot;
but it is likely to be very low in the new project . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; weigh@@ ed shopping in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; clothing , shoes , clothing or supermarkets : I find this super@@ flu@@ ous . &quot;
there are already enough in our city .
&quot; however , one sees how many stores are empty here - some have been here for months and years . &quot;
&quot; however , there is not even a weekly calendar market , it is all the more important that we have left us at least the market hall . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered there is fresh , mostly directly from the producers and is available above . &quot;
&quot; how to see , stores in a shopping center only collect from larger companies , as the dor@@ mit@@ ory ten@@ ets are often not portable for a retail@@ er . &quot;
&quot; too bad , special run there is almost no more and what still exists , will probably also disappear . &quot;
Wolf Fan@@ del : &quot; a mall with a market hall is not fit together for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where is the peas@@ ant market during construction time ?
&quot; the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even on duration , if the bit gallery will actually come . &quot;
or creates the Ges@@ pen@@ st bit gallery already before , all the shops from Bit@@ burg to exp@@ el ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this will simply not work .
&quot; and a shopping center , which is empty , does not need any one . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a peas@@ ant market , it is thanks to the angry many - as I find - sensu@@ ous construction projects in Bit@@ burg no place anymore . &quot;
&quot; when the peas@@ ant market was broken , will disappear a piece of culture disappear . &quot;
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
&quot; in the middle of the room of the fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York there are many faces - white , black and brown , which are almost in@@ strange same - which hang out of the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ aves @-@ T@@ up@@ far and H@@ acks that were sent by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from the prison of Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former intelligence service analy@@ sed was a 35 @-@ year prison @-@ sentence , after she made a secret of diplomatic news about the website Wiki@@ Le@@ aks publicly . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition that was opened on August 2 , A Be@@ coming res@@ emb@@ lance ( A suitable simil@@ arity ) . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was transformed into technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ wife and motor@@ ised discretion , whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorith@@ ms analysis of DNA that could be extrac@@ ted by Mann@@ ing and created out of the 30 portraits of DNA that could be interpreted as a bit of intellectual comment - the many ways as they can be interpreted and the cur@@ ing determin@@ ation@@ ism of these interpre@@ tations - but also to identity .
&quot; Mann@@ ing that was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has been spoken openly since its pu@@ ber@@ ty on the identification as a woman , including six violations of the Sp@@ ion@@ age utility , computer amoun@@ ted and theft . &quot;
&quot; through the prison its image was supp@@ res@@ sed , so much that it was only a single photo - a gran@@ ularity , black @-@ white Sel@@ f@@ ie , in the cre@@ asing is clearly sitting on a seat and a plat@@ inum status - which it was associated with it . &quot;
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came straight from the great success of its 2012 @-@ project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
&quot; in this , the artist portraits of foreig@@ ners from for@@ ensic art@@ ef@@ acts such as cigar@@ ette m@@ ute and ch@@ ew@@ ing g@@ um , in order to extract the DNA out of the waste to make a picture of how these people could look . &quot;
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a time @-@ level agaz@@ in .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press release of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photograph@@ ed , so they took contact with Chelsea , and asked them if they wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
&quot; the artist and her in@@ ex@@ ited m@@ use have been un@@ equal to un@@ equal bri@@ cks , which are inter@@ change@@ able over the course of two years . &quot;
&quot; they even created one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o Ill@@ ustri@@ erte Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ res@@ sed Images , &quot; which would fores@@ ee a future in which the President chel@@ ten@@ judgment would change and it would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was released , Mann@@ ing release after seven bru@@ tal years would demand in K@@ ansas , was a welcome kind of happy @-@ co@@ incidence . &quot;
&quot; there is also now on the opening of the exhibition somewhat deeper and star@@ kes as Donald Tru@@ mp leads to war against in@@ forman@@ t from the government of government and against trans@@ gender troops , to find new , twe@@ et ways to fix the rigi@@ d divisions that he actually should fix . &quot;
&quot; as De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg after the strange timing of all these things was asked , she said that &quot; things are coming from a certain reason . &quot;
&quot; in one on the wall of Galerie written statement called Mann@@ ing with her over@@ great signature , including ( &quot; &quot; i &quot; &quot; in their sur@@ name , is provided with a heart ) an end of the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose foundation gender , breed , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall , its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA @-@ sequence - a thousand feet of C@@ s and GS and As , in pen@@ cil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hop@@ ed , through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nu@@ cle@@ ot@@ ide by the highly developed scientific dic@@ tionary of the artist ) , how amazing , at least in biological terms , we all are . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully bring to that our gen@@ ome is not taking care of who we are and how is open genetic data for a interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , their video @-@ Werk of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so that 30 of these stories are . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition that is kept in a separate room is one side from the above mentioned Com@@ ic Nov@@ elle .
&quot; it shows Mann@@ ing , as it appears with a free @-@ spre@@ y in the hand from the disciplines of the United States as King @-@ Kong . &quot;
&quot; if they put your speech , then they won &quot; &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; so , never give the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter I wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist , who greet from Philadelphia . &quot;
I &apos;m still going to be gri@@ ps when I talk about it .
&quot; Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition yet personally - as it was predic@@ table in the Com@@ ic@@ onic magazine - but if they should do it , then it will be welcomed in the center of the room from the masks , which coinci@@ de like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also focused on how everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , where their genetic h@@ ap@@ log@@ s were written with pen@@ cil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd , said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement , which formed with Chelsea , as the movement , which also got behind its release . &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and a Employee of the University of Oxford for killing .
a national @-@ wide human ch@@ asing is going on for a professor at the North@@ western University and a staff of Oxford University who were looking for a susp@@ ects after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with dead@@ ly inj@@ uries .
&quot; on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) ar@@ rest warran@@ t due to the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Cor@@ nell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au issued as the acts of the Court of C@@ ook County . &quot;
&quot; the documents say that Cor@@ nell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , after several stit@@ ches died . &quot;
&quot; one of the police authority of Chicago published by Chicago , meant that the body was discovered on 27 July . &quot;
&quot; officials received a call , came to the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several inj@@ uries of his body . &quot;
&quot; Cor@@ nell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still explained on the place of action for dead , and det@@ ective the stit@@ ching as murder , while the police are active after the two susp@@ ects , said officials . &quot;
L@@ ath@@ em has been extraordinary Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at the North@@ western University since 2007 .
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ b@@ age , the Vice President for university relationships , said in an e @-@ mail statement that L@@ ath@@ em now said in be@@ gue , and be ruled by the University of North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal issue that is investigated by the competent authorities and the North@@ western University co@@ operates at this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ b@@ age . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; a speaker of the University and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are willing to help the US public authorities . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were shock@@ ed and want to set itself .
&quot; Chief Communications Officer of the police authorities of Chicago , Anthony Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi , said , he challenging the sus@@ pic@@ ion to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police has a vision of their stay , and our efforts to loc@@ alize it , &quot; &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the building of the Grand @-@ plaza of the Grand @-@ plaza that had just received a puzz@@ ling tip , the said that something happened in an apartment . &quot;
the police described the scene as a very cru@@ el .
&quot; Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said , it was not clear whether the inci@@ dent took place on 27 July . &quot;
it was confirmed by security cameras that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation of the inhabitants : &quot; the police currently works on the timeline and the background of the sacrifice and expl@@ ores a variety of moti@@ ves , including a possible content . &quot;
&quot; we will close the W@@ ada roadmap in the near future &quot; - the Russian Vi@@ cephal@@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
&quot; the Russian Vi@@ cephal@@ re@@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said , it won &apos;t take long before the remaining criteria of the world @-@ anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( W@@ ada ) to restore the Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( R@@ USA@@ DA ) . &quot;
&quot; at a particular stage in meeting the criteria of the roadmap , R@@ USA@@ DA has received the right to plan and test with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) . &quot;
&quot; the W@@ ada roadmap has been updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the PM commented the second part of the roadmap of the W@@ ada to comply with the code , which describes the criteria for re@@ installing R@@ USA@@ DA and recently published on the organisation &apos;s website . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he contains nothing that could give rise to concern for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything was announced , everything is being implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) and W@@ ada in the near future , he added . &quot;
&quot; one of the criteria listed in the list mentioned criteria , however , stres@@ ses that the Russian anti @-@ Dop@@ ing authorities must accept the reported findings from the W@@ ada conducted by the Canadian attor@@ ney by Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren on con@@ fes@@ tive suffering in the Russian sport . &quot;
&quot; in relation to the matter Mut@@ ko : &quot; &quot; we lead the investigation by , since our anti @-@ Dop@@ ing system has put an error . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there was no state programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ iny words with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ nov , leader of the independent Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with Russian sales office R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ nov had problems of the past in Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing organizations , then added : &quot; &quot; we have repeatedly told that the report contains contro@@ versi@@ al positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; nobody has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; he added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot;
R@@ USA@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 in the wake of the Dop@@ ing sc@@ and@@ als from the W@@ ada of implementing Dop@@ ing controlled in Russia .
&quot; however , it has been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ( UK@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after visiting the main qu@@ arti@@ ers of the organization in Moscow in July , W@@ ada @-@ General Director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli , that R@@ USA@@ DA is moving in the right direction &quot; &quot; to be used again . &quot;

the start @-@ ups that will help your company not to become a next U@@ ber
Amy Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the surveys did not function .
&quot; answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - gri@@ ev@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; and even if you said an@@ onym@@ ity , some workers did not stop the process . &quot;
&quot; there was just never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who operates the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce H@@ air Care Society Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot;
she brought people from outside to help .
a new race of human resources start @-@ ups is to help companies to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; by creating and licensing of software , which has the specific purpose of the measurement of employee engagement , it enables companies to perform surveys , speci@@ als groups and demo@@ graphic groups to address , employees an@@ onym@@ ity and complaint @-@ hot@@ lines , and in some cases wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers , to turn the C @-@ Suite ex@@ ecutives and turn directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; you have now tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ Bit for persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ Bit for your business ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , Co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software @-@ analytics tools is used to measure employees commitment . &quot;
&quot; Er@@ ret@@ t said that she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the S@@ nap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows on a glance which units have most complaints and which ex@@ ecutives low supplement results - so that you can re@@ bo@@ ise why . &quot;
&quot; we come to see that at the top of the workplace culture , so you will not have been involved in Sk@@ and@@ ale , who has been published in Sk@@ and@@ ale since then , a former employee has published a blog post office , who have spoken and pun@@ ished by those who have been pun@@ ished . &quot;
for start @-@ ups as G@@ lin@@ t is this desire for an overview a lu@@ cr@@ ative business ability .
&quot; the Global Governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 118@@ ,@@ 7 billion value , according to the financing technical site Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to avoid bad behaviour and see , an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year , in the midst of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ redi@@ t . &quot;
&quot; convert nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ bn@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
&quot; like G@@ lin@@ t , convert Conver@@ cent company tailored &quot; &quot; pulse &quot; &quot; surveys , confidence in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas . &quot;
it also offers an anonymous SMS @-@ hot@@ line with the employee of bad behavior .
&quot; and if the captain leader is included , complaints can go directly to the Super@@ visory Board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion has recorded the ra@@ ils , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and managing director of Conver@@ t . &quot;
&quot; if a company is found that his staff is treated badly or beh@@ aves un@@ ethical , there may be precious consequences by consumers of boy@@ cot@@ t , worker flu@@ ctu@@ ation and sounds , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant @-@ chain with more than 25@@ ,000 employees and over 500 locations , convert Conver@@ t for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and processes and have a simple way to achieve their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; earlier when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she wanted to find a phone number or e @-@ mail for the corporate headquarters , a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a in@@ tim@@ id@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said , there was no good opportunity to pursue complaints from employees . &quot;
&quot; now , since the company convert Conver@@ cent , may have problems that were previously identified by leaders , which were hidden in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , insu@@ lator , or in@@ lau@@ ght@@ ered internship will be identified faster and addressed . &quot;
&quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ level view in the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the risk management Group by Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders before employment , dispute . &quot;
&quot; companies began to take ethics , values and employees working in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen , because of eth@@ eric violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; but it lasted until the &quot; Social media entered their right to their right , &quot; that companies knew that you could not prevent that their dirty laundry online . &quot;
&quot; before using technology for monitoring of ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ t offer your software as a service , and loaded the company with recur@@ rent fees for the use of their products . &quot;
it is a business model and a chance that supports the approval of Venture Capital investors who have supported both Start @-@ ups .
&quot; convert $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sap@@ ph@@ ire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the entire capital has been raised to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; celeb@@ rates , $ 10 million in November by Bess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought his entire financing to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising considering the inter@@ connected nature of companies , culture and Venture Capital . &quot;
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more and more jobs than before .
competitive markets such as Sili@@ con Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only missions .
employees want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that heard their voices , and that work that you do is worthwhile , then they feel stronger to make this company successful &quot; , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Employee Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which is both Conver@@ t and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
&quot; investors accomplish Ren@@ ters if their portfolio companies are well running . companies run good , if employees are campa@@ ig@@ ning and are engaged . &quot;
&quot; if the analytics tools of third parties speak , commitment and use of employees , it is no wonder that you can find support . &quot;
the data on the employees in the work of workplace culture is important .
but the data are us@@ eless if the car@@ et@@ aker of a firm cannot take action .
&quot; in fact , when a company asks employees to your feedback , it can have an expect@@ ation that change on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the shift does not come quickly enough , or not at all , this dis@@ appointments can breed and sm@@ itter . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4@@ ,000 suggestions , you need to be ready to have 4@@ ,000 conversations , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen themselves to the collecting of data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow our employees , &quot; did you really hear about it ? &quot;
do you take care of this ?
and who do not take care of why should I ?
&quot; Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , which is now leading to monthly employee surveys , was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported via G@@ lin@@ t , so Er@@ ret@@ t . &quot;
&quot; and after the collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated staff , it was able to organize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; in Ruby Tuesday , the company receives new insights about the staff , and it hopes that in a long run , this leads to a better bond of workers in a branch that is known for high ren@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose the people , &quot; said vitality . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose human beings , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , you will lose them . &quot;
the N@@ CAA remo@@ ves the two @-@ days practices and makes a long day for the br@@ ins
&quot; it goes on 23 o &apos;clock , as a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ soccer player is enter@@ tained on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus . &quot;
some have moved their tri@@ m parts and show the back full of swe@@ at from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team these uns@@ ure a lunch break .
&quot; players who are written to the summer courses , are returning after the three hours of exercise at their final test , before they return the next morning at 6 : 30 am to the Aqu@@ arius Football Center . &quot;
&quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real Tre@@ kking , &quot; said Br@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday became Tuesday . &quot;
the N@@ CAA eliminated two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the burden of players and she has actually extended their days - at least until the finale on Friday .
&quot; therefore , the first three training of U@@ C@@ LA should begin at 19 : 15 Uhr in order to meet the already packed schedul@@ es of the player . &quot;
the compromise away from the two days is more than one day when the br@@ ins moved to the beginning of the Camp@@ s almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six play@@ times in West@@ wood practical exercises .
&quot; in the course of August 18 exercises , they are supposed to hold the exercises in the course of August 18 exercises . 20 before the beginning of formal game preparations for their opening against Texas A &amp; M in September . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he support the change of the N@@ CAA &apos;s change , even if they add the busy routes of players another point . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous burden on three or four days on them , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they just pushed it down , they plac@@ ken further , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it &apos;s really great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will end their practices once the camp is finished , allowing the clear view of its fields marked by an adjacent parking and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the hosted class , which is already sp@@ elled behind a tor@@ ped@@ als , no easy task will be . &quot;
&quot; brood @-@ players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a sp@@ ends that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched that people will rent a room and then adjust it to a exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the video of a exercise , it is a fairly good deal . &quot;
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I do not worry too much about this .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit messages
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false feedback from third parties and show their results under the original contribution then , the world &apos;s largest online social @-@ network on Thursday . it is one of its efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News . &quot;
&quot; the company said in an opinion on his website , that it will start with the use of updated machine methods start to identify possible fal@@ sity , and to send them to fac@@ tual check @-@ out of the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook was cri@@ tici@@ zed as one of the main aims for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ news , many believe that they also influences the US presidential elections in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a great political issue in Europe , with the French voters in advance of the presidential elections in May with false stories , and Germany support a plan , according to social media networks shall be pun@@ ished , as they will not succeed , h@@ asser@@ ted out@@ ings as before the elections in September quickly . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook told a separate declaration in English , that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany will start a test of new facts . &quot;
&quot; in addition to knowledge , which stories of Fak@@ ten@@ veri@@ fiable parties want to read more context in order to make sound decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , Product manag@@ erin for Facebook @-@ News in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook continue to test his feature to the &quot; &quot; related articles &quot; &quot; and works on other changes to his news fe@@ ed to reduce the wrong messages . &quot;
creating a Com@@ ic @-@ RO@@ MAN@@ S : a castle in the history of England
&quot; in its recent past , the small Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a Squ@@ ee@@ ze @-@ Musik@@ video and was for mar@@ gar@@ et Th@@ at@@ cher in 1970 @-@ er and 1980 @-@ er years . &quot;
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history of its cozy seat in the valley of K@@ ent , and now is the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jam@@ ie Rhodes , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ ms , with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so nice to look at the manus@@ cript of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he said . &quot;
what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &apos;s sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another , upcoming British artists , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Is@@ abel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rhodes , which is based on a archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was un@@ expected emotional . &quot;
&quot; I have only re@@ acted on the thumb on the side of a letter , which was written by a double bed in the 1700 @-@ s , he says for the Jaco@@ b@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is his continuous print !
&quot; and letters always sm@@ elling to smoke , because at that time it ign@@ ano@@ due a fire because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives for 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love Archive ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who be@@ aten so with old pep@@ per is that he was supported by National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have to be honest a little over@@ rated &quot; ) , all this seems to be true to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rhodes spent his days to explore the Vi@@ kt@@ ori@@ ans &quot; new &quot; castle to study the archives and had spent the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mon@@ archy &apos;s heads in walls and the bottles , the centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he emig@@ rated by the grounds and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with land@@ lady , garden@@ ers and sometimes also with the artists who worked at the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night d@@ rank he &quot; &quot; Whiskey and began to write . &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust received the full access only in 2006 as the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey . &quot;
&quot; as Rhodes a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive , which he said as &quot; hundreds of years , in which arist@@ oc@@ rats told &quot; Oh , wir@@ es it on the loft . &quot;
&quot; books , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , cards , those who poss@@ essed : &quot; you might think that country @-@ fli@@ ed boring would be &quot; , &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have fought the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let all his gang go ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to put on the wider basis in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , who leaves a man who built the newly built castle to connect to the peas@@ antry of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record from a tur@@ mo@@ il that entered 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book with the title &apos; K@@ night@@ ly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rhodes . &quot;
&quot; the farmhouse began in this area and I thought , a revol@@ t was a good start . &quot;
maybe the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot;
other stories are firmly root@@ ed in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; who told the history of the Jes@@ uit lim@@ ers who hidden the family Dar@@ rell seven years during the English Reformation .
&quot; or &apos; The Sm@@ ug@@ gler &apos; , represented in which the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rell from the 18th century is shown that he filled with a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was only years later , when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rhodes &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be quite a g@@ aun@@ er , getting back debt and spend money for things they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men proceeds their debt crises , by married rich old women - I imagine it as a p@@ ile well @-@ looking guys before , with a talent to advertise Er@@ bin@@ nen . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his efforts in the castle , Rhodes is in search of other unique typ@@ ing experiences . &quot;
he has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a Com@@ ic @-@ novel on El@@ fri@@ ght@@ y was brought back from the early 20th century that has since been re@@ called back by nature since the beginning of the twen@@ tieth century .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like : &quot; Oh , now I have to cope with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the en@@ closure of the 301 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f held on Friday their campaign for the introduction of a new umbrella ( Rund@@ schau of Thursday ) . &quot;
&quot; even until Thursday , Major Otto Neu@@ hoff and its marketing team want to keep the logo and the slogan for Nel@@ son Art@@ z . &quot;
at the end of August there will be the highlight of the campaign a festival on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; or ? , &quot; ask the cre@@ ators of the action since yesterday on the post@@ ers at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel . &quot;
&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; they write on her yesterday on the site . &quot;
but we use this measure to attract your attention .
&quot; and to make clear that man@@ ch is better , than it seems . &quot;
&quot; basically , we are the firm conviction that we feel very well as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer to know the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; in the action there is more than &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it says furthermore . &quot;
&quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a single promise , one that gives the city an un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able . &quot;
&quot; finally , they stand in the competition with other municipalities . &quot;
a mid @-@ dig@@ it amount will cost the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f its new umbrella and the campaign .
military re@@ forming in Turkey - Erd@@ og@@ an fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August advis@@ es in Ankara of the Top Military Council ( Y@@ as ) over Pen@@ sion@@ ings and carriage in the Off@@ ici@@ on@@ sk@@ or@@ ps .
this is the same week .
at first glance a normal process .
&quot; but nothing is routine for the Turkish force , a year after the coup . &quot;
&quot; the meeting did not take place in the building of the General Staff , as formerly , but on the prime minister of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; at the Ad@@ visory authority under the pres@@ idency of the Government now also the five Vi@@ cep@@ s , as well as the Minister of Defence , Home , Justice and Foreign Affairs . &quot;
these were civilians in the Y@@ as in the over@@ number .
the government moved to the military in the military .
&quot; Minister Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the com@@ mander of the army , the bub@@ ble forces and the nav@@ y were dism@@ is@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; since the failed cou@@ p , Staat@@ sch@@ ef Erd@@ og@@ an 169 of 326 gener@@ als and Ad@@ mir@@ rors were over@@ priced . &quot;
&quot; over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of inn@@ y connections to the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erd@@ og@@ an as the wire@@ feed of the coup . &quot;
&quot; against 486 people who should immediately have been involved in the coup , will be in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the coup had Erd@@ og@@ an the overthrow of a &quot; &quot; church &quot; , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to clean the Arm@@ ed Forces &quot; completely . &quot; &quot;
but has Erd@@ og@@ an the army really under control ?
&quot; at the end of February the newspaper &quot; &quot; hur@@ t@@ yet &quot; &quot; published an article with the title &quot; &quot; discomfort in the military @-@ chief quarters . &quot;
&quot; in the general trade , there were concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; of the army , which among other things manifes@@ ts in the lifting of the head &apos;s head for Sol@@ dat@@ ors , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
the major rein@@ forces in the army and security operations are at any rate further .
in the middle of July Erd@@ og@@ an per decre@@ e was dam@@ aging another 7@@ 395 Citi@@ zen ; among them 23@@ 03 polic@@ emen and 546 soldiers .
it seemed that Erd@@ og@@ an was bur@@ dened in the military .
the gener@@ als were formerly known as the actual men of the country .
&quot; three times they call upon his role as gu@@ ardian of the mund@@ ane state . &quot;
&quot; after his election , Erd@@ og@@ an was the power of the military &apos;s step by step back , not least among the appeal of the reform@@ ism of the European Union . &quot;
&quot; former officers say , Erd@@ og@@ an is targeted a Islam@@ isation of the armed forces . &quot;
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; war@@ ned a nam@@ es@@ sian officers who sought after the coup , for fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be in a few years &quot; full of extrem@@ ists and sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; in addition , such development could not be cold . &quot;
&quot; anyway , in the alliance after the clean@@ sing doubts , there is doubt on the deployment of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; the leadership structures and operational skills are &quot; &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; say N@@ ato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for Green Card
&quot; there will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , President Donald Tru@@ mp , quoted from the media . &quot;
&quot; he sees to lower illegal immigrants in 5@@ 0,000 per year , more str@@ ingent regulations for the long @-@ term work permit and limitations for families @-@ oriented visa . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ can and supported by the President .
the bill &apos;s bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , saving wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do this by the US the way will change the way people from other countries Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent the chains of migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will come to the candidates who have speaking English , which will have the financial resources to assist themselves and show knowledge that our economy will be good , &quot; said Tru@@ mp , quoted from the American media . &quot;
ministry wants to move route for racing boo@@ sts
&quot; again , over the past few months , over the future of the race boo@@ sts have been st@@ olen - now it was supposed to go very quickly . &quot;
&quot; before the end of the year , at the mar@@ ital track , on which the tourist bus drives , will be built . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the racing sh@@ utt@@ les in the long term , the traffic of the traffic will still be started again this year . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to order the track Il@@ men@@ au track on track and to san@@ i@@ ate the country , above all for the tourism important connection , &quot; explained transportation sec@@ retary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot;
the cost of the over@@ hau@@ ling of the route is about 2.5 million euros .
&quot; from this amount , the country takes 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , based on its basis the shuttle will also be ordered in the future by the country , will currently be final , stated S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the Ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen Bahn as the operator were already one of the technical details already .
&quot; these are the timetable , tra@@ ded the vehicles and the quality standards , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
&quot; with that , the racing shuttle will be ordered on December 2017 . &quot;
the racing platform is an especially popular train station between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ ers@@ .
&quot; over the past few months , during the course of a pilot organization , whether the track has been used by sufficient many people to order them again in the future . &quot;
the route is also in parts strongly b@@ ail .
the rise of sex robots are real and we should worry
&quot; just as you thought it could not yet be crazy , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots . &quot;
yes .
Sex @-@ robots are currently a great thing .
&quot; recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible robot@@ ics ) ( FR@@ R ) report a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years . &quot;
&quot; according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , em@@ eri@@ ted Professor for Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must start to take their ascent seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the ey@@ e@@ colour of the robot , its shape of the nipp@@ le and choose the type of fingers . &quot;
&quot; people make themselves funny but the companies supply a lot of it , and we will still get much more frequent to see , &quot; said Mr Shar@@ key on the release of his new report . &quot;
modern Sex@@ pu@@ ffs have developed from their infl@@ atable partners with a si@@ lic@@ ate skin that feels warm an@@ feels - with aware of human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can also adjust his robot according to its beliefs &quot; , &quot; and select everything from the ey@@ e@@ colour of the robot to the type or colour of his fingers . &quot;
&quot; but it is even more disturb@@ ing , as many robots have the &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; that would be a Step@@ ford woman pro@@ gressi@@ vely . &quot;
modern Sex@@ pu@@ ffs have developed into robots with a si@@ lic@@ on skin .
&quot; the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows for example to adapt its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they are appe@@ aling as to do so , for example . &quot;
&quot; and then there is still the True Compan@@ ion developed , pro@@ xy Gold sex robots with pre @-@ program@@ med personalities as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which con@@ veys the impression of sh@@ red@@ ness and &quot; Wild Wendy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ uro@@ us &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ ous gold has a personality , which is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; war@@ ms the site of True Compan@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; so she likes what you like , and you don &apos;t like what you do not like , etc . &quot;
she also has her m@@ oods over the course of the day - really like real people !
&quot; you can be tired , fixed on conversation or it can be &quot; in mood &quot; ! &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are many disturb@@ ing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least , because they re@@ placing real human relationships - but the dis@@ rup@@ tive female properties that passes a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( is called here : conflic@@ ting ) Far@@ rah is going on a quiet place . &quot;
on his web page True Compan@@ ion Recycling xy with a vibr@@ ator but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no correc@@ tions ? &quot; &quot; it is on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fetish or simply just another sex . &quot;
&quot; their birth and growing refin@@ ement focus on a little dar@@ ker and deeper into our culture , to retreat from the ide@@ al of gender equality towards a desire for sex with sub@@ ordination as optional addition . &quot;
&quot; most men will of course hold any sex robots , and while the FR@@ R are increasing their rising popularity , they still remain meth@@ odology on the edge of the consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what to le@@ ak from the edge zones , in terms of the spirit of time , in which we live , very instruc@@ tive . &quot;
and many people are not strange or til@@ ting until they have the free market this permission .
&quot; there is however a certain over@@ cutting that these highly evolved sex robots are at a time where the rights of women worldwide are threatened , in which the White House has a president who has pra@@ ised to have women sexually attacked . &quot;
the most aw@@ ful aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s Tale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Mag@@ d &apos;@@ ) are not the graphical images that conc@@ eal the body and the spread eyes but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a le@@ ap but in the moment this does not feel like a great le@@ ap .
the goal behind these sex robots is to establish a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with porno@@ star propor@@ tions ) .
they want to feel that they feel threatened by the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot;
you can not separate from her companion or just go away .
&quot; they have no placement or a background story , nothing , which may be anno@@ yed on independence or anything that could inter@@ f@@ ere the imagination of dead sub@@ jug@@ ation . &quot;
otherwise expressed : they are counter@@ part slaves .
or to express it in the re@@ alizing of 2017 : maid
Tru@@ mp@@ s wide performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the in@@ scription of the healthy human mind
&quot; it has become a bin@@ ge of the Tru@@ mp era that political divisions , who have pol@@ ari@@ zed the US voters even families in small @-@ format . &quot;
&quot; around Christmas and Ern@@ ted@@ ank@@ fest was in the US newspapers with advice on how to enter the horror of Tru@@ mp relatives . &quot;
we rig@@ orous us all alleg@@ edly to let our filter@@ ing bub@@ bles .
&quot; less noticed is the power of Tru@@ mp@@ s , families together . &quot;
&quot; I mentioned this because my cous@@ ins who lives in Chicago , who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , who has visited this week in New York . &quot;
she remin@@ ded me that the unity can have a powerful effect against a common enemy .
&quot; with Tru@@ mp in the White House is everyone who knows them , including the Republi@@ can relationship with which she had fought for decades , suddenly and quite peculi@@ ar on the same side . &quot;
&quot; around the dining table , this is certainly a good thing , but it falls me in another connection that this will also bring significant risks with itself . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the cle@@ aring effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push us all to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tru@@ mp , we refer to the gr@@ us@@ eless opportunity that us will no longer be rep@@ aired to us of one day . &quot;
&quot; however , there is still a terri@@ fying long @-@ time scenario , in the Tru@@ mp re@@ public@@ ans of the right wing &quot; &quot; norm@@ alized , which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards suddenly as a word &apos; term . &quot;
&quot; I find myself today from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s urian version of the fall , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax statement saw ) - both in comparison to Tru@@ mp in fact a very mild criminal off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; if Tru@@ mp goes , the next candidate of Repub@@ lic@@ ans must only be spiritual to qualify as un@@ measur@@ able improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my cous@@ ins was in the city , we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park , the largest of the kar@@ uss@@ ells of the New York City department , and the best three dollars that one can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the Fi@@ ber@@ glas designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are kn@@ ur@@ able and the animals are turning to look full of fear about their own shoul@@ ders - extremely fin@@ ster and the cli@@ matic music gives this to a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many Kl@@ isch@@ ees of a city dis@@ ap@@ point : the views of high buildings become old , the Sky@@ lines are becoming familiar to offer much excitement and the reality of the city will not do justice . &quot;
&quot; five years later , and I still didn &apos;t think about the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss Cottage - the topics @-@ pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not counted - but a big round@@ about in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; however , the Central Park @-@ carousel is still a strange magical experience , as here two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ years can go on it and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have rate the carousel , I would have given him the full score , but luck@@ ily nobody asked this . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee shop on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to get the review with a 15 % dr@@ ill for the same - this to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this does not only lead to a slow@@ ing of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also practi@@ sing pressure on the server to put personality into a situation in which no need is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store stood exc@@ di@@ ous , while I was tired of experience to submit my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us comes to the hospital in prison
Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time .
&quot; last year he was brought to hospital for the treatment of cuts in his hand , he suffered the prison authorities according to a fall in his cell . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us was condem@@ ned to an appeal against an appeal against an appeal against a appeal against a call of state attor@@ neys .
&quot; he dead@@ ly ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of Valentine , by giving them several times through a door of the toil@@ et@@ ine in his house in Pret@@ oria on it . &quot;

software update for diesel vehicles : what the people concerned now need to know
how exactly will the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in action ?
the most important questions and answers in an overview .
&quot; at the diesel summit , BMW , Daim@@ ler , Opel and the VW Group software updates for a total of around 5,@@ 3 million cars . &quot;
they are supposed to improve the gas @-@ behavior of cars of emis@@ sion classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ diesel or worse are taken out of it .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in from ACE Auto Club Europe gives re@@ ass@@ ess@@ ments :
is the new action compul@@ s@@ ory ?
no , the tra@@ ded software updates are optional . &quot;
&quot; the oblig@@ atory updates previously apply only to the vehicles , the che@@ mel@@ software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
their retro@@ fit has arranged the power@@ train station ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; the manufacturers have announced a first implementation in the coming months , but still not an exact date . &quot;
Daim@@ ler has communic@@ ated to write every person concerned .
&quot; if a inspection is pr@@ one , it will be done in its context . &quot;
how long can the deep@@ ening machines move ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
the regulations from the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; for we have seen vol@@ un@@ tar@@ ily , the auto mer@@ gers act on the subject of environment so far . &quot;
how long will the update take ?
the change@@ over itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
Tim@@ ers could be able to get an appointment .
&quot; what do motor@@ ists do not drive a car from BMW , Daim@@ ler , Opel and the VW Group ? &quot;
the ace betra@@ ys to wait .
&quot; probably foreign manufacturers would add , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
threat@@ ens a solid price drop of Euro @-@ 4 @-@ cars ?
the ACE is fear@@ ed .
&quot; but even in the regions , where driving a ban . &quot;
there has been no value for previous diesel in rural areas until now .
the ACE can be found with a sale yet .

Kennedy Awards Gal@@ a is one of the gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ awarded under President Tru@@ mp promises to become political .
one of the winners will not come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) receives one of the most sought after awards by the renowned Kennedy Center .
&quot; known as the cultural institution on Thursday , belong in this year also singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ on@@ el Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) as well as the chore@@ ograph@@ in Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) . &quot;

&quot; traditionally , U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp will hold a reception and compete with his wife Mel@@ ania . &quot;
the winners of the Progressive TV series of winners announced that it is already announced to rel@@ inqu@@ ish the participation in the Gal@@ a .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; this Presidency has decided to fully negl@@ ect the arts and human rights - even depri@@ ving them the means - and not bur@@ dened me . &quot;
&quot; the 59 @-@ year Est@@ ef@@ an stressed , she will use the conversation with Tru@@ mp to view their view . &quot;
&quot; after the former president John F. Kennedy , Kennedy @-@ Centre is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital . &quot;

we make the city vibran@@ t
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes next year in R@@ ente . &quot;
&quot; however , the spot is already written - suitable applic@@ ants are still present . &quot;
for 31 years now W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
and the work makes him still great fun as he con@@ veys the press .
&quot; he reports of varied , but also challenging tasks that are waiting for his successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , he wonder@@ ed that so far no application will fulfil the requirement . &quot;
the city is looking for an architect or construction engineer at the next time .
this is to be done - considering the regular cancellation @-@ fri@@ ction - still enough time for a revision .
&quot; as ha@@ l@@ ach , for the administration of the association as a sig@@ h regulatory authorities , the applic@@ ant must indicate the appropriate specifications . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city definitely .
&quot; if they cannot fill in this , they would have to drive citizens to advice until Off@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; but civil war , the city and himself is important , says W@@ acker , who reported by a good operating sk@@ ill@@ ma as well as good mood between authority and citizens . &quot;
&quot; over 30 years in office , some major projects have accum@@ ulated on the wo@@ unds with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city experience &quot; , &quot; he is sure about the construction office and its employees . &quot;
&quot; but also in the future , varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ arrangement of the former Hu@@ cl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the decline of the decline . &quot;
the Kin@@ ci@@ bridge between B@@ oll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed even the Sta@@ di@@ on@@ ation is still the subject .
&quot; the latter alone will hit with some 1.5 million euros to be@@ ech , &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; W@@ acker &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
Georgi@@ an is available for a Stadt@@ bau@@ masters of large play@@ room .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own building yard and garden@@ er can be quite flexi@@ bly responded to it .
&quot; one can move a lot , &quot; so W@@ acker , and the design of the green plants will often be mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; as the old town as an ensemble under monument protection stands , be it important to have an eye for that which rein@@ car@@ vers &quot; when re@@ constructions is approved , stres@@ ses the den@@ ver Stadt@@ bau@@ meister . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister contributes high responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is construc@@ tor , &quot; at the end everything goes down here about my table . &quot;
&quot; in support and coordination , he can count on many years of employees : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been here for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Tief@@ bau ) has been for 15 years now . &quot;
&quot; also that its successor remains for a long time , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; we are looking for someone who really want to be identified and stay with the place . &quot;
&quot; because continuity is not only important for a good operating company , but also for the further formation of the city . &quot;
&quot; who want Roland W@@ acker be@@ er@@ ben , should be able to obtain information from the city of Has@@ l@@ ach , a closed study as a diplom@@ engineer or a Bachelor &apos;s degree in architecture and have good expertise in the areas of building and construction services . &quot;
&quot; the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister@@ amt stand high and deep @-@ scale , construction planning , gr@@ under@@ ing affairs , administration of urban li@@ abilities , urban architecture with Bau@@ hof and city nur@@ series , as well as sub@@ stitution authorities , including monuments . &quot;
bike on lines thrown : south @-@ track closed
&quot; according to police , the far @-@ known activity had hi@@ red the blue bicycle from the railway station in the area of Le@@ ob@@ an Street ( B@@ 116 ) to the lines . &quot;
these were so strongly damaged that the her@@ ann@@ ant frei@@ ght must be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go from two male offen@@ ders and look for the offspring after them .
near the Tat@@ i there were witnesses of a ro@@ sar@@ ot@@ ers wheelchair and a bike driver .
&quot; this goes far beyond an Laus@@ alp@@ enh@@ reich , &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot;
the or the perpet@@ rators would have taken themselves in great danger and also in danger of traffic .
&quot; in addition to the damage to the L@@ ok and the plant , as well as the late @-@ minute drive and the cost of rail traffic , could also be even the x @-@ ray of railway @-@ customers to the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; be out of a &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; total , the spok@@ es@@ person said . &quot;
the damage was again fixed on Fri@@ day@@ afternoon , rail traffic on the south @-@ route could be guided without disabilities . &quot;
&quot; almost ten person@@ ages were fre@@ ed for a day afternoon , two of them consider correspondence . &quot;
&quot; goods received not out , but they had delay . &quot;
according to Ö@@ BB @-@ speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be replaced around 200 meters above .
isol@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help IB@@ D ( infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory diseases ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound for your diges@@ tion like a night@@ mare .
&quot; but a new study claims just the opposite : a diet , which is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , the symptoms of patients with infl@@ amed diseases . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able state that in the US roughly 1.3 million and in the UK 300.@@ 000 concerns , the stomach and blo@@ ods , recur@@ ring or blo@@ ody di@@ arr@@ ings , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; while the affected is normally come to avoid meat and dairy products to alle@@ vi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers found researchers at the Wash@@ ington@@ er University , that the essential amino acid Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; the leading researchers , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells at the intest@@ ine have pat@@ rol , to ensure that dam@@ aging micro@@ bes that hide themselves in the food , not penet@@ rate into the body . &quot;
&quot; cells that are able to infl@@ amm@@ ations infl@@ amm@@ ations , are compens@@ ated of cells that protect the tolerance and protect the body without sensitive tissues . &quot;
&quot; if the balance tend to be too far towards infl@@ amm@@ ation , it can result in a infl@@ amm@@ able intest@@ inal disease . &quot;
&quot; in experiments , it was established that a kind of tolerance stimul@@ ating immun@@ isation in mi@@ ce occurs , which carry out a certain bacter@@ ium in their initi@@ ates . &quot;
and the bacter@@ ium is needed Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the buil@@ ders of proteins - to view the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacter@@ ial species - Lac@@ tob@@ ac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ oms and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mi@@ ce in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an on tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han rich nutrition exc@@ eeded , less un@@ oral intest@@ inal li@@ mbs , if the same system is also accessible with people . &quot;
&quot; the post@@ doctor@@ al din Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an under@@ sought a kind of immune cell , which had tolerance , as she found that a group of academic powers had such cells , but another group of this same tribe but was not accommod@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; it susp@@ ected that the difference had to do with the intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ oma of mi@@ ce - the community of bacteria , viruses and mushrooms , which usually live in the stomach @-@ intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; the intest@@ inal of the mi@@ ce were DNA @-@ sequ@@ encing and there were six bacter@@ ial species found in the mi@@ ce with the immune cells , but without them missing . &quot;
&quot; mi@@ ce were re@@ ared in a ster@@ ile environment so that they failed to have a intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ om and they did not have developed these kinds of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells . &quot;
&quot; to understand how the bacteria developed on the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i left in a liquid and over@@ carried small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ri@@ pe immune cells that were isolated from the mi@@ ce . &quot;
the immune cells developed to the toler@@ anced cells .
&quot; as the active component of the liquid was puri@@ fied , it proved to be a by @-@ product of the Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han Met@@ abol@@ ism that is known as the In@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ Mil@@ es@@ c acid . &quot;
&quot; when the researchers dou@@ bles the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the for@@ age of mi@@ ce double , the number of such cells rose by approximately 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ ro were hal@@ ved , the number of cells rose by half . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes bar@@ rag@@ an declared that people have the same toler@@ ating cells such as mi@@ ce , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i are protected in our stomach @-@ intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han side @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i , the cells in humans develop as with mi@@ ce , but Def@@ ects in gen@@ es in relation to Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with kid@@ ney disease . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote , since these cells infl@@ amm@@ ations on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; potentially , high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an extension of these populations . &quot;

&quot; however , MAT@@ IC had been excluded from the preparation @-@ Asia @-@ tour of the blues and made only 45 minutes , what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho had to improve that he had to improve before starting the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a geni@@ us in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him to be ready earlier than later .

&quot; three of four to get , thank you to the association , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier , if you get four of four , but they have given great effort . &quot;

&quot; new draft for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; as the wind revol@@ ves : as Sig@@ mar Gabriel nor SPD boss , was the moment social @-@ democratic prime minister before elections always with a certain concern to Berlin . &quot;
&quot; merely exp@@ elled from the party central , only no counter @-@ wind from the coven@@ ant - so lau@@ ght@@ ened the most important wish of the elect@@ oral campaigns . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz , the party has led the fundamentally changed . &quot;
&quot; since then , the staff will observe from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ house with growing horror the events in the SPD @-@ ruled state capit@@ als . &quot;
&quot; what Schulz has got from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described in the approach since the beginning of the year . &quot;
there were underground .
and that one after the other .
the Con@@ federation CD@@ U looks after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; this once shows once more : red @-@ green can simply be trusted , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber the Edi@@ tors network Germany ( R@@ N@@ D ) . &quot;
the surprising fac@@ tions of a Green MEPs took over the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SD@@ P ) in a difficult crisis .
five months before the day @-@ election lost its red @-@ green coalition with its one @-@ cast majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ federal leader Michael Kell@@ ner has requested the tr@@ un@@ chy Nieder@@ s@@ äch@@ s@@ ische Green @-@ Euro MPs encouraged to return their mandate .
the over@@ head of the CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the elect@@ or@@ will@@ power .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ ables must immediately return her mandate , &quot; said the federal leader and election of the Green Network Germany ( R@@ N@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; this must not be true , yet it is still a SPD c@@ ant fighting , than in the morning the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ ban was achieved in the convention . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD @-@ Minister of Lower Saxony , stands after crossing the green of the El@@ ke T@@ west to CD@@ U without its own ruling class . &quot;
it is the pro@@ visional highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD @-@ state associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the mis@@ ery started with the un@@ expected defeat at the Saarland election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , so@@ othing the comrades of the time . &quot;
after the land elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen will be everything different .
this was then also - and it was all significantly worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into pig@@ ments , the Düsseldorf @-@ pl@@ ough@@ ed the party gl@@ att around . &quot;
comrades cut down the comrades in the weeks after that .
&quot; then when they had just had new courage , the G @-@ 20 Summit came from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him the next lows .
&quot; Mayor of O@@ la@@ f Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD @-@ chief chief , lost in that weekend his Nim@@ bus , because he sa@@ ke in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city burned . &quot;
&quot; and because he did so quite wrong in the crisis of crisis , so that they can do wrong . &quot;
&quot; since then , Sch@@ olz has been fighting for its political survival . &quot;
so now even Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; because of the VW dealer and its role in the Super@@ visory Board of the Super@@ visory Board , the Nieder@@ s@@ äch@@ s@@ ische Prime Minister has been in criticism of a long time ago . &quot;
mi@@ ce Re@@ quire@@ ments were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps this is why he tried to put more and stronger in the coven@@ ant past weeks . &quot;
&quot; the ambi@@ tion of the former Citi@@ zen of Hanover , his power in Berlin , remained not hidden in the surroundings of Martin Schulz . &quot;
they let him give him as they promised the Party of Wei@@ l a stabili@@ zation of the party .
&quot; now , the exact opposite could occur . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l meets the party &apos;s internal constra@@ ints , is basically no fault . &quot;
and Schulz was not at all .
un@@ installing the comrades therefore endeav@@ our to keep their own ranks .
&quot; their wrath is aimed at the Gre@@ ens , and here especially on the tr@@ ac@@ ulous parliament@@ arians in T@@ ilt . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , such as woman tick their own career fil@@ ming about the interests of all the others , &quot; says Matthias Mier@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Bund@@ est@@ ag@@ sf@@ ction , the General Network Germany ( R@@ N@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; Ms. T@@ ach@@ ys has not been elected to the parliament due to their person as a direct channel , but over the state of the Dutch countryside to the Parliament , so the Nieder@@ s@@ äch@@ s@@ ische desc@@ endant continues . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns to their mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Chief of the SPD member states , indic@@ ted a &quot; un@@ democratic man@@ eu@@ ver . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the elect@@ or@@ w@@ ille four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan Wei@@ l to Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Nieder@@ s@@ äch@@ s@@ ische SPD as a sh@@ re@@ an @-@ election in the bund@@ le @-@ election , the R@@ N@@ D . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now , the personal care@@ er@@ ect of a future CD@@ U MEPs said the W@@ ah@@ e@@ result , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he called for clear the back@@ grounds .
I want to know if there has been more or it continued to continue the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
funding for the town@@ center III
who want to be immersed in the years to get the house can soon get support from the country .
&quot; above , Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representative st@@ eg Stadt@@ development on Wednesday in received . &quot;
at the start of the information event Sch@@ ind@@ ler gave once again a review of the so far .
since 1991 it was given in sensitive refurb@@ ishment .
&quot; at that time , in the refurb@@ ishment I from 1991 to 2004 , the land of Baden @-@ Württemberg , have taken over two thirds of the funding . &quot;
&quot; in the reconstruction of II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dies was still at 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for sh@@ ind@@ ler , the &quot; &quot; success project &quot; &quot; - it was ultimately important to promote the internal development , and not only new construction areas . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , you have received the information from the Council of the Council on May 4 , that there will be a san@@ itar@@ y@@ ance III . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ total sub@@ missions 833 333 euros , of which would be more than 500 000 Euros from the country , the rest of the community . &quot;
how is a recovery area now ?
&quot; you will continue to examine so scar@@ let , examine where the &quot; really old &quot; homes are . &quot;
&quot; it also play a role , whether in the planned territory was interest in all interest . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the planning @-@ limits could also be shi@@ fted again . &quot;
&quot; the pi@@ er spent on Wednesday night @-@ evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; cellar presented the contents of the federal states &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; , &quot; in whose frame the renov@@ ations were then performed . &quot;
core of the program are re@@ vit@@ alization of inner cities that improve living and labour conditions and maintenance and expansion of infrastructure .
&quot; the measures would be object @-@ related , that is said per plot . &quot;
the reconstruction area would eventually be defined as a stat@@ ute .
the auth@@ orization period for funding runs from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026 .
&quot; until September this year , however , only once again the invent@@ ory will be carried out , as part of those who will get a ques@@ tionn@@ aire to the ques@@ tionn@@ aire . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the proposition is scheduled to take place as possible during the coming year . &quot;
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann explained that every commun@@ e will carry out the def@@ endants .
it is about to evaluate the urban @-@ planning ab@@ norm@@ alities and decide when san@@ e@@ ates and to what extent .
there will be a note on the property for the particular property .
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again gradually , and make a picture of the location he spoke . &quot;
Got@@ zel stressed the key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants .
&quot; therefore , there will be ques@@ tionnaires that will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow ques@@ tionn@@ aire is the &quot; &quot; building and real estate &quot; , &quot; with which it is among other things about the sensu@@ al condition and the refurb@@ ishment views . &quot;
&quot; in the gray ques@@ tionn@@ aire , the &quot; budget and housing &quot; , &quot; can be made up to size , distribution and residents of a residential area . &quot;
&quot; the blue &quot; &quot; operating &quot; &quot; is only to fill when in the building business rooms . &quot;
&quot; however , to be noted , Got@@ zel pointed out that an accomplished ques@@ tionn@@ aire was not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
new construction measures are also not eligible .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler emphas@@ ized that the distribution of funding for the &quot; wind@@ j@@ aco@@ ck &quot; feature - who first comes , ad@@ verse first . &quot;

&quot; a British inv@@ entor is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that he can open his front door , to enter his office and even start with a manual movement . &quot;

the adver@@ t of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
&quot; the decision of the White House , a nav@@ y heli@@ copter comes to the South Law@@ n for an event that lifts the American manufacturing last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the statements of the military that have been left to the TIME magazine , up to 24.@@ 000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programmes . &quot;
President Donald Tru@@ mp ; Vice President Mike P@@ ence and conduc@@ tion officials from the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states .
the heli@@ copter heli@@ copter was issued next to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire@@ man from Wis@@ con@@ sin and a for@@ kli@@ ft from Mississi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; the military office of the White House demanded the presence of the heli@@ cop@@ ters in a frag@@ mentary order or F@@ RA@@ GO , barely 36 hours before the heli@@ copter of the Marine Hel@@ i@@ copter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit , which is responsible for the operation of the heli@@ cop@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted to be aware that you are aware of it because it is an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the Com@@ man@@ de@@ ur of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 at the eve of the event of his su@@ peri@@ ors , the Dep@@ uty Marin@@ ekom@@ man@@ de@@ ur for aviation . &quot;
&quot; the message showed that the heli@@ copter comes up on 17 July at 7 p.m. on the South Law@@ n for the event at 15 p.m. , and so long stayed until the lawn between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening . &quot;
&quot; the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be del@@ ayed , due to the limitation of the service hours a second team needed for the return flight . &quot;
the original air stat@@ utes was during the event when the heli@@ cop@@ ters during the event was on the ground during the time on the floor .
&quot; from the recording provided records , not clearly stated whether a second flight Stat@@ utes was necessary . &quot;
&quot; H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal states , state @-@ owned property for political purposes . &quot;
dat@@ as@@ ets show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked whether the event could hurt the purpose .
&quot; a question that we asked , was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch A@@ cts , and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the com@@ mander . &quot;
&quot; sound , as if you are closed , &quot; said , the Dep@@ uty Commander . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; was described by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot;
but also official events have political thig@@ h .
&quot; at the event , the president gave an imp@@ etus to reform of the health reform that was under@@ way in the Sen@@ ate , and it pro@@ pag@@ ate the efforts to implement the governance regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the plane , which is known as Marine One or Air Force One , for politically favorable purposes is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot;
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
&quot; however , their use only for a photo @-@ operation is un@@ common . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp led to an investigation in February , as the presidential plane in Melbourne , Florida , Tax@@ i@@ services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that describe themselves about the use of the pres@@ idency of its predec@@ essor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states will be produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the Vice @-@ Secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 Occup@@ ations often lead training courses in the area around Washington and in South Law@@ n through , in order to reset the US president in the White House with precision cen@@ tim@@ eters . &quot;
&quot; as the Tru@@ mp in early July at the G@@ 20 Summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 led in the White House 58 practice of exercise . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event en@@ umer@@ ated in the training requirement for the month , said an official . &quot;
heli@@ copter units are also flo@@ ating in addition 11 hours on this day for &quot; non @-@ pres@@ sion@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; the White House said , that the tax@@ pay@@ ers were the burden for none of the other re@@ alizing that were presented at the event . &quot;
&quot; a speaker of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said , the company was not involved in bringing the heli@@ copter on the South Law@@ n . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not hold Bud@@ get@@ ary records for the presidential , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ fen of the U.S. Defence Ministry for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D replacement for the V@@ H @-@ 3D however is 24.@@ 380 USD per aircraft . &quot;
records of the unit took the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Cor@@ ps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual cost of the operation of the heli@@ cop@@ ters are far below this rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers are on the basis of estimates for the issu@@ ing operations , is most mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funding . &quot;
&quot; according to a margin from the year 2015 , the refund for Do@@ D does not include Personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract . &quot;
&quot; at that time the former press pre@@ aching of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , the use of heli@@ cop@@ ters for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present this week things that are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the federal state were very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I am assum@@ ing that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent . &quot;
&quot; and I think as most Americans we are all proud of the heli@@ copter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked in@@ rel@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is appropriate to emphas@@ ise this . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether Tru@@ mp was inter@@ viewed with the heli@@ copter , when he prayed to the South Law@@ n for the event , but he sat down into the landing stage of a fire@@ man . &quot;
&quot; in the White House , Tru@@ mp spoke to representatives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and scher@@ sed with the media about his own fleet of company products . &quot;
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very good , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

&quot; even the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels were fo@@ ols against the US bre@@ ach . &quot;

&quot; nevertheless , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , so the official stat@@ ement of oil production . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tru@@ mp would have to aw@@ aken sanctions even by executive order to life . &quot;

Rolle back@@ wards : the city presents 46 fl@@ aws
the city organized the K@@ ita @-@ lunch table .
with fixed contact partners for the children and a assignment to the team .
in the urban areas of children the clock is revers@@ ed .
&quot; in September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld is taking over the food supply in the urban children &apos;s office facilities ( kit@@ as ) again . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , Dep@@ uty Chairman of the Youth Movement , this is a good news : &quot; we all have very hon@@ ored . &quot;
cooked will continue to be out of house : a Cater@@ er takes over this task and delivers fresh water @-@ cool@@ ed .
&quot; the city operates in the Kre@@ felder area 46 children &apos;s workshops , in 44 , the children are getting a warm meal . &quot;
&quot; in the past couple of year , 2800 children at the tables , and the need is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; by now they eat not only children , the 45 week@@ ns are served , in the K@@ ita for lunch , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour care , if children stay up to 14 hours . &quot;
&quot; 46 Parti@@ tur@@ ers have served from 1 September kitchen service : you are warm@@ ed food , supplement it to sal@@ ad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tion@@ aries the meal individually , giving the meal individually , wash@@ es and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are firmly assigned to a cl@@ ita , says Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot;
the size - there are two @-@ group as well as se@@ eng@@ aging facilities - decide on the scope of the scope .
&quot; the kitchen heroes belong now to the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; thus , they are much more integrated and it is easier for the kit@@ chens to implement , ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot;
for this reason it is about eating a healthy diet and cooking .
children should help to prepare the food .
the direct connection of the ch@@ ew@@ ish@@ ness of the team is there sense .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not ever @-@ changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the clean@@ sing of the K@@ ita @-@ spaces - even so far the task of the kitchen forces - will be done in the future of special cleaning personnel .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen also the charm , which they have turned in the cost @-@ comparison between peculi@@ ar and foreign task for the city as the most economical , it is of the press office . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 sub @-@ time forces are newly al@@ located . &quot;
&quot; but these hours fall on around 750 people in the educ@@ ating area , not so strong into weight , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;

G@@ MB @-@ concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie @-@ Fabrik in Glas@@ gow
a trade union would like to make a trade union with managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie over the long @-@ term commitment to production in their work in Glas@@ gow .
G@@ MB Scotland said to weig@@ h the company on the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the plant , besides other products of Hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea Kek@@ se . &quot;
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pl@@ adi@@ s said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in the last few years .
he added that employees and trade union representatives were experienced as the first as their activities would change .
&quot; in a letter to the branch of the company called G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s to , &quot; concerns concerns , that the financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines are not being promoted . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ Organis@@ ator Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can gain no clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , concerns our members . &quot;
generations of families have worked here and labour forces focus strongly on the local community and the Greater Glas@@ gow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social aler@@ ship . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and in the background of Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising life of life and the chronic production of Glas@@ gow , the eastern end of Glas@@ gow urgently needed a floral production of Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a speaker of Pl@@ adi@@ s said : &quot; &quot; the Fili@@ all@@ ei@@ ter at T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to that we value the continuous engagement with employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; we had two months ago a regular meetings with employees and G@@ MB representatives from T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we talked to the employees that we are working as all companies , who regularly review our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to be competitive . &quot;
&quot; they added : &quot; in recent years , we have invested more than 5 million pounds , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site and completely on . if our business operations are changing at the location , the employees and their trade unions will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PSG war@@ ned three years ago in front of N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the page of La Liga likes their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Germain will not be noti@@ fied in their persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar , after having been given an offer of £ 189 million to det@@ ach its free admission , but they have war@@ ned to Barcelona three years before the world war ? &quot;
&quot; the sens@@ ational approach has raised the Trans@@ fer@@ window in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record around more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba last season for 89 million pounds to Manchester United . &quot;
&quot; after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar is for the first player in the world and for the highest paid professional sports@@ men of the world . PSG offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is angry about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced its way out outside , although a source is given near the Catal@@ ans state , that the club always has given his best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but the football world was war@@ ned three years ago by the PSG @-@ president in front of this prospect ?
&quot; as Manchester City 2014 interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for each association who wants to sign one of the best players from PSG . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact her players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players in themselves , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have exc@@ eeded this line , with the Spanish society in the beginning of this summer interest in the PSG @-@ mid @-@ Central and Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it was clear that they would not allow it to the International from Italy under any circumstances under any circumstances , and Barcelona could sense the consequences of this interest by offering one of their price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;

&quot; the driver of the opposite side of passenger , a Mercedes Benz , had covered a truck and continued its way without worry about the traffic . &quot;
&quot; it may be good according to the uncertainty , that the Mer@@ c@@ edes@@ co had not noticed the accident at all . &quot;

the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report about the ab@@ norm@@ alities dism@@ is@@ sed Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the author and histori@@ ans Michael H@@ es@@ emann .
the final report on abuse at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen is continuing for discussions .
&quot; we are church &quot; &quot; We are church &quot; , &quot; stated after publication compared to the Deutsche Press Agency , he anticipated by the former Reg@@ ens@@ burger Bishop and today Card@@ inal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year brother of the Canadian Benedi@@ ct XVI , an exc@@ use . &quot;
&quot; it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church , if Müller and ru@@ atz@@ inger would be deeply expressed by their own om@@ is@@ sions or their at that time incorrect evaluation of the processes . &quot;
&quot; the Vatican &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano &quot; , &quot; on the other hand , cri@@ tici@@ zed that in reporting about violence in the dom@@ sp@@ atzen with &quot; two measure &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the gri@@ ps in Reg@@ ensburg , no one that would have to be prevented &quot; sh@@ am@@ eful and sh@@ am@@ eful acts &quot; &quot; that would be pun@@ ished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; level medi@@ al manip@@ ulation &quot; , &quot; so the author of medi@@ al Man@@ ip@@ ulation &quot; , &quot; so the author of medi@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , histori@@ ans and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics committees . &quot;
&quot; the habit , the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of everyday life experience and prepar@@ es public opinion to keep normal for normal , writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
also the stin Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is said in an interview with the Bayer@@ ischer Rund@@ funk : &apos; you would like to go on the church and this is a consolidated catch .
&quot; moreover , she pointed out that in their youth &quot; &quot; be@@ ats have been a very normal ped@@ agog@@ ical means &quot; to be with friends , as I was one . &quot;
&quot; it is unfair , to apply today &apos;s standards to earlier decades because the world have changed . &quot;
in connection with reports of the abuse of ab@@ norm@@ alities often also pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; completely wrong , author and histori@@ ans Michael H@@ es@@ emann , who was translated with R@@ atz@@ inger the reminder &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; ( in 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says H@@ es@@ emann , &quot; for all that had nothing to do with him , &quot; he adds the results of the thesis . &quot;
what exactly stands in the 440 @-@ page report that has presented by the di@@ oc@@ um Reg@@ ensburg with clari@@ fication of Ulrich Weber
&quot; a total of 547 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and early 1990s , with high resolution , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen sexually ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , it is called to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Reg@@ ensburg : &quot; in summary , so that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases shapes physically and psychological violence have been applied . &quot;
&quot; especially with high emotional on@@ ality , the punishment of the students could also be veh@@ em@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in contrast to numerous other def@@ ects that many victims are estim@@ ating the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even combine positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; in an interview , H@@ es@@ emann , why the Final Report about the mis@@ use of the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger of his opinion is dischar@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; Mr H@@ es@@ emann , the 440 @-@ Pages report on the &quot; &quot; inci@@ dents of violence &quot; &quot; of the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; is a contra@@ dic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; for one stand many students his &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for the other , he also appears as a ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ ker and perf@@ ection@@ ist that has been tan@@ gible , when a domain name musi@@ cally led no top performance . &quot;
how do you evaluate as his bio@@ grapher to this final report ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : if you read the trouble and reads all over the 440 pages long from the front up to the back , one has to ask for the name of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger at all in it . &quot;
&quot; they are just eight sides dedicated to it , and he will be clearly spoken by any sus@@ pic@@ ion of the medi@@ ators or fellow @-@ workers in the terrible cases sexual abuse . &quot;
&quot; also , the violence against the school is also based outside of its active sphere . &quot;
&quot; you can throw him any place , too late , or not have taken the first assu@@ mp@@ tions not seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the dom@@ sp@@ ells @-@ design , on which he was acting , was perceived by virtually all respon@@ dents than - so literally - &quot; salvation &quot; , &quot; &quot; Heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; thus the vast majority of his pupils Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also describes it as &quot; warm @-@ heart@@ ed , &quot; &quot; sincer@@ ely , &quot; &quot; sincer@@ ely , &quot; &quot; sincer@@ ely , &quot; &quot; knowled@@ geable , &quot; &quot; knowled@@ geable , &quot; &quot; knowled@@ geable , bis@@ cuits and Bon@@ b@@ ons were buried and &quot; always by grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority worth about his perf@@ ection@@ ism and its high emotional on@@ ality that also led to W@@ ut@@ aus@@ ages .
&quot; that he did not only bow@@ ed with chairs and bow@@ ed on the ground , but also the keys and too well @-@ shared guys to the hair or ears , he himself de@@ pl@@ ed up years ago , deeply regret and exc@@ used for it . &quot;
&quot; however , to his honor , however , must be said that such surveys in the frag@@ ment period , the 1960@@ s and 1970@@ s have been widely used , in parents like with teachers . &quot;
do you also know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think of each of us who was born in 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also have seen this in a world @-@ world school , a state @-@ Gymnasium . &quot;
&quot; compared to what it actually goes to this report , namely the dep@@ end@@ able sexual abuse and non @-@ violence at the school , are the liber@@ ally bag@@ at@@ elles . &quot;
&quot; you ask yourself whether it is not rather with his reputation , and his role as brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI . to do , that many media has just crossed him . &quot;
&quot; on the Bav@@ arian Pope , many who have never understood him , still more icy . &quot;
but the truth is : the report ent@@ last@@ et Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every sense !
&quot; in the media , in connection with the report was reported much about the subject of mis@@ use at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will also be put into a load by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the Final Report as well as any contrac@@ ting or fellow @-@ understanding in terms of sexual abuse ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : very clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual vic@@ tors claims to have become familiar to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; I never forget to talk to my father or mother , said a suffer@@ er dep@@ uty for the others , &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing . &quot;
the real issue in clari@@ fication of sexual abuse was and is however that most victims from shame are silent .
&quot; if they were not even parents and bl@@ ings , then determined not to a chor@@ age , who would certainly have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ pupils R@@ atz@@ ing@@ ers role in terms of ab@@ norm@@ alities ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : a respon@@ dent student form@@ ulated it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I don &apos;t see any case in which he would have had been justified in the case ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) and could have had the respective perpet@@ rators .
&quot; I think it ... also for really absur@@ d to accept that out of him ... bub@@ bles in@@ urgent or clear@@ er or even more likely , than against their parents , dor@@ mit@@ es , confidence , etc . &quot;
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able .
&quot; thus , the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; that he applied to him in the preparation of affected students and / or their environment , could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; regarding sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore free to free from every competi@@ tor . &quot;
so it cannot be disc@@ ard@@ ed him not prevented or brought him to display .
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to connect its good name with these conflic@@ ting crimes , as unfortunately it happened in some cases . &quot;
in the media was much of &quot; non @-@ violence &quot; to read the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will be disc@@ ard@@ ed in the report . &quot;
does he have to live with this feed ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : this is the big issue that in the coverage of everything missed , and ended up to a huge mil@@ king of sexual abuse and non @-@ violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; however , this is in turn a mis@@ use of the report . &quot;
&quot; namely , there is clean separated : between the pre @-@ school and the gram@@ mar of Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and non @-@ violence , we say once , other things . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report covers inci@@ dents from the times since 1945 , so also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger does not have choir of dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the whole terrible test pre@@ y , the cases , in which h@@ ubs of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were controlled and mal@@ co@@ ed , were all@@ ur@@ ged themselves at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sk@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to have . &quot;
&quot; but with those that Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys first to face , when they were already on the cathedral . &quot;
&quot; on which was how the most witnesses emphas@@ ise the theme of &quot; &quot; Vor@@ schule &quot; &quot; tab@@ u . &quot;
&quot; one was just happy to be their escape , and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &apos; heav@@ enly . &quot;
what was different from the cathedral @-@ stop building ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : there is already discipline , but not a sa@@ di@@ stic violence . &quot;
&quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims expect the general humanity of R. , and therefore in many cases do even combine positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; thus , at the most likely still the sub@@ menu to have been dispos@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the Vor@@ schule . &quot;
&quot; the first time 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish itself and was responsible for the ex@@ its at a school , where he was just un@@ conscious and responsible , ( so the witness ) wanted nothing to hear , and then again around 1993 . &quot;
closed Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in front of the states consistently the ears ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the archipelago , which the report even re@@ produced . &quot;
&quot; in this he pointed out to this point , &quot; that in the Vor@@ schule continues to be practic@@ ed the test . &quot;
&quot; already in view of the danger of negative press releases , he received urgent interference . &quot;
&quot; this was of course at a time when legal clear@@ ness existed , as a test stra@@ ins also long been b@@ anned in Bavaria too . &quot;
&quot; before , she experienced it in a legal gray area , as each one of us still knows . &quot;
&quot; there was difficult to cher@@ ish for him , where those affected may be exag@@ ger@@ ated or dramatic and where really the per@@ missible border had been exc@@ eeded . &quot;
&quot; but you can also not say , he could have always looked away . &quot;
this is simply not true .
&quot; only in 1980 , the test of schools was officially completed in Bavaria too . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is asser@@ ted yes , unless today &apos;s educational standards for the time to apply . &quot;
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : we are talking about the &quot; &quot; Fall@@ stri@@ ck of the An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; , &quot; thus the danger , Past today &apos;s moral measures . &quot;
the princ@@ ess has been quite correct .
&quot; but this is of course not true for sexual abuse , who was ab@@ omin@@ able at all times and not for what was st@@ agn@@ ant in educational activities and violence against inno@@ cent children &apos;s ri@@ mp@@ s , which is already far beyond that time . &quot;
&quot; this is all very aw@@ ful , and I am glad that it is finally re@@ working . &quot;
&quot; but at the same time I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , for all that had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his funds for disciplines and punishment , so ear@@ rings and pull to the hair and ears were widespread in the 1970@@ s . &quot;
as physical balance then he has been forbidden .
&quot; which picture of his ra@@ iny time has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , as in the conversations with you for the book &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
did the topic test also come to the language ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , then Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI . , tells of his perspective , since the dom@@ sp@@ atzen played only a secondary role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I don &apos;t forget that he led there a stric@@ ter reg@@ im@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; but even this must be said to be said , without this perf@@ ection@@ ism , without the dis@@ claim un@@ conditional discipline , it would probably hardly be possible to form an institution of cosm@@ opol@@ y , true cultural bot@@ her@@ ence of Europe and his musical tradition , which went right twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) on tour . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone , one does not even make a huge singer and above every success , right in which area , however always discipline , passion and self @-@ cutting . &quot;
as what kind of people do you have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in discussions about their book ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : by working on the book and beyond I have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well acquain@@ ted and again as wonderful , hum@@ orous , livel@@ ih@@ ood and heart@@ y people , of which one could not imagine that he could also do something to do something . &quot;
&quot; I am regularly going on with , as many former dom@@ sp@@ atzen still today , 23 years after its embryo , regularly contact him to visit him - he is almost blind - and he will treat it as a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who are not for@@ given to it , that he was very strict at them , so are clearly in the minority . &quot;
most of the sp@@ atzen are grateful to him today that he enrich@@ ed her life and has given them the world of music .
&quot; and that he always has a good , v@@ esti@@ al teacher - a stric@@ ter father , certainly , that may be - but still a de@@ able respect , to which they still look up and to worship them . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again clearly : everything you thro@@ ws it , are obtaining methods that were at that time on the order of the day . &quot;
we can be glad that we have long ago overcome this time .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man , just because he is promin@@ ently and a still prominent brother has to go to the medi@@ al scap@@ ego@@ ats . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil int@@ ent , which is behind it , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which was just released , dism@@ is@@ sed him . &quot;
&quot; now the bonds areas would have acquired a 93 @-@ year old man who has acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps in Germany no one would know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace . &quot;
