<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the Federal State of Missouri, which should arise until 28 August 2017, visitors and abourianans, as a number of fragile, racial-based incidents in recent times occur and here merged," says it in the opinion of the group. "</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law of Missouri that makes it more difficult to gain discriminating discriminations, as well as the criminal enforcement authorities of the State, the disproportionate on minorities, illustrate the group, the travel warning, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">They have violations of citizens' rights to happen.</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are halted because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed," said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star. "</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear symptoms in such an incidence that we have not yet heard.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that which has issued the organisation for a state in the US.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the secrecy incidents like racist expo against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>

<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union had published by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) Destinations for Texas and Arizona, after the United States immigration authorities, who commit local criminal law enforcement authorities, which will contribute to further racuse rules, according to view of the ACLU to further racial profiling."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are usually issued by the Foreign Ministry for other countries, but at the last time, stakeholders have used to act as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Subsubproject is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a success project and continued next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU bundle Peter White and Kordula Kovac have created a picture on site.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the rectangenhof of the family Schwendemann met representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU locality together with Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs.</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann gave him insight into his farm, in which he has 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest beforet, 40 milk-rich and also houses many young animals and houses in five apartments holiday houses."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" "black-tmilk" "is for him the aging marketer path for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">"at the table of the Feriengo, only regionally."</seg>
<seg id="74">"as it is also BLHV-Chairman of fisbach, he describes the subsubproject as" elementary "." "</seg>
<seg id="75">I can not manage such a rigid areas not profitable.</seg>
<seg id="76">The founding area care for a lot of work, much mts with the engine sense are edited. "</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have to fight here with the conditions and with the topography," said Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the counter-operation and operated with these without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he does not lead the lead."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "the Commune has recognised the meaning of the ordination project, and is glad to promote the leader."</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the expense of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, the farmers would have to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">We hope that the forestation of the areas could be extended for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure that we have, are the people who work in agriculture and make their thoughts on how they continue to continue their operations," stressed the mayor. "</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often in criticism due to support</seg>
<seg id="84">More than 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">"for 40 hectares, the open area is 40 hectares, which may not be reforested by at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"the total cost of EUR 71 500 euros was funded by the total cost, a quarter carried out the municipality of fisherbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, the farmers had to invest 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16,2 kilometres."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," stated Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" "you make a really good job, without farmers and landlady it does not go."</seg>
<seg id="90">Also for Peter Weiss stand firm: "here are best food produced."</seg>
<seg id="91">The landscaping line (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state promotion of feminist fence.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is to ensure the growth of the black.</seg>
<seg id="93">Prerequisite is the presence of one of the LPR signed.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the enclosed surface must not be despermissible (Hanging over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by forestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the fisherman's ordination project, 2018 is currently running the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build nearly 16 kilometres of Zaun."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the common area is equivalent to 35 hectares, the calorie costs lie at more than 112 000 Euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">"the safest sign of a regime change, it is when they begin to attacking the statues."</seg>
<seg id="100">"Americans appreciate this as much as any other - therefore, the carving overthrow Saddam Hussone on the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003."</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key-ideologists of the Trump regime, knew certainly what he did, when he took a symbolic Axt in a hsled argument with Jim Acosta of CNN on the proposals of the president of the drastic limitation of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to stay fair, Miller took not the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">"a horde of bootspossessing and Liberty imitators should have suffered him, if he had done it."</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he laid their meaning, and especially the meaning that it was written, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, its base was added."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta, I want to go here not to a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom, which illuminated the world."</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem which you relate to which later was added later and not part of the original statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is always right, but as he formulated it himself, it is not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary resonance on the emerging words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the anger of the poor:" thy efills, your arms, and your frightered masses, which will swing clearer, free to breathe and eat the waste of your rich coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the 'elder waste' was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller committed himself to literary criticism - he clearly made that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict due to the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate: it is indeed a conflict for the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who set up their words according to their death on the base - did very well that they have a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by presented in an unused classical display of the female embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the feminine figure is no longer abstract, she has received one voice. "</seg>
<seg id="115">And she himself gives himself a completely different name: mother of the Exilants.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the contract with the image is a brilliant feminist Coup and a devastating attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just like Lazarus the meaning of the statue changed, the people wanted to switch from the right wing this for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the big Schreier than Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John of the Buyer for the Commen of Trump, argumented in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty had no one drawer, but rather an early Neooncology, the American Flame in the umented world:" Lady Liberty is proceeding. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It is supposed to carry the basel of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The basel is not supposed to shine the way into the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh here on something coated.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite and even a matter of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus consisted of Lazarus was to see how they were seen by the exhausted, but hopeful people after long and often terrible trips to the Decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"it is in the true sense to see the world from the perspective of people, to seek refuge and improve a chance of improving their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and will they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">"of course, this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to recognize."</seg>
<seg id="127">"your basel is not meant to enlighten the path, but the hate, who is their only source of power, inflamed."</seg>
<seg id="128">World championship 2017: Neil Black lobt Scottish members of the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle reminds of a time when only two villi belonged to the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">"the workmanship of the Athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-headed schottic controversy is a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record of Scottish Athleten was selected for London 2017 that starts on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">"black believes that" "in Scotland something special" "and the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand and we will continue, until we find it out," said Black. "</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish Athleten think that it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the guy on the roadside.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish Athleten are medals of medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team to the team of team."</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eiliie is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Your chapters speech was incredible. "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were shoty or wherever they live or train, went out of space and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the real feeling that emiliie came naturally, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth of Silver medallions, who will compete with the 400-m hurdles for the 400-m hurdles, says that it is" incredible "that 16 shields in the British crew."</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total at Athleten at the World Championship was seven who were 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle-range Muir results in this way and has positioned five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another shame, which one should be observed after a great season, which was made victory in the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle reminds himself of their first World Championships than the only other Schotte in the team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the creatic chapters says that they are" enormous proudly "to the fact that many of its governors do not only belong to the team, but in some cases, also in the medals and in the finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the speciality of this team member states that it was elected by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honour, but to know that my team mates voted for me and have chosen to something very special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the villi, who belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to rise on podium."</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech should be concerned as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">"I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, as we have a home world championship."</seg>
<seg id="158">"so it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from it, that we are back at the Olympiastadion."</seg>
<seg id="159">"I am coming a second chance to go there and compete, and it will simply be as a great atmosphere out there."</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking by critics about Facebook: Bewirb not for a public office if you cannot tolerate the entry of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The Father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it did not last long until the newspapers may smote him because of the interior policy as far as to its political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">He shredded with criticism, safe. "</seg>
<seg id="164">But he does not have brought his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"for in 1783, Washington:" "the freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute we will be guided as the sheep."</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to Governor Larry Hogan who must work on it, more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union defends it from the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the staging of the governor sent the lawsuit than frivol, and the online commentary was full of a counter-reaction with" Na, and?. "</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," said many people. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a guy like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican governor in a overwhelming democratic state that is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the two-ray consent of the 50 governor of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">"he was also very sent to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to turn his haired head to chemotherapy on his side."</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blockages of persons who come to the side of the governor - which is a public forum, which is officially designated as officially and by staff who are paid with public tax Dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hoard Specherin Amelia Chasse the acts of the Governor and argued that the blockages of comments is nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">"but it is too easy to use the image of TROLLEN or chambers, or hull-filled people who goes online the lash."</seg>
<seg id="181">"the post spoke with some of the real people, who were blocked by Hogan."</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, a entrepreneur and a pastor, not a role."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments respectful, thoughtful and not profiting."</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor cited the Bible in his post office and appellied to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani by Bowie, Md., was not hated, but she asked to hull."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented polite, that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate-breaking and other current news," she wrote in the commentary section of the messing "The Post."</seg>
<seg id="187">"I do not appreciate this idea if a number of people on the same topic takes position, then they will be disregarded by some rather than such a collective collective action, and not as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the employees of the Governors signed as" "concentrated spam attack, would other probably be" intercessors. ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocks a critic or a negative comment."</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is a lot of cleaners as in former times when you have done the same, that employees were kidnapped to collect newspapers with critical guidelines and to burn or burn demonstrators."</seg>
<seg id="191">But this is exactly what happened digital.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official that criticises Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is charged by Twitter-users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County the last the First Amendment, according to US-District, James C. Closis in Alexandria, when she called a voters from her Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky received Governor Matt Bein (R) also a visit from the ACLU because of its use by Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so hard.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time Washingtons had a similar effect as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous briefer swallow on his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even at that time Washington was anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people, the pseudonyms like" Juricola, "" Belisarius "," Belisarius "and" Portius "," wrote all letters of newspapers, Washington's decisions. "</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions which have criticised its position on the Treaty of Amity, the trade and the boat trip with Great Britain, the position, according to the historical documents, which were collected by the Online Papers of George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not have brought them to silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, disagreements and discourses belong to the basis of our nation."</seg>

<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's a proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed their pockets and sold.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex at Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I was looking for something, which was similar to my price."</seg>
<seg id="1322">This apartment was shown in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I loved her in her and made an offer on this day.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square-foot was completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a A-bedroom property with an wasted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne Stauraum and a mezzanine to make optimal use of the generous cover height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"this was my requirement," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="1328">"to this end, she was the Architect and Designstudio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to make the 12,5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the blanket was not big enough to place two rooms each other, so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">"Erfan had to think, to solve the task."</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," he explained. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so arrange that they were overthrown out, without having to gaps us."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not just about to build a simple platform, but the steel so that he had the right height at the top or down the correct height."</seg>
<seg id="1334">"this arrangement enabled Erfan, two spaces in full height - with much extra drama."</seg>

<seg id="1341">"due to the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Collapsible kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">What is special about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineer went in," explained Erfan of the steel reinforced, furnified MDF door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is too important, so that when you slide the door, very easily balancing."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to win additional 16 m ², an extra bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the basic space - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimental form will enter a real estate makler, and carry out a calculation based on the bottom size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to enlarge the floor surface and at the same time high quality materials used to generate its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are things that you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you do not love you into the electric plugs in walls.</seg>

<seg id="1414">How has it worked?</seg>

<seg id="1811">"but on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-level journalists discuss what is safer to feel safe: they should take their children with the office, who were the purpose of an attack with granates, or let them go home."</seg>

<seg id="1817">"there are no break-break from violence, and throughout the country the corpses, are more and more journalists doing so: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012 took his office in December 2012 and until now there were at least seven Tote in seven countries."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter, its publisher and its inspirator of Riodoce, the co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the greatest mistake is to be in Mexico and to be a journalist," "wrote Valdez in one of his many books on violence related to drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1820">"his absence will be deeply felt deep, although its presence is present everywhere - a large picture of Valdez, which shows its Middle finger in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing T-shirts, who will be his ridiculous face with glasses or its typical Panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although 2010 has established a probe-prosecution, in order to process the cases of journalists, this according to the Committee has led to the protection of journalists only two criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most thousands of murder, which are linked each year with drug trading and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely asked before judgment."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodoce, they still insist to treat the violence of Sinaloa, although they are intrapped and even though the terrain is now even betrayed."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information on the murderers, without justice, the meeting for the discussion of safety is little benefit, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to wasting my time in this workshop," says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we do not know the Why, misstrate us all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"in the morning of May, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he managed just to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota COROLLA was stopped by two men. he was drawn from his car and 12 times was shot by his car, probably due to the name of the newspaper - the" Twelve river "." "</seg>

<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adults children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Smells tend to fly to Culiacan free.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzmans remuneration last year and delivery in the United States in January was Sinaloa became one of the bloodiest of the country, as rivalised political groups fought here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot up on the road or that the cemetery is full of devoured, two-storey Mausoleen for drug royal, which are larger than many houses for the living."</seg>

<seg id="1838">"nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the blame that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first, there was in February the release of a interviews with Damaso Lopez, a leader of the rivaling cardboard boxes in the war with Guzmans Sal."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have doubled the sons, suspected gear-members bought each copy of the edition as soon as they delivered to time-kioske."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second mistake was to force Valdez not to force, after the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story, the country to its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad and his killing is considered as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues annahain that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced Reporter for Noroeste when he joined together with five colleagues for the establishment of Riodoce and 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to operate journalism without being on the noise-gift problem, "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"at the time the paper served a reputation because of the courageous and honest reporting, and the turnover and the advertising took place."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporter loving it, can publish hard apt investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else to cover."</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the formation of Riodoce she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot-Prize" for their reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage in the pursuit of Mexican drugs, wherever it has led."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave voluntarily to that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue on," he said at the time of the CPJ. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug stores in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You have to assume the task that falls you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"I don't want to be asked:" "what did you do given so many stilled... why did you not say what went before?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team missing Valdez, the Spaeth, who could fluctuate like a port worker, the friend, the generous with hugs and advice., a teacher, who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted on his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayama, the bar opposite from the office, and there are always sitting at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now ask them: was his love for routine his lowering?</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death also has forced them to ask their own assumptions about it, how they can do their work best and stay alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their native Start- and lanes, to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-sufficiency and self-control."</seg>
<seg id="1865">His own instinths trust.</seg>

<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>

<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant-eaters is the best preserved fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk, when he was born on 21 March 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something that appeared from the surrounding rock in the Platze, and decided to watch more precise."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil discovered that Fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaces.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1.100 kg) of heavy strains."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work the finished result is ready to be revealed, unveiled."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only have a little with the eyes of blinzeln you could almost believe it slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientists in the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature can be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will go into the sciences's history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs, the Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found that this plant fresser, though he is covered with a armament and resembles a changing tanks, probably from meat to send Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the strongly armored dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide in front of robbery, and used a shielding technology that is also used as a counterpart which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have allowed it to mix well into its surroundings and develop its enemies, say experts, which indicates that it was threatened by greater dinosaur."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of the Nodosaurs joined the first time in May and is now seen in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeo.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have studied the wild beast and it Borealopelta markchelli after the Museumstechnics Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7.000 hours so it was carefully ceilings."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen made it at Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists who document patterns and form of shoe and armaments across his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the constants, a widespread defensive method in the animal kingdom, which means the tip of the creature darker was considered their underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the contershaded is common, the results are surprisingly, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of today living animals."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it indicates that the dinosaurs have enough pressure through the meat and send Dinosaurs, that the evolution was favoured the confrontation as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals who use the tershades - think of deer, zebras or girth - are much smaller and hurt as loot, which signaled that this Nodosaurs was exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong roughness behaviour on a massive, strong armored dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs-Raubins have been to have been the cradle time," said Brown. "</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organised connections in their skals also shows that the skin of dinosaurs was red.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to investigate the animal in references to his life, including its contrasting Darminhaltes to find out what it has eaten as its last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaurs died when he died, into a river and into the sea, where he was on the back to the sea."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time, Alberta was as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans probably much more inland than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurs is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with consistent skin, but also in three dimensions remains intact and the original form of the animal retains," said Brown. "</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal is almost as it looks like in the early circle.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you do not need much imagination to use it. if you just have a little with the eyes shiels, you could almost believe that he is on sleep."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the circle was a time, as huge spa, carnivoress Dinosaurs, which stood on two legs, the earth crossed."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus rex, millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaurs was hunted by some of his terrible ancestors."</seg>

<seg id="1962">It contains two 20-inch-long peaks that raged by his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">"the researchers believe that the armored plant-fresser was welded by the Western Canada, until a flooded river it was flooded into the open sea."</seg>

<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this specific specimen are so well preserved that the skin resist still hollow tank-boards along the dinosaurs</seg>

<seg id="2019">How a activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">"just one day after having arrived in New York City, the church was born in St. Louis born on the bed of an Airbnb flat where they rented and scrolling through Facebook on their phone."</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled upon a post by someone from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police have just killed a 18-year child, and there is still on the road," it was there. "</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused as no one had posted on their feed the information, closed she Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly retweetet on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the Rapper from the territory of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18 year-year, who was killed by a white policemen in Ferguson, Mo., killed, live at home."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted an image of Browns vivid body that was stretched on the road and stay there four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that is wild, I thought ferrell."</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">"she placed her cell phone, to return later in the evening to Tweets over people at the Canfield drive."</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of the police band and people, the cried, and from a man who said, Browns Father, who contributed a sign with the wording:" Fergusons police have just killed my unarmed son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">"they observe a live feed, where a policeman was in front of a group of demonstrators with a rebellious dog."</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, deed another policy is his rifle and crib:" I will kill you... animals all kill. "</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not common," remembered Ferrell to their statement. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">That is not the kind of murder that we have accustomed to us and that we can name typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">In this moment I felt shame.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">They booked a retreat and went home on the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after the landing at 23 h, she took her 6 year old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two went to Ferguson the next morning."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the subject of a new documentary film," Whose Streets? "" in the cinemas from the 11. "</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a history of survival and Protestes, of love and loss, the strength and the contradictions which consists of the view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to ask answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as a ferrell with her daughter, which carried a flower dress and a suitable crown carried, after Ferguson, the two a conversation that they had countless times before this morning" over the black experience and the black state. "</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you only reminding you, as I have taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" remember what she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we go now to Ferguson, because the police have killed a 18-year-old boy and that was not right."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take them," said Ferrell later. "</seg>
<seg id="2046">What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It has to know and it must be educated and educated in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed, not only activism and organisation but also to know the different layers of black experience and the black constitution, and what we must do to free to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I have the luck to give her an experience, where they personally have no eklatant racism, it is not different than the next black women-child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I have the feeling, I would prove her a bad service to keep them away."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station when she arrived in Ferguson, located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which was founded to a campground than the activists on the possible non-indictment of Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there, Ferrell and her daughter joined together with a local business owner, the lunch made."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared pockets before and halves them to pass on demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism started to accept ferrell shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed completely changed after the 9th of August, she said and noticed that she was as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black municipalities."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It is all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later ferrell during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-director of the film. "</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said, she and her comrades Lucas Alvarado-Far.exe wanted to be" documented, "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came Ferrell into the meaning:" "want to document her, or tries to find a story that you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"these skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of wisdom - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance strength."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"like Folayan recently declared in an interview:" we had heard that people who have born in Ferguson and raised their voices, and we wanted to do it differently. "</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already worked together with the former Co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field, which is known for its activism around deadlines."</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment brought Ferrell the project closer together with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after browns.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we talk," said Davis "</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, as these people will be represented, because I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to focus on Ferrells experience - to show that in the movement it is not a Messiah leader, but to a community that comes together, said Folayan - she proved to be the apparent participant in the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"consequently show documents from" Whose Streets? "surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells lives, as she loves himself and her wife marries."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time. "</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability at this work and in the ailment of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrells history repeated history the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, which have shaped the film" BlacklivesMatter "in social media in 2012, identify themselves as pregnant."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement altogether," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women have to carry the main last of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan atmospheric, to notice that" the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women. "</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it is however that" this is not a pragmatic type of action, "at the Ferrell due to its identity as the heart of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person that ended up this energy," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no coincidence, although she was at the front line because in a life on these crosses than a black, gay woman is so much on the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"meanwhile, the news mates in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on nutrition for 2 ½ years because of the blockages of a highway with a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">"she describes the social policy atmosphere of the area that she calls her home:" "a chaos." ""</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless, she smiled out for a vocals and she feels obliged to this memory, since they left three years ago in Ferguson the road."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We have to love and support each other.</seg>

<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "Greater Wahn": TV-readers discuss about bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves the human being although they haven't been built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a mall at the Süver of the pedestrian zone has been developed since the first presentation of 2009 the population in supporters and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold leaves the subject hardly any one.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"also on our Facebook-Page" "Volksfreund Bitburg" "will be discussed the subject."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while the one of the bit Gallery say:" "this would be a dream" "(Anja Becker) or" "This would be real" "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other hand:" "does not need a man" (Siggi Brest) or quite simply: "" biggest "" (Lars Scholz). "</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the advocates are building that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, including the rest of the shops, the enemy, that then the pedestrian preceding."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"added: the gallery is planned exactly on the property, on which the peasant market stands in the 13 direct marketed its products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">With the beginning of the construction work will be the conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="2097">"the gallery Makers want to integrate a market hall in the new construction - namely to the Beda square, with possibility to go out for sitting outside."</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Rooms: "we have been for many years almost weekly in the peasant market hall."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the landlady always like to be very happy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Also the butcher we have discovered for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">There are also other cities in other cities.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether a director is marketed in a market hall in the gallery, comes to the amount of rent."</seg>
<seg id="2105">But it is likely to be very low in the new project. "</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "weighed shopping in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"clothing, shoes, clothing or supermarkets: I find this superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">"however, one sees how many stores are empty here - some have been here for months and years."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"however, there is not even a weekly calendar market, it is all the more important that we have left us at least the market hall."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered there is fresh, mostly directly from the producers and is available above."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"how to see, stores in a shopping center only collect from larger companies, as the dormitory tenets are often not portable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"too bad, special run there is almost no more and what still exists, will probably also disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a mall with a market hall is not fit together for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where is the peasant market during construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the old Edeka would be the solution - even on duration, if the bit gallery will actually come."</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or creates the Gespenst bit gallery already before, all the shops from Bitburg to expel? "</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "this will simply not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center, which is empty, does not need any one."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"but for a peasant market, it is thanks to the angry many - as I find - sensuous construction projects in Bitburg no place anymore."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the peasant market was broken, will disappear a piece of culture disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the room of the fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces - white, black and brown, which are almost instrange same - which hang out of the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Waves-Tupfar and Hacks that were sent by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent the excerpts from the prison of Fort Leavenworth, where the former intelligence service analysed was a 35-year prison-sentence, after she made a secret of diplomatic news about the website WikiLeaks publicly."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition that was opened on August 2, A Becoming resemblance (A suitable similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline was transformed into technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwife and motorised discretion, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithms analysis of DNA that could be extracted by Manning and created out of the 30 portraits of DNA that could be interpreted as a bit of intellectual comment - the many ways as they can be interpreted and the curing determinationism of these interpretations - but also to identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning that was born as Bradley Edward, but has been spoken openly since its puberty on the identification as a woman, including six violations of the Spionage utility, computer amounted and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"through the prison its image was suppressed, so much that it was only a single photo - a granularity, black-white Selfie, in the creasing is clearly sitting on a seat and a platinum status - which it was associated with it."</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came straight from the great success of its 2012-project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in this, the artist portraits of foreigners from forensic artefacts such as cigarette mute and chewing gum, in order to extract the DNA out of the waste to make a picture of how these people could look."</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a time-level agazin.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they led an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-Hagborg at a press release of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea, and asked them if they wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"the artist and her inexited muse have been unequal to unequal bricks, which are interchangeable over the course of two years."</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created one of Shoili Kanungo Illustrierte Comic" Suppressed Images, "which would foresee a future in which the President cheltenjudgment would change and it would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was released, Manning release after seven brutal years would demand in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happy-coincidence."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also now on the opening of the exhibition somewhat deeper and starkes as Donald Trump leads to war against informant from the government of government and against transgender troops, to find new, tweet ways to fix the rigid divisions that he actually should fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"as Dewey-Hagborg after the strange timing of all these things was asked, she said that" things are coming from a certain reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in one on the wall of Galerie written statement called Manning with her overgreat signature, including (" "i" "in their surname, is provided with a heart) an end of the" automatic fragmentation, whose foundation gender, breed, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall, its mitochondrial DNA-sequence - a thousand feet of Cs and GS and As, in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped, through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotide by the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist), how amazing, at least in biological terms, we all are."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully bring to that our genome is not taking care of who we are and how is open genetic data for a interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, their video-Werk of 2007, Spurious Memories. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition that is kept in a separate room is one side from the above mentioned Comic Novelle.</seg>
<seg id="2149">"it shows Manning, as it appears with a free-sprey in the hand from the disciplines of the United States as King-Kong."</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they put your speech, then they won" "says it."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so, never give the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter I wrote to me," "said the artist, who greet from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">I'm still going to be grips when I talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not seen the exhibition yet personally - as it was predictable in the Comiconic magazine - but if they should do it, then it will be welcomed in the center of the room from the masks, which coincide like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also focused on how everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5" 2, Manning Statur), where their genetic haplogs were written with pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted to feel like a crowd, said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits."</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted to feel like a mass movement, which formed with Chelsea, as the movement, which also got behind its release."</seg>

<seg id="2296">"it is not the first book of Rhodes, which is based on a archive: he wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpected emotional."</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestion like a nightmare.</seg>

<seg id="2582">"the incurable state that in the US roughly 1.3 million and in the UK 300.000 concerns, the stomach and bloods, recurring or bloody diarrings, weight loss and extreme fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while the affected is normally come to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers found researchers at the Washingtoner University, that the essential amino acid Tryptophan of proteins contributes to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leading researchers, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells at the intestine have patrol, to ensure that damaging microbes that hide themselves in the food, not penetrate into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells that are able to inflammations inflammations, are compensated of cells that protect the tolerance and protect the body without sensitive tissues."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the balance tend to be too far towards inflammation, it can result in a inflammable intestinal disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">"in experiments, it was established that a kind of tolerance stimulating immunisation in mice occurs, which carry out a certain bacterium in their initiates."</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium is needed Tryptophan - one of the builders of proteins - to view the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbioms and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an on tryptophan rich nutrition exceeded, less unoral intestinal limbs, if the same system is also accessible with people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the postdoctoral din Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan undersought a kind of immune cell, which had tolerance, as she found that a group of academic powers had such cells, but another group of this same tribe but was not accommodated."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"it suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal microbioma of mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and mushrooms, which usually live in the stomach-intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the intestinal of the mice were DNA-sequencing and there were six bacterial species found in the mice with the immune cells, but without them missing."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"mice were reared in a sterile environment so that they failed to have a intestinal microbiom and they did not have developed these kinds of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"to understand how the bacteria developed on the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri left in a liquid and overcarried small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells that were isolated from the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the toleranced cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"as the active component of the liquid was purified, it proved to be a by-product of the Tryptophan Metabolism that is known as the Indol-3-Milesc acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"when the researchers doubles the amount of tryptophan in the forage of mice double, the number of such cells rose by approximately 50 percent, but if the tryptophanro were halved, the number of cells rose by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">"Dr. Cervantes barragan declared that people have the same tolerating cells such as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri are protected in our stomach-intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether Tryptophan side-products from L. reuteri, the cells in humans develop as with mice, but Defects in genes in relation to Tryptophan were found in people with kidney disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said," "the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote, since these cells inflammations on the inner surface of the intestine."</seg>

<seg id="2887">"the police ask for now witnesses of the foresee, as well as the driver of the cursor, under Tel. 05761 / 92060 with the commissioner in Stolzenau."</seg>
<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen-report entlastet Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen-Report about the abnormalities dismissed Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is the author and historians Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen is continuing for discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"we are church" "We are church", "stated after publication compared to the Deutsche Press Agency, he anticipated by the former Regensburger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year brother of the Canadian Benedict XVI, an excuse."</seg>
<seg id="2893">"it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church, if Müller and ruatzinger would be deeply expressed by their own omissions or their at that time incorrect evaluation of the processes."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the Vatican" "Osservatore Romano", "on the other hand, criticized that in reporting about violence in the domspatzen with" two measure "." "</seg>
<seg id="2895">"with regard to the grips in Regensburg, no one that would have to be prevented" shameful and shameful acts "" that would be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "level medial manipulation", "so the author of medial Manipulation", "so the author of medietta Scaraffia, historians and member of the national Italian Bioethics committees."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit, the Catholic Church as a source of all evil, is already part of everyday life experience and prepares public opinion to keep normal for normal, writes Scaraffia."</seg>
<seg id="2897">Also the stin Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in an interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk: 'you would like to go on the church and this is a consolidated catch.</seg>
<seg id="2898">"moreover, she pointed out that in their youth" "beats have been a very normal pedagogical means" to be with friends, as I was one. "</seg>
<seg id="2899">"it is unfair, to apply today's standards to earlier decades because the world have changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with reports of the abuse of abnormalities often also pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"completely wrong, author and historians Michael Hesemann, who was translated with Ratzinger the reminder" My brother of Pope "(in 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Hesemann, "for all that had nothing to do with him," he adds the results of the thesis. "</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly stands in the 440-page report that has presented by the diocum Regensburg with clarification of Ulrich Weber</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and early 1990s, with high resolution, 67 Domspatzen sexually abused."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report, it is called to Georg Ratzinger, who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg:" in summary, so that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases shapes physically and psychological violence have been applied. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially with high emotional onality, the punishment of the students could also be vehemous."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, in contrast to numerous other defects that many victims are estimating the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even combine positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in an interview, Hesemann, why the Final Report about the misuse of the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger of his opinion is discharged."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr Hesemann, the 440-Pages report on the" "incidents of violence" "of the Regensburger Domspatzen" "is a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"for one stand many students his" "humanity". ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"for the other, he also appears as a choleriker and perfectionist that has been tangible, when a domain name musically led no top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate as his biographer to this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you read the trouble and reads all over the 440 pages long from the front up to the back, one has to ask for the name of Georg Ratzinger at all in it."</seg>
<seg id="2914">"they are just eight sides dedicated to it, and he will be clearly spoken by any suspicion of the mediators or fellow-workers in the terrible cases sexual abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2915">"also, the violence against the school is also based outside of its active sphere."</seg>
<seg id="2916">"you can throw him any place, too late, or not have taken the first assumptions not seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the domspells-design, on which he was acting, was perceived by virtually all respondents than - so literally -" salvation "," "Heaven" and "better world." "</seg>
<seg id="2918">"thus the vast majority of his pupils Georg Ratzinger also describes it as" warm-hearted, "" sincerely, "" sincerely, "" sincerely, "" knowledgeable, "" knowledgeable, "" knowledgeable, biscuits and Bonbons were buried and "always by grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority worth about his perfectionism and its high emotional onality that also led to Wutausages.</seg>
<seg id="2920">"that he did not only bowed with chairs and bowed on the ground, but also the keys and too well-shared guys to the hair or ears, he himself depled up years ago, deeply regret and excused for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"however, to his honor, however, must be said that such surveys in the fragment period, the 1960s and 1970s have been widely used, in parents like with teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think of each of us who was born in 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also have seen this in a world-world school, a state-Gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what it actually goes to this report, namely the dependable sexual abuse and non-violence at the school, are the liberally bagatelles."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"you ask yourself whether it is not rather with his reputation, and his role as brother of Benedict XVI. to do, that many media has just crossed him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"on the Bavarian Pope, many who have never understood him, still more icy."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report entlastet Georg Ratzinger in every sense!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the media, in connection with the report was reported much about the subject of misuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger will also be put into a load by Georg Ratzinger in the Final Report as well as any contracting or fellow-understanding in terms of sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual victors claims to have become familiar to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I never forget to talk to my father or mother, said a sufferer deputy for the others," It was all very embarrassing. "</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real issue in clarification of sexual abuse was and is however that most victims from shame are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they were not even parents and blings, then determined not to a chorage, who would certainly have been a colleague of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen-pupils Ratzingers role in terms of abnormalities?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a respondent student formulated it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I don't see any case in which he would have had been justified in the case (Georg Ratzinger) and could have had the respective perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I think it... also for really absurd to accept that out of him... bubbles inurgent or clearer or even more likely, than against their parents, dormites, confidence, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable.</seg>
<seg id="2941">"thus, the report comes to the very clear result:" that he applied to him in the preparation of affected students and / or their environment, could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="2942">"regarding sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is therefore free to free from every competitor."</seg>
<seg id="2943">So it cannot be discarded him not prevented or brought him to display.</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to connect its good name with these conflicting crimes, as unfortunately it happened in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media was much of "non-violence" to read the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger will be discarded in the report. "</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this feed?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: this is the big issue that in the coverage of everything missed, and ended up to a huge milking of sexual abuse and non-violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"however, this is in turn a misuse of the report."</seg>
<seg id="2950">"namely, there is clean separated: between the pre-school and the grammar of Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and non-violence, we say once, other things."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report covers incidents from the times since 1945, so also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger does not have choir of domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole terrible test prey, the cases, in which hubs of sadistic teachers were controlled and malcoed, were allurged themselves at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really skandalous conditions have to have."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with those that Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys first to face, when they were already on the cathedral."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on which was how the most witnesses emphasise the theme of" "Vorschule" "tabu."</seg>
<seg id="2955">"one was just happy to be their escape, and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even 'heavenly."</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the cathedral-stop building?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there is already discipline, but not a sadistic violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2958">"and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that" many victims expect the general humanity of R., and therefore in many cases do even combine positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"thus, at the most likely still the submenu to have been disposed."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"but despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the Vorschule."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time 1970 / 71, when he began to establish itself and was responsible for the exits at a school, where he was just unconscious and responsible, (so the witness) wanted nothing to hear, and then again around 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Closed Georg Ratzinger in front of the states consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the archipelago, which the report even reproduced."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this he pointed out to this point," that in the Vorschule continues to be practiced the test. "</seg>
<seg id="2965">"already in view of the danger of negative press releases, he received urgent interference."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"this was of course at a time when legal clearness existed, as a test strains also long been banned in Bavaria too."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before, she experienced it in a legal gray area, as each one of us still knows."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"there was difficult to cherish for him, where those affected may be exaggerated or dramatic and where really the permissible border had been exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"but you can also not say, he could have always looked away."</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the test of schools was officially completed in Bavaria too."</seg>
<seg id="2972">"Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis asserted yes, unless today's educational standards for the time to apply."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we are talking about the" "Fallstrick of the Anachronism", "thus the danger, Past today's moral measures."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has been quite correct.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but this is of course not true for sexual abuse, who was abominable at all times and not for what was stagnant in educational activities and violence against innocent children's rimps, which is already far beyond that time."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"this is all very awful, and I am glad that it is finally reworking."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection, for all that had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his funds for disciplines and punishment, so earrings and pull to the hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">As physical balance then he has been forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"which picture of his rainy time has Georg Ratzinger, as in the conversations with you for the book" My brother of Pope ""? "</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the topic test also come to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, then Pope Benedict XVI., tells of his perspective, since the domspatzen played only a secondary role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I don't forget that he led there a stricter regiment."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but even this must be said to be said, without this perfectionism, without the disclaim unconditional discipline, it would probably hardly be possible to form an institution of cosmopoly, true cultural botherence of Europe and his musical tradition, which went right twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991) on tour."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and Bonbons alone, one does not even make a huge singer and above every success, right in which area, however always discipline, passion and self-cutting."</seg>
<seg id="2987">As what kind of people do you have experienced Georg Ratzinger in discussions about their book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: by working on the book and beyond I have experienced Georg Ratzinger really well acquainted and again as wonderful, humorous, livelihood and hearty people, of which one could not imagine that he could also do something to do something."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I am regularly going on with, as many former domspatzen still today, 23 years after its embryo, regularly contact him to visit him - he is almost blind - and he will treat it as a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who are not forgiven to it, that he was very strict at them, so are clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the spatzen are grateful to him today that he enriched her life and has given them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he always has a good, vestial teacher - a stricter father, certainly, that may be - but still a deable respect, to which they still look up and to worship them."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again clearly: everything you throws it, are obtaining methods that were at that time on the order of the day."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long ago overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust, a man, just because he is prominently and a still prominent brother has to go to the medial scapegoats."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intent, which is behind it, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which was just released, dismissed him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the bonds areas would have acquired a 93-year old man who has acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps in Germany no one would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace."</seg>
