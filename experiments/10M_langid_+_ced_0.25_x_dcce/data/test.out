Jenni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I always put out in dra@@ wers
Jenni@@ fer Ani@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
this was clearly done by Hollywood star in an interview with un@@ ambig@@ uous .
&quot; I will always put up in dra@@ wers , or come from the outside label , who often have little to do with me and the reality . &quot;
&quot; I myself do not have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly speaking , these things are rather s@@ add@@ led . &quot;
Jenni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only lau@@ gh it as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as it explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opol@@ itan . &quot;
&quot; most importantly , the act@@ ress can spend their time at home , pre TV with loose Dut@@ t and Mexican food , is it in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; for the white gl@@ ade , they have the question of the children &apos;s wish : &quot; we women must not be married or have children to be completely &quot; , &quot; so the Hollywood star . &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is no children &apos;s game &quot; is Ani@@ ston as an all@@ an mother of two sons .
the film runs with us from 25 August .
Gol@@ fer L@@ anger gets the sport @-@ pyram@@ ids
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf ni@@ ers in South Africa attracted Bernhard L@@ anger with some colleagues a bit of variety with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a first .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden Sport@@ pyram@@ ids &quot; for Bernhard L@@ anger
&quot; after a couple of minutes remin@@ ded the horses at their holiday , she died at the fast Gal@@ op@@ p home to the feed ones . &quot;
&quot; a few kilometers at this pace , I have been afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; &quot; says L@@ anger . &quot;
and thus the equ@@ estrian shows then also ended .
on Saturday Germany was the best gol@@ fers of all time - 101 tournament goat - back near horses .
he allowed himself to lead himself to a horse with his family over the complex of the AL@@ RV on a horse .
this was the first time in Aachen and with the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convin@@ cing .
the German athle@@ tics to the man from An@@ hausen in the frame of a small Gal@@ a the Gol@@ den@@ e Sport@@ pyram@@ ids .
there is not a lack of awards at the li@@ ke@@ able sports@@ men .
&quot; federal states , Silber@@ nes Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has already seen him already .
&quot; long , the 18th laur@@ e@@ ates the Sport@@ pyram@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; in Aachen , he met the first prize of Hans Günter Win@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; this award means me much , &quot; &quot; says L@@ anger , &quot; for it will not only be for sporting achievements but also for social engagement . &quot;
for decades L@@ anger has been promoting the offspring .
&quot; and so , he also gave the price of 25@@ ,000 Euro equal . &quot;
&quot; with 15 more outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ fold American Master &apos;s winner was taken on Saturday to the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of the German Sports . &quot; &quot;
&quot; among the excellent include the lighter , Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Sch@@ mitt , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ fted , the Ru@@ er Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ru@@ ki Peter Wi@@ en@@ eke , the fountain Al@@ win Sch@@ ock@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of hand@@ hard Er@@ hard . &quot;
many of these sports leg@@ ends were on Saturday to Aachen .
after the official part the illustr@@ ate society went to the Spring@@ stadi@@ on where the Lav@@ az@@ za prize ran .
Bernhard L@@ anger has a distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tru@@ mp@@ s Economic Policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and preventing the trade agreement - they want both Clinton and Tru@@ mp .
&quot; however , the two US pres@@ idency have however been present in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental matter . &quot;
&quot; the differences in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a basic , rather philosoph@@ ical difference . &quot;
the report on the role of the state .
Tru@@ mp wants to keep the doubt rather small in doubt and war@@ ned how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton wants to pun@@ ish the economy to death and regul@@ ate the economy he says .
&quot; in contrast , he would be quite different , claims Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; he will return to the regulations , and he makes for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax @-@ sets strong - for individuals and for companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton says : the state has given certain tasks to meet , he has dis@@ advantaged opportunities and need money . &quot;
&quot; therefore , taxes would increase for the rich , says it . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in the nuts , Tru@@ mp and Clinton are almost protected . &quot;
the democratic applic@@ ants pre@@ domin@@ ates the greatest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
&quot; state investment programmes into the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are rejected by the state @-@ critical team@@ work of the Republi@@ can . &quot;
&quot; thus , the Tru@@ mp could also come to cross @-@ party discussions . &quot;
more evident are the differences in energy and climate policies .
Tru@@ mp wants to build coal @-@ power plants and re@@ covering the coal production in the United States .
&quot; oil promotion is also intended to be possible to termin@@ ate in so far protected areas , the Paris climate agreement wants to termin@@ ate it . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , Clinton wants to expand its investment programme specifically with their investment programme : &quot; &quot; a country will create the super power of clean energies and create millions jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want that we are . &quot;
&quot; but not only in infrastructure - even with international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from one another . &quot;
TP@@ P , the tran@@ sp@@ azi@@ ical trade agreement , do not want to sign up . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both the US does not want to isol@@ ate the U.S. from international trade - but simply to protect American jobs . &quot;
&quot; these should then be paid better , for example Clinton . &quot;
the present minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a fam@@ ousness .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tru@@ mp wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must r@@ end , then he says he should not be altered . &quot;
but the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop tax policy on both camps .
&quot; on the one hand , Tru@@ mp , who wants to dis@@ close the economy and the citizens to boost growth . &quot;
his critics are holding him so that the household defic@@ it would only be greater .
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton is to ask at least from the rich people that they pay more taxes and their critics are saying , more taxes are also not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; every runner has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence is one of women who fle@@ e alone , almost already to everyday life . &quot;
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed . &quot;
a house offers refu@@ ge .
in a large kitchen there are four women sitting .
each has a baby at the most one year old .
one has put her little son in the arms .
he gu@@ ck@@ ed with big eyes curious in the room .
his mother che@@ ered to the table @-@ plate .
until they take note that it is observed .
it smil@@ es short and kis@@ sing the cl@@ one .
the scene works normal .
until you speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; it is the organiz@@ er of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social assistance in Bavaria , and deals with the topic of women on the flight . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are refugees .
they live in the Mün@@ ch@@ ner north in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alized accommodations for all@@ eged women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs made the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Mün@@ ch@@ ner Women &apos;s aid .
&quot; unfortunately , it was officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not exist - even as visitors .
the exception is a wax in front of the door .
&quot; it is not exag@@ ger@@ ated to say : every woman who arri@@ ves here , has made their flight experiences with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
men &apos;s going to wars because they are politically prosec@@ uted because they dro@@ w@@ ned torture or death because their families may send them as hop@@ e@@ pers to Europe .
&quot; in women , other reasons for the flight : &quot; many ste@@ aling themselves secre@@ tly , because they do not see any other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their home they have experience with sexual violence , forced , honor@@ ary , honor@@ ary , sla@@ very or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
this is what drives them away .
the flight continues .
&quot; that tu@@ gs call for example for a bottle of water a sexual act is not rar@@ ity , &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr &quot;
&quot; and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; who believe that the end , as soon as they came in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; also here , all women in refu@@ gee camps were often considered as a min@@ ent and worst . &quot;
&quot; this leads to that about 90 percent of women living in the north of the Mün@@ ch@@ ner north , they are under@@ estimated . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not optional . &quot;
many women are so used to say that they say nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t trust , openly about the experience , because the shame is too great . &quot;
&quot; since they often don &apos;t afford to help , there are more accommodations just for them , calls . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees . &quot;
&quot; on the question whether they we@@ ave from a similar project like in Munich in its jurisdiction , answer some of them . &quot;
&quot; in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , about there is something in accommodations of governments not . &quot;
&quot; also in Schw@@ aben are not separated only refugees , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , Press meeting of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Lower and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken there are some shared floors or separate houses just for all women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
the committee &apos;s rights and gender equality in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommod@@ ated by men .
&quot; in a study that has been published for the Committee , it is : &quot; it is very important that men and women are being separate . &quot;
&quot; if the privacy or become involved , men and women are accommod@@ ated together , it can become an ongoing - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; above all , the wash@@ rooms should be easily accessible and easily accessible to women , stands in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much the women feel that needs of this protection , one can take place at the And@@ verti@@ sing that it is available to the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since it has been around for around , we have a long queue , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
you could easily make a second house .
assist@@ ants : demands for new working @-@ work measures
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dep@@ uty the assistant of assist@@ ants have called their trade union to claim new labour @-@ magne@@ tism in their dispute regarding a new contract . &quot;
&quot; the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has requested its entire Council , from the beginning of September more labour @-@ magne@@ tism . &quot;
&quot; the J@@ DC said that the ministers would have said , to address the concerns of the contract . &quot;
&quot; assistant and medi@@ t@@ inst@@ ations have agreed in July on the rejection of a contract , which was agreed with the BM@@ A . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of its members which voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to members who was published on Thursday on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC cub@@ its Mc@@ Court said that the government was &quot; per@@ sever@@ ely quiet &quot; to problems , what was rejected that the contract was rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; given the J@@ DC Management Board , the proposed new contract completely reject the proposed new contract and requested its official re@@ bo@@ oting too all that &apos;s concerns . &quot;
&quot; as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board has put an formal application to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to start a permanent programme of the BM@@ A Council , which begins in early September . &quot;
&quot; the dispute was led to the assistant of this year sixth , the first tot@@ als in the history of the NH@@ S . &quot;
&quot; the director of the BM@@ A assistant , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana entered after the election to reject the agreed terms agreed by the BM@@ A . &quot;
&quot; he shared BM@@ A members during meetings , who still found before the vote through 54.@@ 000 assist@@ ants and medi@@ t@@ inst@@ ations , with that the contract should be beneficial and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Health Minister Jer@@ emy H@@ unt said that the contract for doctors in England would be introduced . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of out@@ sider &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
the leader of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves the hands and announce an official end of the eight months to pro@@ claim war and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter@@ part in the for@@ ol@@ ated Hall of St. Pet@@ ers@@ burger Pal@@ ast@@ es in reception , I cannot w@@ ept away the expression that Ankara that wants to take this reconciliation in most . &quot;
&quot; there was the ble@@ ach , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s gr@@ ass@@ ed gr@@ ated and he barely scrat@@ ched heating , even for its durability . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an , on the other hand , said to be repeated by his &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; - according to a report all five times . &quot;
I could not count it anymore .
&quot; he also said that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but even better . &quot;
the next day described a newspaper that Erd@@ og@@ an could have heard as if never had anything wrong .
me seemed to be the opposite of me rather than the opposite .
&quot; but one of Putin pat@@ chy , sustainable bold@@ ness showed that the state of Russia had nothing forgotten . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing that he mentioned in his introduc@@ tions : the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Mos@@ k@@ aus reaction at the time was angry .
Putin shared and acc@@ used Ankara to put Russia into his back .
&quot; the verse was even bigger , since it was committed by a dream@@ y friend . &quot;
&quot; the V@@ etr@@ is re@@ build up again becomes difficult , if not even impossible . &quot;
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months long , the state @-@ controlled media led a fier@@ ce , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
at once it seemed as if the Tur@@ ks would pay for anything to blame .
&quot; in the case of serious officials , the acc@@ us@@ ations of the officials , that Erd@@ og@@ an &apos;s own family were benef@@ ited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria , which should be controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he has advanced this veh@@ ement .
&quot; but in St.@@ Petersburg , the official message showed that it was time to look ahead . &quot;
&quot; finally , this meeting place only place because Putin received from the President Erd@@ og@@ an the exc@@ use he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia was able to cancel a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the benefits of a cease @-@ fire are clear on the hand . &quot;
Erd@@ og@@ an is in the first place all friends who can get it after the last month with a failed coup d almost at the top .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey also have sh@@ aken him .
but there are also economic moti@@ ves .
&quot; Russian sanctions have met Turkey - especially the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast . &quot;
the number is gone around almost 90 % .
travel agencies and charter companies will be facilit@@ ated when the flights are recorded again .
they are count on a late @-@ ais@@ le margin to the Mediterranean Sea .
&quot; this week projected the high level of cheap fruits and vegetables , as soon as the Turkish agr@@ arian import@@ ed again will be allowed to be allowed . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti form@@ ulated it as follows : &quot; tourists there long , tom@@ atoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry on the West because it &apos;s reaction to the tried and tried power of power than weak response .
&quot; in addition , the continuing Gro@@ ll on the Schn@@ eck@@ ent@@ emp@@ o of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the er@@ pi@@ ke is to pull out of the cool mood and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot;
&quot; in Ankara with certainty , the Russian state of Govern@@ or won a bonus in Ankara that he called for the state @-@ rich support for the elected government organs . &quot;
&quot; for Moscow , it is a matter of course for Moscow , which has a profound fear of reg@@ im@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; the summit meeting in this gl@@ oss palace was made by Russia and Turkey , one , as it was a analy@@ st once described , &quot; Alliance of reci@@ pro@@ pag@@ ation , &quot; &quot; Alliance of reci@@ pro@@ cal &quot; &quot; : two countries that betra@@ y away from the West and have been poor@@ ly treated . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two still big differences . &quot;
&quot; the greatest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently been the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support these pages . &quot;
&quot; it could be significant that after nearly three hours of first meeting both president on the press conference , they said that they would not have striped the issue . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey v@@ ast@@ ed it to respond to a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emph@@ asi@@ ze this . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common den@@ omin@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; however , after months of open hos@@ tili@@ ties - and given the potential for a perfect disp@@ atch , when NATO member has decl@@ ined the Russian Kamp@@ fj@@ et , it is certainly better that the two heads of state at least another talk . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland &apos;s no longer available
&quot; according to the G@@ BS brand , the brand R@@ BS is said to be reduced to a Back@@ office . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
R@@ oss Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland that the brand R@@ BS was connected to the global ambi@@ tions of the bank .
the Bank has since been dis@@ soci@@ ated since she was saved almost eight years ago and had to be saved .
&quot; in this period , brand strategies &quot; R@@ BS &quot; is used to protect other end @-@ consumer brands .
they supported international sports with millions pounds of Sponsor@@ ing from Six Nations Rugby to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Murray .
&quot; but now , she has decided to push more national brands into the focus . &quot;
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland , but will not initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales all RS@@ B References , the central headquarters and the stock exchange at Nat@@ West can change . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other , smaller brands for the private customer business , which will receive more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand will be employed to our Invest@@ ors brand as well as the brand , among which our employees will be busy as we are now going to become a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; when the Bank has become a global brand , R@@ BS became the global brand . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say now that we do not pursue global targets , but local goals . &quot;
each of these marks will be completely different in their own communities for something completely different and our employees are working with customers among those brands .
R@@ BS has already said that there will be the Six Nations Sponsor@@ ing will no longer be continued and that it will increase the per@@ cep@@ ability of various brands in his sport sponsorship .
&quot; it is time for us to develop to the bank of brands , for how do we focus inside ( we have asked ) to make this to a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cally ago three years ago , if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and that marks . &quot;
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , think I will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these brands again , so I think that time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reached on Pre@@ dil@@ ection its 3.@@ 000@@ th prize at New@@ market
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori testing champ@@ agne after a double in New@@ market , which brings him 3.@@ 000@@ th prize . &quot;
the J@@ ock@@ ey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori continued on Friday its 3.@@ 000@@ th British profit in New@@ market .
&quot; he sat down on Pre@@ dil@@ ection , which is trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local circuit , with his second win of the night a milestone . &quot;
the 45 @-@ year Itali@@ ans is the sixth J@@ ock@@ ey which reaches the milestone in the flat race .
&quot; he follows Sir Gord@@ on Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Willi@@ e Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won on G@@ hay@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; it is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is also here
&quot; I am very happy about that it is done with New@@ market , because I walked here 30 years ago . &quot;
&quot; it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it is a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very mod@@ est .
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori takes the rejo@@ icing , when he put the victory on pre@@ dil@@ ection . &quot;
&quot; two J@@ ock@@ eys have reached the milestone in the obstacles race - J@@ ock@@ ey Richard Johnson and the reti@@ red 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached more than 4,@@ 300 vic@@ tories in a record @-@ breaking career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the ninth Der@@ by@@ winner had 4,@@ 493 Manag@@ er@@ esi@@ ology &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best J@@ ock@@ ey of Modern and there is no surprise that he has reached this milestone which reaches only a few in front of him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical int@@ ell@@ ect that diff@@ ers him from the others in the weight control . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic amb@@ assador for races , his enthusiasm and char@@ isma trained fans for years for this sport . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already been fet@@ ched of 6@@ ,000 profits if he would not only be a weekend and big tur@@ nier@@ jo@@ ck@@ ey ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has already more than 30 years of winners in the UK which is great .
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a bri@@ tish race but in addition he is an incredible J@@ ock@@ ey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celeb@@ rates the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; by flying finishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flag@@ ship of the British Flach@@ r@@ enn@@ ings for two decades . &quot;

&quot; a whole series of gener@@ osity win , including its famous &quot; gl@@ or@@ rich Si@@ eben &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survi@@ ved a plane crash and received a drug ban . &quot;
&quot; three years ago he had initially returned first , when he returned from his six@@ sm@@ on@@ ati@@ te lock , but he showed an impressive strength to def@@ ect its branches and to return to his order . &quot;
and he is still not at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori has once said that he wants to continue with competitions until his least 50.@@ net living year .
Russia Putin hum@@ id Stab@@ sch@@ ef Serge@@ i I@@ van@@ ov
the Russian President Vladimir Putin has released his Stab@@ sch@@ ef Serge@@ i I@@ van@@ ov .
I@@ van@@ ov was many years part of the eng@@ th@@ est Trust of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed for the special officer for environmental and transport issues .
&quot; in an opinion of Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is that Putin without st@@ ating reasons &quot; dism@@ is@@ sal I@@ van@@ ov@@ s have been arranged by his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o who was Dep@@ uty since 2012 I@@ van@@ ov@@ s Dep@@ uty was appointed to his successor .
&quot; ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 1972 was born in the Est@@ onian capital city of Tall@@ inn , he made his conclusion at the prestigious State Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the emb@@ assy of Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; on the Kre@@ m@@ lin website ( Russian ) , it means that he was later the Chief of the Chief of the Government of the Government . &quot;
&quot; he said about his appointment he said to Putin , thank you for your trust . &quot;
&quot; I think it is the most important task of the government , to support your activity as a state of state and checks for the implementation of your instructions . &quot;
Putin shared the Russian TV broad@@ band on Friday with that I@@ van@@ ov is asked to leave his job and advised V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convin@@ cing the ridi@@ cul@@ ous faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ i I@@ van@@ ov was a long time one of the closest trusted Vladimir Putin and works as he for the Soviet intelligence , the K@@ GB . &quot;
&quot; as a rod , he was one of the most powerful men of the country . &quot;
&quot; in a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , asser@@ ted both men that the Stab@@ sch@@ ef occurs at his own wish . &quot;
&quot; but despite the smil@@ es for cameras , here are only a few of them convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so here is the consequence of a kind of power struggles ?
this is currently no one .
&quot; but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who was once established as a potential president , once the Russian environmental policy wants to lead to great skep@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in his comments on Putin , who are c@@ ited on the Kre@@ m@@ lin website , said I@@ van@@ ov , &quot; it is true that I have asked you in early 2012 in a talk to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - descri@@ bing posts four years long . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian pres@@ dial@@ o for four years and eight months . &quot;

Queens@@ ferry Cross@@ ing : bridge now with Fi@@ fe connected
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017 . &quot;
engineers have linked the North @-@ deck of the classical ferry cross@@ ings with the via@@ duct - which means that the bridge is now connected with Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four transi@@ tions of &quot; cover &quot; , &quot; which approach each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
the lo@@ wering section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tons .
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 Sch@@ rä@@ g@@ sei@@ le . &quot;
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion expensive project may be completed by May 2017 . &quot;
&quot; audi@@ tor , Kei@@ th Brown , the construction site today took a visit and was one of the first who went from the land to the bridge . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; This is a historical and symbo@@ lic moment in the construction of the ferry @-@ ferry cross@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; we are all witnesses of an engineer with a truly ep@@ ic measure in this project with more than 30.000 ton concrete and steel , which were used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the via@@ duct and the Br@@ ück@@ ende@@ ck &apos;s activity , which require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , almost 79 % of the entire Br@@ ück@@ ende@@ cks are on their place and the last section of Dec@@ ks get a concrete bed for the Deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , Project manager of For@@ th Cross@@ ing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first cl@@ amp presents a significant milestone in each brid@@ ging project . &quot;
with this fantastic project the closure trend@@ setting up and low @-@ scale .
&quot; after installing the last road covered , and the connection with the north @-@ deck area , we had to conclude that even existing gap on the north or country side . &quot;
this was reached by Zi@@ ehen of the northern Z@@ ub@@ ring@@ bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very hot activity .
&quot; massi@@ f since the via@@ duct is 222 metres long , weighs approximately 6@@ ,000 tons and had to be drawn up at a slope of approx . 3 % . &quot;
&quot; hot , as the toler@@ ances that the team works , tiny were only a few milli@@ meters . &quot;
fortunately everything went very well .

who builds on &apos;s cheap apartments ?
the SPD and Green my : investors should be taken much stronger in the future for future .
how do you react to the bad news that you will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years ?
&quot; the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; &quot; concept of living &quot; . &quot; &quot;
but arguments is program@@ med .
first and foremost it is about the question : who is supposed to build the affordable housing ?
a regulation has been missing until now .
&quot; SPD member Group Christoph Brat@@ mann means : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas in future , 20 percent of all the apartments have to offer as social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the cheap apartments can also be found in the stock . &quot;
&quot; the great dispute settlement in the city hall is however , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; how to build investors who want to build on private areas ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to rely on such areas at least 10 percent , but as 20 percent of the apartments are building as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new urban construction of housing programme , which will cost millions of costs and will need to be financed by inc@@ ense . &quot;
&quot; the problem , so viol@@ mann : &quot; there are currently no agreement between the groups . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as a few rules as possible .
the left is still cur@@ ed for investors .
&quot; regardless of his , so viol@@ mann , a tight@@ ening of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; will be implemented in action , this will provide additional tasks in the management administration . &quot;
more staff is required .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the professionals .
&quot; yet the program is not entirely clear : for the approximately 1260 new apartments , which should be built already in any case . &quot;
&quot; but how do you get the loss of further about 1300 cheap apartments , whose promotion is going out in the coming years ? &quot;
&quot; only by 2020 , there will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent this , so the plan@@ e@@ oli@@ tic speech in Nicole Palm , should now be purchased for current ties from the city . &quot;
&quot; moreover , it would have to be expected to get apartments back into the price . &quot;
this is possible in the West City .
to one stroke will solve the problem .
&quot; for in the west @-@ city , there is a yearly dead@@ lines . &quot;
&quot; around 1800 apartments , one could get back to the price for cheap apartments . &quot;
&quot; only : this is the owner , the housing corporations . &quot;
&quot; because the number of social housing in the West town is again dramatically increasing , one is removed from the goal of so @-@ called through interference . &quot;
there will no longer be a concentration of social weak in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens will count that there will be even movement in the discussion .
&quot; Executive Vice @-@ president Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke means : &quot; for a wide majority , the CD@@ U must be with the boat . &quot;
&quot; indeed , they have concentrated on more construction sites for family dwell@@ ings . &quot;
but what does not mean that yet another compromise can be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go to hunt for health and happiness which is worthwhile
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
&quot; that teen@@ agers and child to play no longer go outside , but rather to spend their leisure time , on scre@@ ens , was charged on monitors , was charged on the last decade of many . &quot;
po@@ k@@ em@@ on Go it is about to get people from the sofa and become more active .
&quot; the time on the screen was initially limited to TV , then on video games and last to smart@@ phones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mut@@ ually exclusive . &quot;
&quot; I am of course looking forward to the Pok@@ é@@ mon go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that were built on the characters in the 1990s ( later it came into a cartoon series , games maps and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; how many phenomena of pop @-@ culture s@@ ank the interest in front of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand in early July . &quot;
the launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that over@@ load the server .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go more users than T@@ inder and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , players are going to be followed by their smart@@ phones outside and search for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons which were followed by a GPS and once they have been found &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( about a screen@@ shot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game as she was still younger , joined the W@@ ahn and rang out for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the United States the game led to a considerable rise in steps , which the &quot; average &quot; person every day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ og@@ ram , an app for Apple Watch , the 35.@@ 000 users reported recently , that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of people followed by 45 percent to 53 per cent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays on Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only looks the rough data for the power efficiency .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns to health , people want to bring about 30 minutes &quot; to get &quot; &quot; from the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; every day , &quot; &quot; from the sofa to come &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; every day , because many public messages to be boring and come from people who are working . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be over@@ rated . &quot;
&quot; who regularly drives sport , reduces its chances to climb to cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits , which is too long to lead them here . &quot;
&quot; but the wonder@@ full of Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors , that makes them fun . &quot;
&quot; thus three pillars of health covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun . &quot;
some people are close to hunting even new friend@@ ships .
&quot; as always , there are also m@@ ess game modes , who always have to complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could walk against a door . &quot;
what should it be ?
it has become a breakthrough .
&quot; even if smartphone apps were already following our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to do sports as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its attraction and the use will leave with time .
&quot; because of poker success , however , there will be more games to unite apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world and will help many people on hunting , active , f@@ itter and health@@ ier . &quot;

she broke out in t@@ ears as their final result and her long journey into this moment an end took place .
&quot; this success puts it in the same le@@ ague as unique athletes , such as Michael P@@ helps , which brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years their athle@@ te , including 10 gold medals - including ten gold medals - with so amazing exercises that the Olympi@@ asi@@ tism of 1984 Mary Lou rescue on from her said that she is &quot; the best tur@@ ner@@ in which I have ever seen . &quot;
&quot; it was expecting a final test in Brazil , a competition , which was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;

&quot; according to police report that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 year old girl were shot in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first series of seri@@ al fall , while they heard in the car and heard of music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Lin@@ er , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot up on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked on 12 June . &quot;
the perpet@@ rated hum@@ bled eight shots from a hand@@ ler weapon while he stood on the passenger side of the car and fle@@ w with another vehicle in the report .
&quot; the police told that the triple murder not seem to be the result of a space over@@ crowded , as the att@@ acker did not have the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who found themselves in possession of one of the adult victims . &quot;
&quot; the police spok@@ es@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting with the investig@@ ators exc@@ eeded the closer look , whether she is connected with four previous attacks . &quot;

&quot; it is assumed that the susp@@ ects several vehicles has used , including a brown Nis@@ sans from the late 1990s , a black BMW in the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln . &quot;
&quot; the medi@@ ator ref@@ used , the evidence of off@@ ences that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and were committed by the same mur@@ derer . &quot;

mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; it gets better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old loves Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ uto , the singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but as the least of his Alter@@ aries has enjoyed Ed@@ mund micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ uto during their pregnancy nothing knew . &quot;
&quot; when he came home for the first time , my first thought I made this not . &quot;
I made this not .
I did not let myself stop .
&quot; what is wrong at all -- of course one has left to it , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; her husband Vincent and her was told that Ed@@ mund it can never recognize them , and that he may not even survive . &quot;
some doctors even went so far that they sm@@ ote him to institution@@ alize him .
&quot; my first answer to it &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &quot; &quot; explained Pic@@ ci@@ uto . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of a wal@@ ker .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit or dis@@ ab@@ ling up to his third year and he can still not speak .
but he slowly makes progress .
he can run with support and cycling .
he also loves to play with his two brothers and sing .
Elizabeth shows the character that Ed@@ mund for &quot; Please sing something in front of me . &quot;
&quot; we bring him a string at &quot; , &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ uto CB@@ S News . &quot;
but it is not a typical character -- tells her . Ed@@ mund has inv@@ ented some characters alone .
&quot; Micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund , as well as infections with viruses such as masks or the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy . &quot;
the symptoms and progn@@ oses can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how to influence the life of using the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus in@@ infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ uto is remin@@ is@@ cent of the emotional price of an un@@ familiar future .
&quot; I asked , what will happen ? &quot;
what will happen ?
and they don &apos;t know it yet .
&quot; I have been asked for a long time after the progn@@ osis , because I don &apos;t expect them to really tell me . &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ uto has a hop@@ eful advis@@ ement for Mothers of inf@@ ants with birth damage caused by the z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus .
it is better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .

&quot; Mah@@ aj Brown , 6 , &quot; by balls over@@ holes &quot; , &quot; survi@@ ved shooting in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police shares with that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week the second time is already shot a 6 @-@ year child . &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boys identified him for CB@@ S Philadelphia as Mah@@ aj Brown .
&quot; the grand@@ parents gave that Brown several sh@@ red@@ ness suffered , including in the lungs , legs , arm and belly , but that he was with his transport to the hospital in consciousness . &quot;
&quot; he has done a lot , his small body was gone by balls and shared his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ illa Mel@@ ende@@ z the transm@@ itter with . &quot;
I can not believe it .
the condition of the boy was perceived in a hospital as a critical and he had to sign up several operations .
the family of the boys shared the radio station with that he is expected to sei@@ ze again .
he should have started the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
&quot; also , three men were killed : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
one of the 29 @-@ year men is in critical state ; the other two victims are according to CB@@ S Philadelphia in stable state .
&quot; the boy was found on the front of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old , which is found in a critical condition , covers the transm@@ itter . &quot;
the other two victims were not found in the car and the police find whether one of the most recent men of the perpet@@ rators could be .
conduc@@ tors shared CB@@ S Philadelphia with that it seems to have come to a cross country between several sho@@ oter .
&quot; pat@@ ron@@ utri@@ ents for assault ri@@ sts , which were trac@@ ed to various overthrow of storm , over@@ se@@ ated the Tat@@ location . &quot;
it seems that it is clear to negoti@@ ated a long @-@ term struggle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the road , we found themselves . &quot;
&quot; so it appears here several armed fighters to have given , who were very active involved , the police skin @-@ p@@ mann Anthony G@@ inal di the police in Philadelphia transm@@ itter . &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
&quot; there was no fixed , and the police currently reviewed reports according to the surveillance video . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ year girl was hit by a cross @-@ stick on the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential O@@ ak Lane . &quot;
she recovered and the police still looking for a sus@@ pic@@ ion .
why we need Simone V@@ Gab@@ by and Laur@@ ie need
that is what I am in the turn of the Frauen@@ olymp@@ ic Council in the Tur@@ ns and this for more than one reason .
&quot; first , I have been doing so since 1984 at every summer Olymp@@ ics , and the US has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; and secondly : this team has three turbin@@ es , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Dou@@ glas and Laur@@ en &quot; Laur@@ ie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ de@@ z who inspir@@ es for many young girls from other skin colour . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man , the J@@ ü@@ din , and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the cath@@ o@@ lik@@ in is , abr@@ asive , makes every pride . &quot;
this team is finally reflected in the USA .
it has passed the black and his@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one under the feminine turbin@@ es was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Dou@@ glas was a surprising Olympic Olympi@@ ast@@ ew@@ inn@@ erin and America rejo@@ ic@@ ed .
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the unbeliev@@ able world championship of Simone Bil@@ es , Dou@@ glas and Laur@@ ie Her@@ nan@@ de@@ z as she was un@@ expected , but master@@ y g@@ ym@@ ers rout@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Simone was Simone the fourth , heter@@ os@@ exual Americans , which won in an individual multi @-@ stage event for women Gold . &quot;
team member of A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man won silver .
&quot; we experience the top of this sport , but so do not see in the entire country . &quot;
Simone , Gab@@ by and Laur@@ ie swal@@ low all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to create it into the Olympic Team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; &quot; last five &quot; , &quot; because the next Olymp@@ ics have only four turbin@@ es in the team . moreover , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality look like that turn a te@@ ar sport is and Tur@@ ner in the first line of private spaces , which will be sustained for training , insights , travel , travel , and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their Tur@@ ner and families ) . the list can be continued at any time . &quot;
the majority of these rotation are in wealth@@ y suburbs that can support business .
&quot; in these verses , the Tur@@ ner receive their full training and that is for families an expensive and long @-@ term engagement . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , Train@@ ers of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , Train@@ ers of Laur@@ ie Her@@ nan@@ de@@ z , both have trained their athletes , since they started with the tur@@ ning . &quot;
&quot; we have to be inspired to the congreg@@ ations au@@ n countless , young girls that are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Laur@@ ie , a powerful and easier access to exercise . &quot;
I was founded my turn@@ out of 20 years .
&quot; with my events , we have free and affordable Tur@@ ning in Harlem for about 15,000 urban young people ( especially black and his@@ pan@@ ese ) , and national and international winner . &quot;
&quot; in September , we will exp@@ ands to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to provide the youth high quality turn to learn from this great olymp@@ ic sport . &quot;
&quot; Tur@@ ning develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the spirit . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health and educational and professional success .
&quot; it is the inspiration of this team that bring thousands of young girls to care for the turn , and that &apos;s great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to participate in sport , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Laur@@ ie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ es of the Olympic Mann@@ ende and thank you , F@@ ass her so many young girls with different background motivated to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
&quot; assist@@ ants would like to organize another strike , after having rejected Jer@@ emy Hun@@ ts proposal . &quot;
&quot; the ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the changes made by adop@@ ting a reform@@ ist contract with the functioning of the British Medical Association , but 58 per cent of the 37.@@ 000 assist@@ ants who sent him on a choice to bor@@ row@@ ed him . &quot;
&quot; in July , H@@ unt plans had revealed to introduce the contract inev@@ it@@ ably and said that the NH@@ S could be harmful in one &quot; &quot; Ni@@ em@@ ech@@ land &quot; &quot; and any further delay in the employees and patients would be harmful . &quot;
&quot; the first assistant of assist@@ ants should receive a new contract , which contains changes to night and weekends , in order to improve care of ung@@ ast@@ able movements . &quot;
&quot; DR &apos;s Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A committee for assist@@ ants shared last night in a communication with : &quot; assist@@ ants to the proposed contract after just before serious concerns , in particular that it will treat the current availability crisis and it is administ@@ ered to treat all doctors . &quot;
&quot; at only eight weeks , the remaining group of doctors will remain under the new contract , must be made progress and time is running out . &quot;
efforts on the part of the BM@@ A to resolve the dispute over talks in the government for the sake of the government to take part and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
&quot; it came to pass that of a promise , Jer@@ emy H@@ unt has made the last month that his door would always be off@@ ended . &quot;
Jer@@ emy H@@ unt has to act now to raise the condition and concerns the concerns of assist@@ ants .
&quot; should he not do this , so we have clearly done the assistant of assist@@ ants that they are willing to perform further working @-@ magne@@ tism . &quot;
&quot; the last strike in late April saw a record of nearly 13.@@ 000 Rout@@ ine@@ operations and 100.000 terminals , as nur@@ ses and practition@@ ers were involved in order to provide doctors on the strike chain . &quot;
the ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute over changes by adop@@ ting the reform@@ ist contract with the functioning of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the BM@@ A wants a better weekly payment for the 54.@@ 000 assistant , which will be subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , Direc@@ tor@@ ate @-@ Director of the NH@@ S employees , called for assist@@ ants to end the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; labour @-@ magne@@ tism hin@@ ts nothing of the only little , but already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patients , nur@@ sing and their families just worries , dist@@ ress and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; over the last two months , we talked to the committee of assist@@ ants and talked about the health of assistant as well as other minist@@ ries , positive to concerns with regard to the hand @-@ hand and of the wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; employers hop@@ ed that the continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as Ent@@ ries , flexibility in training , training courses , mutual recognition of the cur@@ riculum , training session , and gender equality in medicine - a sign of how serious it was the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health relating to compliance with BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;
the £ 2 @-@ per day drug that can reduce cardiovascular disease
thousands of cardiovascular patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug which was recommended by the authorities to administ@@ er this more people for a longer period of time .
the sculp@@ tor drug Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeti@@ tive heart inf@@ ectious diseases for people with a flo@@ wering disease .
&quot; the drug is administ@@ ered for 12 months after a heart attack , thus reducing the risk of a stroke or a further heart attack . &quot;
the regulatory authorities of the NH@@ S has recommended for four years in order to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the regulatory authorities of the NH@@ S has recommended for four years in order to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack and a quarter of it suffer another heart attack or stroke . &quot;
&quot; heart attack and stroke will be caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the arter@@ ies , the Bel@@ ts form . &quot;
&quot; when the Bel@@ ag apart , it may cause a blood @-@ breaking , causing the blood flow towards the heart and thus caused a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood circulation is rede@@ emed , it can flow through the blood flow and hide the blood flow towards the brain , which causes a stroke . &quot;
&quot; individuals who had already had a heart attack , subject to a higher risk . &quot;
&quot; Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ cen@@ eca , and under the Bri@@ li@@ que Bri@@ li@@ que is reduced , reduces this risk by increasing the formation of blood@@ shed . &quot;
&quot; the attraction of nice , which has been published today , recommen@@ ds a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , director of the nice health prevention centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons who suffered a heart attack , another heart attack or stroke - often with dis@@ astro@@ us consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack may have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in effectively in reducing other inf@@ ectious diseases and stroke in people who had already had a heart attack .
&quot; thanks to a pro@@ visional recommendation from Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options for thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;
the information on the eff@@ ic@@ acy and safety of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the blood risk - is limited to a period of up to three years . the check @-@ out recommen@@ ds no treatment that goes beyond that period .
culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness leaves elect@@ rom@@ echan@@ ics in Muslim regions
the former may@@ or of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was founded last year on aband@@ on@@ ment of a government report because of corruption
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has resulted in that far @-@ widespread constitu@@ ency in mus@@ lim@@ ische municipalities are ignor@@ ant as a cr@@ ushing government report today revealed .
&quot; the former Cab@@ inet member Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es it attacks the police , elect@@ oral and Rath@@ ent@@ ines that evidence of elect@@ oral abuse due to &quot; super@@ sensitivity to ethnic and religion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former minister of integration and commun@@ al@@ government , who now is a face @-@ cor@@ rupt point , said that the in@@ tim@@ id@@ ation of voters from religious moti@@ fs would be permitted , that the police should be allowed to set off @-@ out outside of elect@@ ors to hold swit@@ ched voters . &quot;
he recommen@@ ds that voters should lead a reference to themselves in elections to prove their identity .
currently there must be a voters only to name his name and address .
&quot; the report suggests , not dist@@ or@@ able ink on the finger of a person if they make their choices , to prevent somebody cho@@ oses twice . &quot;
wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers should get more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he calls for the press more access to communities and decisions of not official compens@@ ations or working groups .
&quot; this is not only against elect@@ oral fraud , but also the municipal government before the broader cor@@ rupt - and financial fraud culture , which goes with it , he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by the down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets El@@ sk@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
&quot; last year , a Special Tribunal that the may@@ or Mayor Lut@@ sk Rah@@ man after a lit@@ ude to cor@@ rupt and illegal practices of his ministers . &quot;
the court was that Rah@@ man could per@@ c@@ ate the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in the same manner and that he had brought his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bi@@ .org .
&quot; Rah@@ man shall have led &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the rel@@ ig@@ ous duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
&quot; up to 300 voices were either des@@ perate or the result of a im@@ itation , when one person cho@@ oses a person as someone else . &quot;
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence of fraud across the country .
&quot; in particular , he expressed particularly al@@ arm@@ ing to frau@@ dul@@ ent letters - in the older members of the Muslim Community have made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , made , made several recommendations to attract the elect@@ oral system , including the filling of point@@ ing to prove the identity &quot;
&quot; in his report it is said : &quot; &quot; being proof that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been practic@@ ed , particularly women and young people , in order to vote in accordance with the welcome of the elders , especially communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ic or ban@@ ed@@ ging background . &quot;
&quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions have such a conduct based on &quot; politically correct &quot; beliefs concerning the eth@@ never and religion ignor@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to s@@ cour@@ ge the system , including the pro@@ hibition that political activists , edit , to stop &quot; &quot; campaigns &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also demands t@@ oug@@ her registr@@ ations , to prevent the election of the election of Im@@ migrants and social behavior purposes . &quot;
consider options to ask voters before your choice after your reference .
&quot; not remo@@ able ink on the finger of a person , once she has given her voice to prevent that somebody cho@@ oses twice . &quot;
systematic emp@@ athy over the nationality of a person to ensure that they are optional .
a three @-@ year limit for applications on an automatic mail@@ code .
pro@@ hibition that political activists can edit complete letters and envel@@ op@@ es of letters .
the police give the authority to set off @-@ ups for elect@@ oral stations .
&quot; a legislative change , which makes an indic@@ t@@ ment due to in@@ tim@@ id@@ ation according to the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( referendum law 1983 ) . &quot;
photography offered in elect@@ oral stations .
request that only English may be used in the elect@@ oral stations ( except for Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the staff will rule en@@ force their voters alone into the choice .
Sir Eric falls over the Metrop@@ olitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case have no penalty show .
&quot; the Court of the Court has been Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his dep@@ uty for a lit@@ ude to cor@@ rupt , and illegal practices described as un@@ avo@@ idable , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons , it was recognised by a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings . &quot;
he also cri@@ tici@@ zed the effective &quot; bott@@ om@@ ous controls &quot; of the town of the Rath@@ o .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court @-@ sur@@ t in Tower Ham@@ lets from the last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country bears as the mother of parli@@ aments a proud heritage , but the wor@@ rying and covered spread of elect@@ oral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy for K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ double @-@ predec@@ essor and other famous Doppel@@ gänger ers of Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ als in Rio
fans of the Olympi@@ ad 2016 in Rio are made this week about the French bike spor@@ ty Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Prev@@ ot except the edge and band who has proved an impressive dual @-@ predec@@ essor in the Duke of Cambridge .
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year Olympi@@ oni@@ kin is by far not the only one to don@@ ate the Gold milit@@ ant Ath@@ let , who has its own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not , if you may believe the social media belief . &quot;
&quot; to honor the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces , the FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a lists of Olympi@@ ans , which have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with a lot of the most famous . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ unters and the Wolf : team member of the American team in the Archery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio . &quot;
&quot; except K@@ ates semi @-@ predec@@ essor on the rad@@ r@@ enn@@ bahn , many people aged on the Internet , as a certain arch@@ ief for the Zw@@ illing of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio could be . &quot;
&quot; the team member of the American team in the Archery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a crash on Twitter after pictures , on which he looks similar to Wolf of Wall Street Star . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the bow@@ el got the ins@@ an@@ ity in the social media with and gave to hear that he has already heard since his childhood he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I myself do not see great simil@@ arity with the exception of facial hair , distributed Bra@@ dy of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I felt it as compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly occur even more into the focus : the simil@@ arity between the British W@@ eit@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; the Russian Tur@@ ner@@ in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with its great , expres@@ sive eyes should be performed as a double @-@ predec@@ essor for the American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
and in the swimming pool the south African swi@@ mmer Cameron is compared with the G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison .
&quot; one course higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; of the IN@@ C@@ EP@@ TION Schauspiel@@ ers &quot;
a further prolong@@ ed comparison has been drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ mut who is similar to heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian Silver med@@ a@@ ill@@ um@@ wi@@ m@@ mer@@ in Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova shows more than just the son@@ ic skin and te@@ ase hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ Cor@@ d on while the American Nathan Adrian from fans was attacked by an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gord@@ on Lev@@ itt . &quot;
&quot; strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jenni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar perspective and eyes &quot;
not the sp@@ icy : a Twitter @-@ user was very happy about that others are the simil@@ arities also .
theory in the room : according to this user there is a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple perhaps one reason
&quot; a Twitter User@@ in declared their satisfaction , that the rest of the internet thinks that Hope and Jenni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter is almost identical . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the U.S. football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jenni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter an incredibly similar perspective and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular compar@@ isons recorded Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is nearly identical with the act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney , as well as the gold med@@ alli@@ ons in the Tur@@ n Gab@@ by Dou@@ glas , which resem@@ bles its own wonderful , broad smile , which resem@@ bles that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle . &quot;

we quickly spent yesterday evening with our spect@@ ators on the show and our Fol@@ lo@@ wer@@ n in social media .
&quot; to define one , B@@ yr@@ s comments refer to the performance of swimm@@ ers and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were un@@ reasonable and un@@ happy wor@@ ding wor@@ ding . By@@ ron does that which he has said , very sorry . &quot;

buyer in Pri@@ mark emp@@ tor about woman who tried in the midst of business under@@ wear under@@ wear
&quot; the buyers not did not know where they should be seen , as a woman moved their clothes in the midst of a Pri@@ mark to try shelter . &quot;
&quot; to wor@@ sen the situation , it looked like it looked in it , she moved out and put them back into the shelf . &quot;
you continue on and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place mall in Folk@@ estone .
&quot; Pri@@ mark Business in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place mall in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tried the sub@@ ordin@@ arily , before she put it back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ d@@ son , who was at the same time in business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the under@@ wear , &quot; she turned out again and left the business without buying anything . &quot;
she said : &quot; people could not believe what they saw . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the floor standing , she took a pair under@@ pants from the out@@ land , moved their own Stru@@ ment@@ or and tried them out . &quot;
&quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a somewhat discreet place to do it - they just stood there , fre@@ ch like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; every rigi@@ d , when she turned the sub@@ h@@ osen again , who obviously did not like them , as they put them into the shelf . &quot;
she repeated the same with three other sub@@ titles before she finally decided that you have nothing liked to do again and went down again .
&quot; it did not seem to distur@@ b that she would be able to consider someone - or think about the person , which under circumstances the sub@@ h@@ osen would buy them tried . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent lives , said : &quot; &quot; how contra@@ dic@@ tory to think that someone had h@@ osen up home , who had a different person and which were not washed . &quot;
the inci@@ dent occurred on Tuesday in the morning .
&quot; Mrs. Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; &quot; as I got , the staff tries to pull the clothing pieces from the sale , after she went - what is just as good . &quot;
&quot; I would hate to go home with a new couple , to go home and find out that a different woman she had and again walked and they were not washed away . &quot;
&quot; a speaker of Pri@@ mark said , &quot; Pri@@ mark is the inci@@ dent , which took place on Tuesday , 9 August in our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from ceas@@ ing attacks
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of air@@ crafts could make it more secure for you . &quot;
&quot; we talked to Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Verb@@ s in New York to find out how to move with armed inc@@ ense . &quot;
&quot; whether you approach from the front or back from the rear , this video will show you how you turn off for your rob@@ bers . &quot;
&quot; if you turn to you from the rear , then you should turn to the first turn , so you can see your att@@ ack@@ ers and move out of the bas@@ eline , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
gra@@ b the weapon then between your front and your shoulder before you hit him with your free Ell@@ bow to face .
&quot; then hit him then with the knee in the body and turning it , while the att@@ acker d@@ ashed before pain , the weapon from his hands . strike it with the run into the face and move back down@@ wards as they set the weapon to him . &quot;
&quot; at att@@ ack@@ ers that approach from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the line , gra@@ b the weapon and turn it , so that the att@@ acker can not shoot . &quot;
&quot; simultaneously , you can shift the weight on the weapon and hit the att@@ acker on the chest , then rot@@ ate the weapon from his handle before they move back@@ wards and set the weapon to it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?

Rei@@ di Ian W@@ right sch@@ fted for a guide leader his tongue at the most dirty places of Europe
a British matur@@ ity re@@ pul@@ led his immune system and wor@@ ger@@ ef@@ lex in a serious examination - by doing some of the most dirty and ek@@ ar@@ est places in Europe .
&quot; the moder@@ ator and author Ian Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k sh@@ aded its course on a Euro shock , a nest on the Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a dishwasher at a tractor and a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resistance of its immune system . &quot;
&quot; before the l@@ ending of any object he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer , to show up and show us on what he will beh@@ ave . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment made under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was fil@@ med , brought some surprising results to day@@ light . &quot;
&quot; the thought to check the dishwasher , which was already used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but actually are in a kitchen wash@@ es more bad bacteria . &quot;
on his journey through Europe Mr. W@@ right said Mr W@@ right with physicians and medical professionals across the promotion of Dar@@ mb@@ bacteria and his own health .
&quot; luck@@ ily , nothing left what he shi@@ fted , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
&quot; Mr W@@ right has been known to test the res@@ ili@@ ency of his intest@@ ine by the world rich@@ est and peculi@@ ar as well as wonderful things . &quot;
&quot; from public funds to train stations to dish@@ washers of toilets , the task set his immune system definitely under a sample . &quot;
&quot; he told in the movie : &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned what my health concerns and I have raised all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud @-@ water . &quot;
in the film he became his reputation in any case .
&quot; the funny what he ref@@ used , was a dirty public toilet in Russia . &quot;
his pro@@ w@@ ed showed a le@@ umin@@ ous value of over 4000 units .
&quot; compared to this , the L@@ umin@@ om@@ eter@@ value is fresh washed hands less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet , which he ref@@ used to check out after their L@@ umin@@ om@@ eter@@ isation over 4000 units was , while fresh washed hands one of less than 60 . &quot;
Mr. W@@ right and Finnish manufacturers of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the film film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; which shows the bacter@@ ium in different places like the bathroom
&quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; this comes the worst , which I used in a toilet , near . &quot;
there is no dirt than that !
&quot; I will not hide anything here , because it is in@@ adequate here . &quot;
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company st@@ acked Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o free@@ ze as well as vitamin C and D as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of bacteria and immune system .
&quot; Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; we wanted to offer the consumers really something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time the benefits of pro@@ biot@@ ics explains .
&quot; we led crazy Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings through which we end@@ owed , that we said &quot; &quot; L@@ ass us Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in Darm@@ stadt is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment , the importance of the intest@@ inal health and how it is associated with the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in the intest@@ inal health is a global phenomenon and with a documentary we could provide more information on an interesting way .
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the ra@@ iny of the film , added : &quot; &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had spoken to him , just like the ek@@ el@@ ty Russian toilet , which is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course there were things , in which it was easier to bring Ian to bring them up , and others , in which this was quite difficult . &quot;
I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty deeds .
&quot; in one of Vali@@ dat@@ o , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents were also associated with the wellness of stomach and intest@@ ine , in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ine and 58 percent , that they are at least occasionally used products that have attached milk @-@ bacter@@ ial bacteria . &quot;
A@@ Social Family destro@@ ys in front of Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ening Social @-@ apartments in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; an immig@@ rant family left her social @-@ apartment after a dolph@@ ins , with a damage in the amount of £ 5@@ 0,000 because they had terror on its neighbours . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Sk@@ el@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after being rolled out of their property , the property was shock@@ ed in an ir@@ repar@@ able state . &quot;
&quot; the walls referred to , wooden holes have been upgra@@ ded , tr@@ ash was converted to the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was decorated to walls . &quot;
the family were rel@@ oc@@ ated and it is believed that she is now living in a private accommodation
&quot; Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ asion , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall Housing , said that they are afraid that the apartment is no longer rep@@ aired . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare and I believe that people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot;
there are many things to consider since this property is probably not as beautiful part Corn@@ walls .
the family is advis@@ able and its reputation is it also .
&quot; the couple had three sons , who lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror that had put the family , stre@@ aming with bas@@ eb@@ all@@ ers , drug abuse , drug @-@ abuse and dis@@ counted sli@@ ding , st@@ wid@@ ths and flu@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; Sk@@ el@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease agreement , got a arrangement for anti social behaviour in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which may be dem@@ ol@@ ished in some circumstances , old g@@ arb@@ age was found . &quot;
&quot; were tra@@ ded in the property , where drugs have been tra@@ ded in the past drugs , the wood@@ crafts . &quot;
neighbours told that they had to fight them on the street and to reach the police regularly
&quot; Corn@@ wall Housing Hi@@ del@@ o@@ gi@@ fted it and its partners this week from the property , after they gave them a prolong@@ ed period of 11 weeks to voluntary . &quot;
&quot; Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation were pra@@ ised by light@@ ened neighbours , who said that their lives was made to hell . &quot;
&quot; one said , &quot; &quot; They came to anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years apart from them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are amazing .
&quot; today , we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet - we are not used here !
&quot; now , where they are finally away , it will be nice . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , neighbourhood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that it would have administ@@ ered the family to cooperate with local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house , to which the police was called in regular intervals , 20 years long . &quot;
on the covered side of the congreg@@ ation @-@ house were cast out g@@ arb@@ age and old toys .
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame that it administ@@ ered the ten@@ ant to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family , since a Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation is always the last step is the Corn@@ wall Housing . &quot;
&quot; this was a very difficult case , since the behaviour was extremely difficult and their deeds had to be aw@@ ful for their neighbours . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the church who have come to us and have provided us the information you have made . &quot;
I hope that the development of some neighbours will sp@@ ends and the message con@@ veys that anti @-@ social behavior is not toler@@ ated .
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons have lived at different times in the house , but that they are all over 20 . &quot;
&quot; a dirty mattress , let go back in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation on the ground . &quot;
workers of the household administration will now have the g@@ arb@@ age of g@@ arb@@ ons which sur@@ round the house
&quot; in 2014 , the police led a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as sc@@ ales , par@@ ap@@ ors and cash at the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Sk@@ el@@ don has received a money penalty after they had found guilty of the owner of a threat of class B in trade union .
&quot; she said that the money for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Sk@@ el@@ don be , who died in 2013 with an automobile accident . &quot;
&quot; after they were without shelter , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many rooms of the house were covered with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police tells us that they will be ten@@ ant who do not keep themselves to the land@@ order .
Angela Cro@@ w shared by the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall shared a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not keep themselves in the house order .
&quot; this goes to those who can think that without self @-@ ordin@@ ances , as well as those who were damaged by such a behavior , &quot; she said . &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour which continues to cooperate with partners to protect our communities .

&quot; thus the World Grand Sl@@ am &quot; &quot; Golden Grand Sl@@ am &quot; with success at World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour @-@ Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and just Olympia . &quot;
bronze went to Japanese Jun @-@ ut@@ ani .
the two Chinese have made it as expected in the end@@ game and made the title each other .
&quot; in this way , it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese record would pick up the single title in the sign of the Five rings . &quot;
last non @-@ Chinese on the top Olympia po@@ dium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Leg@@ ion@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; Ma and Z@@ hang were on the record alone , between the movements and Time @-@ outs they had no co@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; they had with@@ drawn to the tri@@ b@@ une , and left their us@@ efulness in fair competition alone . &quot;
&quot; the Mat@@ ches to here , I have played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the finale I play for me , I had said Z@@ hang gr@@ ated . &quot;
after the parti@@ tioned gold and silver med@@ alli@@ sts with China @-@ F@@ ah@@ ne .
the match itself was un@@ expected .
ma had really struggling with his 28 @-@ year opponent only in the first set .
&quot; after that , certain he had the pace on the record and left Z@@ hang out there only a total of 13 points . &quot;
by the su@@ peri@@ ority of Ma did not develop the expected match .
&quot; however , however , there were enough breath @-@ change to be seen . &quot;
Miz@@ ut@@ ani won the game of bronze against the 40 @-@ year Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
&quot; the white rus@@ se had moved in his quarter @-@ fin@@ als against the German Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ ah@@ char@@ ov , was subsequently moved into a medical treatment , had to be &quot; ultimately &quot; with Ble@@ ch . &quot;
the Sweden Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Pers@@ son ( 42 / 2008 ) were very similar to a high level of table Olymp@@ ics .
Donald Tru@@ mp sp@@ t ″ rolled @-@ rolled problems ″ in the election campaign
the leadership of the U.S. re@@ public@@ ans is concerned by massive worries , also in traditional conservative federal states to put their majority . &quot;
presidential committee Donald Tru@@ mp was now available weaknesses of his election campaign in the former Republi@@ can Hoch@@ burg U@@ tah .
&quot; a rare moment , in which the usually large @-@ scale and self @-@ confident m@@ ultim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire had something like concerns expressed as correspon@@ dents . &quot;
&quot; after he cast 16 ri@@ vals within the own Republi@@ can camp , now the doubts about his success in the fight for the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have tremendous issues in U@@ tah , &quot; said Tru@@ mp before evangel@@ ical Christians , which he asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; blame were false reports of his candi@@ d@@ acy , he took again his known medi@@ ums . &quot;
Republi@@ can St@@ ack@@ ers w@@ ack@@ ers
U@@ tah is usually a safe bank for re@@ public@@ ans .
&quot; a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ USA from June , according to Tru@@ mp and his ri@@ vals of Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , &quot;
&quot; other institutes see Tru@@ mp in front , but not by far the distance , which are common for Republi@@ can candidates in the federal state . &quot;
as endangered also Arizona and Georgia are also applicable .
&quot; in an interview of the Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC answered Tru@@ mp on the question , as he asked to stop the Vor@@ mar@@ sch Clin@@ tons : &quot; just as I have done it so far . &quot;
&quot; and if behind : this will be &quot; &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot;
he do not make things different than &quot; the truth . &quot;
&quot; if it is not rich for him at the end of the sake of political correctness , be the right , said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to the pres@@ tige , the party of Tru@@ mp should be pushed to st@@ opping funds for the support of his election campaign , he should not be able to present any better re@@ plac@@ ements . &quot;
instead of taking the candidates of re@@ public@@ ans for the Congress stronger among the arms .

in orch@@ ester the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ onic Di@@ ri@@ gen@@ te Gust@@ av@@ o D@@ ud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm . &quot;
we always say that they are very colorful .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and mel@@ ody .
it is a wonderful mix that is the perfect recipe for our orch@@ estra .
I would say that we have amber music really in our blood !
&quot; in this st@@ aging , Bart@@ oli plays a older ch@@ wor@@ den@@ e Maria . &quot;
she reminds with melanch@@ ol@@ y to her beloved with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and d@@ anced . &quot;
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
&quot; first , because they are musi@@ cally exceptional ! &quot;
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
&quot; so it is clever , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; they resem@@ bles me very , my Italian character I have as Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; laugh@@ s Bart@@ oli . &quot;

it is an enormous amount of human beings .
&quot; and Bart@@ oli gives the compli@@ ment back : &quot; &quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
rigi@@ d is a necessity for him .
&quot; you see it in any of his movements , in his legs , it is his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a happy approach to life , which is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for the American director of Philip WM . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; , &quot; in this piece it is about pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
&quot; today we did the refugees , then the Pu@@ ph@@ ans went to New York , and the New York inhabitants did not want them to do . &quot;
&quot; they are the same topics , and they are as meaningful today as at that time . &quot;
59 years later the piece is still relevant .

the Kur@@ dish municipality of Germany expects short @-@ term protection who fle@@ e from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; in the medium term , there could be even &quot; some hundreds of hundreds , the association &apos;s front @-@ sitting Ali top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; due to the hard approach of the Turkish president Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an after the coup , the Kur@@ dish Municip@@ ality expects a mass escape to Germany . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term I reck@@ less with ten thousand , medium @-@ term protection from Turkey in Germany , when the Erd@@ og@@ an regime change the minorities and democratic opposition to be comb@@ ated &quot; , &quot; says the St@@ rob@@ ber Ali top@@ ra@@ k in the &quot; World &quot; of Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government already went through Kur@@ dish strong@@ holds with criminal actions , be 500,000 Kur@@ ds within Turkey on the run . &quot;
after the deteri@@ or@@ ated coup are still sec@@ ular and op@@ position@@ al ethnic towers .
many will want to start in Europe when they become more supp@@ res@@ sed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state , the self under@@ taking refugees in their own country , &quot; said top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the Verb@@ and@@ ef st@@ alled the targeted settlement of Syrian Arab Arabs , but in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities . &quot;
hence Erd@@ og@@ an wants to raise the imp@@ etus to the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armenia and Greeks have already been mo@@ cked out over the past hundred years or sold , &quot; said top@@ ra@@ k , which is also the CD@@ U member . &quot;
the association called for the Federal Government to position itself as sharp as Austria against Erd@@ og@@ an and its followers .
also in Germany there is a &quot; wit@@ ch@@ hunting &quot; against Erd@@ og@@ an @-@ Cri@@ tics .
in the past few months I do not feel safe in Germany for the first time .
the German branch of the goods movement also fear@@ ed the flight of many Tur@@ ks abroad .
&quot; more Tur@@ ks are searching for asylum in Germany , above all Kur@@ ds and op@@ position@@ ists . &quot;
the brand@@ ing as a goods @-@ trailers is destroyed and other acade@@ m@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; those who does not fit and Erd@@ og@@ an , s@@ its for packed caffeine , inci@@ dentally , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ nearby Foundation and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper reported in appeal on figures of the Federal Ministry of State , the Tur@@ ks presented before the coup the largest group of for political persecution approved asylum in Germany . &quot;
&quot; on June 30 , there were 11.@@ 386 people and therefore almost 29 per cent of all as a asylum entitled ( 39.@@ 625 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , it is not found before war , poverty , or pre@@ matur@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; asylum seek@@ ers according to the Basic Law are only politically , thus by government side , individually followed . &quot;
&quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; then go , where it we@@ aving &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals get nothing of the summer election with - and the holiday@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ West@@ p@@ hal@@ ia may not choose the country &apos;s day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they have understood .
&quot; to 2021 the land@@ mark will not come back right at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in parliament had already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; for more than so far , it is not : summer holidays , He@@ at , He@@ at , He@@ at , He@@ at , He@@ at . &quot;
&quot; the locals , who are to convince by the constitu@@ encies , are on vacation . &quot;
&quot; most of the holiday@@ makers who are in the land , on Us@@ edom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so are not allowed to choose the country &apos;s day . &quot;
&quot; these are practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ per , the post@@ ers to attach , ballo@@ ons , fl@@ yers and sit down at the end of the cast , just m@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
&quot; until 4 September 2016 , the elect@@ oral and last Feri@@ e@@ ag , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass over to the people at once again . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his office . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , since 1998 strongest party , is now in surveys clearly behind the CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; thr@@ illing is how strong Ne@@ ul@@ ing Aph@@ D cuts , and what remains the end of co@@ ali@@ tion@@ aug@@ ural . &quot;
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 ruling ef , makes an almost un@@ noticeable election campaign , one sees from his grand@@ children . &quot;
&quot; he travels through the country , divided ro@@ ses and chat a little with the people , as it also has its legend@@ ary liter@@ al predec@@ essor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , Seel@@ ering has got the old feet and are ch@@ anc@@ ellor Merkel the fault at the Af@@ gh@@ ing of the Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; your refu@@ gee policy , you &quot; &quot; We build this &quot; &quot; the ascent of the right @-@ op@@ uli@@ sts , which is likely to cost him a good position now . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with their Spit@@ s@@ ory data , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make the wrong time at the right place . &quot;
she has invited her pul@@ ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel ( German Chancellor Angela Merkel . ) Merkel ( German Bundestag ) is located in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the target group does not vote , there were more North@@ rh@@ ine @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Saxony as Mec@@ kl@@ en@@ burger and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority of other Länder , &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot;
&quot; but it is too bad to listen to the other Cor@@ ners of Germany , once Angela Merkel . &quot;
otherwise the North @-@ CD@@ U is disp@@ uted largely on the usual elect@@ oral stands on market grounds and in front of shopping centers with umbr@@ ell@@ as and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; so , co@@ con@@ ut , play only a &quot; sub@@ ordin@@ ate role . &quot;
&quot; also , the Union has reported that you are able to meet the base that it must be very rig@@ orous again to find a wire to the people again . &quot;
&quot; you are about the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the walls of the country barely there . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U Leg@@ isl@@ ators Kok@@ ert on his compassion is also self @-@ reve@@ aling , however , where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Gol@@ den@@ e Wed@@ dings , every Birth@@ day party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because a lot on the game stands , Sell@@ ering has now called its SPD to a particularly dedicated election campaign . &quot;
&quot; in case of surveys , the S &amp; Ds last with 22 percent behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and only just before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the election of 2011 , the SPD had still been made clear with 35,@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Green , Klein@@ part@@ ei with seven percent in the surveys have to set the le@@ ap into the agricultural day . &quot;
they make out of the holiday @-@ Not a modern virtu@@ e and moved their election as largely into the internet .
&quot; online election campaign , &quot; it is called the Landes@@ Presidency Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green elect@@ oral campaigns are on track @-@ looking for native stimulation among the tourists . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the Spit@@ enk@@ andi@@ d@@ atin , cur@@ ved just with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the mec@@ kl@@ en@@ burg@@ ische Lakes and finds it even beautiful . &quot;
&quot; your impression , &quot; &quot; holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ San@@ ation : restaurants suffer from blo@@ cking
&quot; at the speed , with which the B 27 is sandy , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible for construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30 o &apos;clock in the morning and only at 8 pm , there are all praise . &quot;
&quot; they made all pretty colorful , &quot; &quot; El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff tells of the jet gas station . &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no conflict .
&quot; the construction site could be planned at the beginning of the half @-@ time planned to the south , until the end of October everything will be ready . &quot;
&quot; the kid@@ neys of the entities will also be responsible for construction work , about when it comes to the establishment of containers . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site on Monday to the south , and also the blo@@ cking of the Asp@@ erg@@ or@@ straße in Of@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen is lifted and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is re@@ formed , the traffic situation within the place is relaxed . &quot;
citizens are now able to go back by Of@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 again .
the compensation through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were partly significant ail@@ ments , &quot; &quot; the management of the wrong management of the plumbing @-@ responsible leader Florian King . &quot;
&quot; the An@@ tig@@ ers of Bach@@ en@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ en street and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because lots of shame were examined and rather their Nav@@ i confidential than the sign@@ age . &quot;
what led to this that some truck in residential areas passed .
&quot; as well as the speed limit , the congreg@@ ation were not observed , the congreg@@ ation called for the trade show from M@@ ös@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; there were considerable transi@@ tions , &quot; says King , who himself made themselves on site about the situation . &quot;
there have been two to three per minute .
the quick@@ est was on the speed @-@ 30 @-@ hour at the speed @-@ 30 @-@ hour .
&quot; since the construction site , it has become more quiet yet . &quot;
&quot; for business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg now , the road is now open again . &quot;
business@@ men can look at the cards are not happy .
&quot; but that the B 27 @-@ san@@ itation has led to sales in its sales , everyone lets you look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some more and some are less affected . &quot;
&quot; who has nothing to do with the &quot; &quot; end customers &quot; , &quot; so for other companies , the san@@ itation is hardly any consequences . &quot;
&quot; also at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er Thomas Sul@@ z says Thomas Sul@@ z from a &quot; most light decline , &quot; but also a that of course &quot; the lear@@ ns is missing . &quot;
&quot; most exploited , the Local are the strongest along the road . &quot;
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only him , but all the pub have hit it &quot; hard . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it failed to protect the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ because . &quot;
we must be happy about each Euro sales .
&quot; the sales figures , he rose far more than 50 percent . &quot;
the stre@@ et@@ ation have thrown up its operation &quot; by two years . &quot;
half of his employees have to release .
&quot; if I would have had a company with 4000 employees and the half would have been released , the policy would have been respon@@ sive . &quot;
&quot; instead , government president Jörg Schmidt on a request of G@@ öh@@ ner , whether there could be a financial compensation , with the indication of the location on the B 27 Now they also benefit from the advantages of the location on the B 27 Now they even bear the down@@ sides that sur@@ render themselves through the renov@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Boh@@ em@@ ner white by other land circles , where such a large amount was dealt with . &quot;
&quot; in all cl@@ ays , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his Gast@@ stätte will continue to pass . &quot;
&quot; after all , family business has been settled in 17@@ 15 here , it refers to the long history . &quot;
&quot; however , other regul@@ ars now take less frequently to look out because of the complicated transportation management , it can understand . &quot;
&quot; if you cannot go down , it is also very different . &quot;
&quot; that its stem cell has returned after the end of the refurb@@ ishment , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with B@@ SE and N@@ öh@@ ler , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the impact of the B 27 files on his customer base for the greatest crisis which has experienced its hospitality in their long @-@ standing history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction work , that is already bru@@ tal . &quot;
constant in the name of the terrorist attack against laws is being smo@@ ked .
&quot; after the recent attacks , the Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère has now a th@@ icker safety package . &quot;
but what has a D@@ ul@@ atory status with terror ?
and what does the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ist say to all that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Rec@@ on@@ ner .
&quot; all his proposals were politically acceptable to the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ist &quot; politically , &quot; says the Federal Minister of Finance in the presentation of his new security package . &quot;
they are not calling anyone .
&quot; other , additional points would be discussed at first within the parties . &quot;
also remember myself .
but he was well located in results and at a &quot; achieved consensus &quot; within the Co@@ alition .
&quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , takes a little time after the recent attacks in Würz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach , before he presents his conclusions for the safety in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; however , the fall of this is all the more extensive . &quot;
&quot; some is already known , announced , announced that a new security authority in order to take care of the b@@ aking CON@@ TEN@@ D@@ Ü@@ SS@@ EL@@ TER communication is not new . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also , not the fact that Germany has to implement multiple EU guidelines on aviation data and weapons . &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the safety authorities is also not surprising .
&quot; partly de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , a second step for suggestions , who has not been going to do with the SPD so far : he wants sympath@@ etic to ter@@ organ groups under punishment and ji@@ hadi@@ sts with double citi@@ zenship in the German passport . &quot;
&quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; sp@@ atial the CD@@ U man . &quot;
&quot; however , he also kept this for reasonable and challenging nothing , what do not have any chances for the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ist . &quot;
a few new ideas present de Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
they have partly in itself : he plans quick procedures for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ ention of people in front of the deport@@ ation .
&quot; refugees who are targeted to the country , should give their smart@@ phones in advance and open social @-@ media accounts for a safety of security . &quot;
&quot; with D@@ ul@@ ae for exp@@ ired asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some worse than ever - about such , the crimes commit or their papers are aware of their identity . &quot;
some of them is political and legal .
some still appears un@@ balanced and leaves questions open .
and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of ge@@ dul@@ ed for example - is the question : what does this actually have to do with safety and terror ?
&quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the topics of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be in A@@ bre@@ de that the attacks from Ans@@ bach and Würz@@ burg refugees were .
&quot; in addition , many people in the face of the high refu@@ gee are concerned about safety . &quot;
&quot; and things that are deeply sad@@ dened by the people , and now they have not settled in the campaign . &quot;
the inner security is enormous in the focus .
&quot; only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach .
the temp@@ tation is great .
&quot; and yes , there are elect@@ oral struggles . &quot;
the European Union and the SPD can therefore become increasingly standing in position on the matter of internal security .
in the past few days it went up between the two parties .
&quot; only a gar@@ ev@@ ous argument about the equipment of the federal police , then via an safety @-@ policy collection of some Uni@@ ons , in which the Ress@@ ort@@ ons also call a Bur@@ ka ban , and a return from the double citi@@ zenship . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère would also be here to be re@@ conc@@ il@@ ful t@@ ints .
&quot; from a return from the double pass , he kept nothing . &quot;
we have spoken the discussion in Germany .
&quot; they are re@@ mod@@ elled , be not useful . &quot;
and with a bur@@ ka pro@@ hibition he has un@@ constitutional concerns .
&quot; whether its own package is un@@ constitutional and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; acceptable &quot; &quot; for the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ aries , must not yet be seen . &quot;
there is a lot inside what could be dispute .
but the SPD is currently trying to profile yourself in the subject of inner security .
&quot; Part@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alizes only for the conversation and says : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to security . &quot;
still Volkswagen g@@ limp@@ sed by .
&quot; despite diesel @-@ cutting , the exp@@ atri@@ ation pay worldwide . &quot;
but not in all markets it will run round .
in the call@@ back campaign there is vor@@ tex about a term .
Volkswagen starts with the delivery of delivery in the second half of the year .
&quot; Europe &apos;s largest high@@ ways may continue to advance a plus in the previous annual income , thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ running markets further . &quot;
&quot; but in July weak@@ ened the nuclear @-@ brand VW especially in Western Europe , and thus charged the overall sale , such as the D@@ ax not@@ ated companies . &quot;
&quot; we sold the brand VW in July with 4@@ 49@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales drives 14 percent below the previous year . &quot;
in the home @-@ market Germany saw the exclusion around almost a six@@ teenth .
&quot; brand@@ s@@ ef Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weak@@ ening figures from July above all on two sales days less in Europe . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it has given the result in some core markets through &quot; changing economic conditions &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the coup in Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ um will also be charged for the Australia from the EU , explained a speaker . &quot;
&quot; in the U.S. , where the g@@ arb@@ age first escal@@ ates , is also further a minus . &quot;
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; in total , the mainly affected house @-@ brand of the Lower Saxony continues to be carried out by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months only a dis@@ semin@@ inus from 0.6 percent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles are at Bu@@ che . &quot;
consolidated catalogue Fred Kap@@ pler was able to advance a sales platform from January to July .
&quot; 1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen at this time , around 5,@@ 904 million . &quot;
Volkswagen had manip@@ ulated with a software exhau@@ st tests .
&quot; alone in Germany , VW around 2.5 million cars calls for retro@@ fit into workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of conversion , VW , that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after the change@@ over the vehicles it will give fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor power no deteri@@ oration . &quot;
&quot; the motor@@ cycl@@ ist set the customer after the conversion , a &quot; Guarant@@ ee &quot; certificate , &quot; I do not speak of a &quot; warranty &quot; as it was on Friday in business circles . &quot;
the cause of legal enemies .
&quot; the &quot; focus &quot; had reported , Volkswagen @-@ waters now have a guarantee for sur@@ rendered diesel . &quot;
this would have confirmed the last Monday VW @-@ representative in the Federal Ministry of Defence .
&quot; from the traffic of traffic , it confirmed that there was this meeting . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; VW has completed the support of my investig@@ ational Commission and KBA &apos;s KBA . &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations of these are not accepted , &quot; &quot; declared Federal Minister Alexander d@@ ob@@ r@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has adopted the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor performance after the conversion , no deteri@@ or@@ ations will take place and all types of the relevant vehicle &apos;s value will have unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; but not as it was in business circles . &quot;
&quot; with the wide term &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; Volkswagen the possibility that customers can come for example a half year after the conversion , about with a motor damage in a workshop , even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; even in customer interest , it is important to avoid that in any case of any other damages , which does not have nothing to do with the ab@@ sc@@ andal on any guarantee of possible warranty claims , as it was called . &quot;
&quot; therefore , VW use the term &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the ra@@ i@@ ff@@ iz@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see is demanded by rich austerity in future - as a second institution in Germany .
&quot; Bank Josef Paul said on Thursday , &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers who want to park 40 million euros on gre@@ ens or day@@ light . &quot;
&quot; the Bundes@@ verband German banks speaks of a single case , and does not see a signal to pay normal &quot; &quot; austerity &quot; &quot; to pay for their austerity . &quot;
&quot; camps banks money on night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.4 per cent of criminal law . &quot;
&quot; this fee demands the ra@@ i@@ ff@@ tool@@ bank G@@ mund from September from private and corporate clients for deposits over 100,000 euros on gre@@ ens or day@@ light . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100.000 will cost 400 euros in the year , &quot; said Paul . &quot;
&quot; he has been lifted up to 40 million euros for a long time , which could be lifted from one day on the other and could not be able to explo@@ it . &quot;
&quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.01 percent cost , &quot; &quot; said the ban@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; I can not go for every million 4000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs he will now enter according to the cur@@ sor .
&quot; the cash simply lie in the Tres@@ oren of the ra@@ i@@ ff@@ iz@@ bank , would be much too dangerous : &quot; I have experienced &quot; four transi@@ tions , I don &apos;t like to have the fifth ! &quot; &quot; said the bank . &quot;
most customers had to have understanding and are rare to other plant forms .
just a few emig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; the co @-@ oper@@ atives of Bavaria declared : &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB causes significant costs in all banks . &quot;
&quot; if you are alone , &quot; &quot; business is not permanently possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some German banks therefore have increased their fees for account , credit cards or transfers . &quot;
&quot; with pro@@ secution for deposits from three million euros , the Thur@@ ing@@ ian National and ra@@ i@@ ff@@ iz@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land with its Skat@@ bank @-@ branch 2014 head@@ lines made . &quot;
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , main business leader of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t expect to pay private clients for deposits , this competition is much too strong in Germany under banks and savings banks . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a chin @-@ el , which is from the property somewhat l@@ ush . &quot;
&quot; this can become a small bank to become a problem , if they charge for free money . &quot;
&quot; the 1911 @-@ founded co @-@ oper@@ atives G@@ mund has two branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gladly , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; in the region , known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs . &quot;
&quot; currently , with the co @-@ oper@@ atives of Bavaria &quot; currently no further banks are known to calculate one application for deposits of private clients , &quot; said speakers of Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the President of the Federal Association of German People &apos;s State and Rai@@ ff@@ air@@ b@@ anks ( Bv@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared end June : &quot; the thres@@ hold , into neg@@ atives towards the private customers , is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; the competition was tough , and it threat@@ ens the emig@@ ration of embarrass@@ ing to the competition . &quot;
the customers in Germany will not be fallen in the width .
destination plates : who are to buy sound@@ proof@@ ed ?
lon@@ ely men face plates .
&quot; before you go to the commentary box , to exag@@ ger@@ ated him under the pse@@ ud@@ onym of non@@ al@@ lig@@ ator short@@ age with r@@ ust Bel@@ ei@@ c , this statement is derived from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the multip@@ lication of Schall@@ platten does not want to greet a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als who would like to greet the novel@@ ty of physical objects , but to the Mid@@ life nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who have recently purchased a record are of all pre@@ order according to the age between 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely cor@@ rid@@ or group . &quot;
it is also not a hor@@ des through hobby collectors - it has an emotional importance : older turn@@ tables retain their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; if this blog would be a news report on television , I would follow me the camera while in the midst of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a hum@@ ble gray ascent and wild , before I stop my hands and something poss@@ essing , saying , &quot; &quot; so , let &apos;s throw a closer look at it . &quot;
&quot; so , let us take a look at it . &quot;
&quot; even if the heart Soh@@ o slowly in its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent seller were located - there is still a hand@@ ful of fantas@@ tical disc . &quot;
I would probably ask the camer@@ aman to switch the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation .
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glas@@ gow , 55 , which I enter by S@@ ister Ray ( data count : eight young women , three men aged man ) into the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men aged man , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours . &quot;
is he a coll@@ ector ?
&quot; I already say , &quot; he says . &quot;
I have about 3.000 or 4.000 boards .
&quot; this sound@@ ed plates , shown above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I have not followed him home ) , dress the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he poss@@ esses such a considerable number of albums and singles , the result of his available income is now able to purchase plates that he could not afford to buy , when they appeared and again items to buy , which he sold , when he was young and pl@@ agues . &quot;
&quot; many things I bought , are from the late 60@@ s , early 70@@ s , which appeared , when I was 11 or 12 . things , in which I probably was something to buy it , he says . &quot;
&quot; he agre@@ es that those who are buying records , rather intro@@ ver@@ ized and like to spend their own time and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I drink no much . &quot;
this is my bl@@ aster .
&quot; AM@@ Z , 25 , who works at S@@ ister Ray , believes that many customers who meets the You@@ Go@@ v &apos;s Profile . &quot;
&quot; he has also noticed a new wave of people that will have influenced by the media , people who have heard about com@@ eback and see themselves again to buy their old records again . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations that I have led , people usually have been initiated by 1998 or in 1999 of their collection . &quot;
&quot; customers who have sold their boards to buy CDs now , buy their CDs , in order to buy their records again , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the B@@ oom to followers of the record @-@ revi@@ vals of a certain age .
but what about the attached emotional significance of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica to recognize that record is a so@@ othing community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers took their imp@@ etus to the contact @-@ free payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world , and would like to withdraw to the stability of trusted sound plate , from objects , the happy ju@@ gen@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it may be the filling of a void or the possession of material pos@@ sessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot;
that &apos;s like a coll@@ ector so I think it is with many people so .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; we are like their social worker ! &quot; fl@@ ush@@ ed an employee of a record @-@ stack .
&quot; a survey of the IC@@ M in April was revealed that almost 50 % of the people , the last month has bought a record , they have not yet heard . &quot;
&quot; the survey also found out that 41 % have a record player that they never use , while 7 % of those who have a record , no turn@@ table . &quot;
&quot; at this time of the news report , I probably would most likely look very concerned while I con@@ cis@@ ed through a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova Kom@@ pil@@ ots . &quot;
&quot; J@@ onny , 42 , the sounds of the sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men aged man ) , has an &quot; &quot; tro@@ phy &quot; &quot; of Re@@ vi@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; someone had only recently been here pure and said , &quot; &quot; I have no record player , but I would like to buy a radi@@ oh@@ ead sound@@ ed , so that I can put them into the shelf , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a large percentage , but it is definitely going to happen . &quot;
&quot; more articles , less musi@@ cl@@ as@@ y . &quot;
&quot; we have people who say , &quot; I have no turn@@ table . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older ones who only come slowly . &quot;
F@@ op@@ p that has devoted to the record almost a whole floor has a b@@ lower audience than I deer .
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make pictures , teen@@ agers and women middle age . &quot;
&quot; even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the pre @-@ standing shops , - Wild Be@@ asts &quot; &quot; Syn@@ thesi@@ zer@@ - and W@@ inn@@ ed Pop instead of experim@@ ental Jazz is acc@@ ust@@ omed from the lou@@ d@@ speakers - it is good to see such di@@ vers@@ ity with the customer . &quot;
&quot; none of them looks sunny , lon@@ ely lon@@ ely , but nag@@ ging psychological trau@@ mas are hard to determine if one stands next to someone for 30 seconds . &quot;
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs on the store for several minutes and views the variation of the sale of the sale . &quot;
it rather makes a bucket of sco@@ ut than a big one .
&quot; it doesn &apos;t deserve much , therefore the collecting of plates is not a real option , it says . &quot;
it is much .
&quot; it is easy to listen to music from a computer or another way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; she is driving with a loving swing . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it is really unique .
&quot; my last stop is a business , which is said that a new generation of turn@@ lovers is to have inspired : urban out@@ fit@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; while I give the credit , the je@@ ans @-@ hot@@ ties , watching a group of young teen@@ ager , which will be group@@ ed for a moment to buy Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and daughter to buy a cros@@ ley turn@@ table . &quot;
&quot; on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential records for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; nobody can see themselves - maybe because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to use them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; record . &quot;
&quot; but considering that every attraction for these items mean more money for the industry , and some customers could send to the dep@@ ths of Soh@@ os for more , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; there is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , also the one that is most common for luxury areas such as plates . &quot;
&quot; even if my post @-@ studies have agreed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v &apos;s vote , let them , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the large number of female bands and record lovers , who exist in reality , down@@ s and in online @-@ for@@ en , un@@ considered . &quot;
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday tomorrow with safety not with the Bum@@ ble by turn@@ tables of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates , while they provo@@ ke the rigi@@ d view of an un@@ fur@@ ious , 30 @-@ year @-@ old moder@@ ator , who over@@ sight nothing about the shoul@@ ders of the middle ages . &quot;

French Court st@@ aged from A@@ br@@ iss of shops in the jungle of refu@@ gee camps from
&quot; a French court has rejected a quote from the authorities in Cal@@ ais , do@@ z@@ ens of pro@@ visional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; during a court proceedings this week argu@@ ed the authorities in Cal@@ ais that the state should be authorized to sell 72 pro@@ visional stores , selling cigar@@ ettes , or tea for 50 cents ( 40 P@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in pro@@ visional restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argu@@ ed that these places would be de@@ generated , because they would pose a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid , and that a fire@@ works and plumbing risk . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups shared the court with that the business and restaurants are important as the free meals that would be offered by the state supported union and other groups , not enough food for growing numbers in stock . &quot;
they also led that the pro@@ visional stores and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the bank transfer of people who operate the 72 pro@@ visional stores , but sp@@ atial that the f@@ ecture of pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais are absolutely understand@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that the grocery stores , cafes and restaurants have a much bigger role to play as a people living in extremely prec@@ ari@@ ous conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas of quiet meeting between refugees and volunteers have to offer .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by defe@@ ats , the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos;@@ Café of the camp that is engaged in non @-@ smoking and French meals a day , English and French classes as well as guidance for asylum seek@@ ers , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed the peti@@ tion to keep the kids &apos; café . &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement trailer
&quot; Germany &apos;s ras@@ er must adapt to the next generation of speed measurements : in different federal states , among other things in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices will be tested especially effectively . &quot;
&quot; the fut@@ uris@@ tic En@@ forcement trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example to un@@ fail@@ ures , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on the motorway building or to san@@ itation bridges with temporary residence , there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide there with a stationary bub@@ bles to ensure the speed @-@ speed limit . &quot;
a permanent mobile structure can be too dangerous or time @-@ consuming .
&quot; the En@@ forcement trailer is aut@@ ark : his cor@@ d@@ less is holding at un@@ signed measuring operation five days , the case data is encryp@@ ted over a mo@@ dem . &quot;
&quot; with laser metro@@ logy , all vehicles can also be recorded at the same time . &quot;
&quot; variable speed , as well as transit to time , driving and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in a high @-@ up state , you can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with each car with a trailer . &quot;
&quot; so that he is not just cl@@ oned , he is lo@@ wer@@ ed in the measuring operation , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and inci@@ dentally also disappear . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system is to protect the bl@@ it@@ zer from V@@ and@@ alism . &quot;

great Britain gets silver in the 7 @-@ er Rugby after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold dated
&quot; the impressive performance of Great Britain at 7 @-@ er Rugby came to a fin@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were be@@ aten with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ odoro stage here in Rio . &quot;
&quot; Fi@@ ji acts a master@@ class in handling , Side @-@ St@@ epp@@ ing , return , lin@@ eup and ro@@ her power to win gold - their first Olympi@@ am@@ ed@@ al of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was promised by the not too bad tro@@ phy of the silver med@@ al - Britain &apos;s fourth to this day - and they were able to be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which she sm@@ ote New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the distinct defeat of the bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back on them in the final . &quot;
&quot; but independently of this , Fi@@ ji would have be@@ aten a 15 @-@ man team in order form . &quot;
&quot; it could be a comfort for GB - but it &apos;s probably not - that at least a Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold med@@ al for his neck , Fi@@ j@@ is Chief trainer Ben Ry@@ an , the former chief manager for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind itself .
eight years ago she lost in Ry@@ an every game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
&quot; here , they lost only one . &quot;
&quot; this cap is we@@ aving , but the progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji began wonderful and left the GB@@ s from fun inter@@ pr@@ all .
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell to and Co . , as if one would run into bicy@@ cling buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 to the top , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with another four minutes playing time , Jerry Tu@@ w@@ ai added another attack from the right corner , he turned out . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely has the ball rolling .
a well @-@ called T@@ ackle T@@ ackle von Mitchell st@@ opping the mountain of man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third gate to achieve but it has only Fi@@ ji only .
in the seventh minute le@@ te J@@ asa Ver@@ painting in the right corner a touch down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa was added a new since the play@@ back and there were still over a minute time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ enters through further weak sl@@ ackl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ my up to the line to make a gate .
the transformation brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
&quot; it is so , as if Fi@@ ji was born to play 7 , while GB still was d@@ az@@ ul@@ ed . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; GB led fundamental changes to the semi @-@ time and closed the fi@@ j@@ ian@@ ic gap ... for all four minutes , what was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua went through to a brilliant clip@@ play of Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner of a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game has been going on for long in favor of South Sudan , his fans s@@ angen and d@@ ges and d@@ anced on the tri@@ b@@ une . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the play@@ ful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a Vi@@ li@@ ame set the i @-@ icing with a further attempt in the last seconds .
&quot; the p@@ fi@@ ff pastry , the Fi@@ j@@ is h@@ ugs and GB k@@ ick@@ ed cr@@ ying in the law@@ ns . &quot;
&quot; earlier on the day Fi@@ ji Japan had defe@@ ated Fi@@ ji Japan in the semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 , South Africa in a scar@@ ce semi @-@ final match from the race - Great Britain conversion of the difference . &quot;
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ cs in the first half to the front , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke out the line with an impressive floor work and achieved a goal among the post in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late T@@ ackl@@ ing by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , attended the profit - and thus the silver med@@ al . &quot;
Hel@@ en G@@ lover and He@@ ather p@@ anning through battle with the cancer of the trainer for rowing machine
there will be no em@@ ot@@ intimate gold than these games and that wants to hot .
&quot; from the first ru@@ b to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve that go into history , Hel@@ en G@@ lover and He@@ ather p@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even though it was only the subsi@@ dy , who had three voices in the boat , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the Train@@ ers Robin Williams , was all@@ ot@@ ed as she became the second Olympi@@ ast@@ old in the second without tax @-@ woman in a result , the first women in the history of British sport that laid on such a scale . &quot;
&quot; your domin@@ ance was absolute , after all , your 39.@@ ched un@@ used use , which is also un@@ preced@@ ented . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant athletes , which gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sp@@ ong@@ es , which is not reflected in the type of tri@@ umph@@ s . &quot;
&quot; behind each gold in the Ru@@ dern , a batt@@ ali@@ on is a batt@@ ali@@ on to willing to make the difference and it was no more common than the coach that would not survive until 30 months ago if he was diagnosed this day at all . &quot;
as he said he is ris@@ ky .
&quot; I had Blas@@ enk@@ re@@ bs , the oper@@ able and that did it . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do that , he spread everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a pretty sh@@ lim@@ ous situation .
it changes a little the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio had fortunately that he was the treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , could start what the inter@@ ruption took to a minimum , in case that under such circumstances is the correct term . &quot;
I needed money so I had to go better again soon .
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was at the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough . &quot;
this is how it begins .
&quot; the ren@@ dering of itself is already a challenge , but it makes it a bigger one . &quot;
&quot; in the im@@ min@@ e@@ ability of victory , their first thought went to Williams , who spent a ner@@ ve @-@ lasting morning to talk a little more than usual , and so trying to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; st@@ anning , which was as captain in the Royal Arti@@ ll@@ ery Reg@@ im@@ ent in an application in Afghanistan , &quot; &quot; I was this week a emotional wre@@ ck . this is perhaps something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it is repeated only , how much I mean , how much I and helm@@ ets have worked and also Robin . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with helm@@ ets and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we would not be a massive thanks to him . he is the best coach of the world . &quot;
I could not have a better person to instruc@@ t or want a better coach .
Helena G@@ lover and He@@ ather p@@ anning have no race lost over the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents were unable to keep up with .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , as the teams from New Zealand and Denmark had to asc@@ end up , St@@ anning and G@@ lover had a lot in reserve . &quot;
we were very tr@@ apped in the moment .
&quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important to not let themselves te@@ ar .
we had a good start and at the same time we were unable to make some great .
&quot; we wanted no fire@@ works today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race , which we did . &quot;
the couple will take a time for one year before making decisions about his future .
&quot; G@@ lover must appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV adventur@@ er Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she just want to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that my last race was .
that would have a lot of pressure means .
&quot; in London , it took some six months to grasp that I am a Olympi@@ asi@@ tism . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;

he was adopted at the age of 65 at the age of 65 .
&quot; drinking water network with headquarters in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of lati@@ brunn , supports approximately 15@@ 0000 cu@@ bic meters water and supplies 32 places and hamlet with approximately 5@@ 500 residents . &quot;
&quot; member communities are the municipalities of Kirch@@ lau@@ ter , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ der , E@@ bel@@ sbach and the city of B@@ aun@@ ty . &quot;
for more towns and villages there are water supply contracts .
&quot; the current chairman , lati@@ tu@@ ns bourgeoisie in Ger@@ tru@@ d St@@ ä@@ d ( F@@ W ) , remin@@ ded that Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller 1985 was appointed as a water@@ way and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ tie &apos;s association . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they stretched out from the water @-@ assessment and maintenance work on office and organis@@ ational activities , the household planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency prepar@@ es in weekends , &quot; said the president . &quot;
&quot; as outstanding events , she called the commission@@ ing and inaugur@@ ation of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , property purchases in the field of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the re@@ creation of a central computer control ( 2004 ) , the re @-@ creation of a central computer control ( 2004 ) , and the pon@@ ds of water pipes . &quot;

&quot; he has worked with a lot of heart membran@@ e for its water @-@ purpose and he has lived the water @-@ bearing Federation , as if it would be his own company . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , he used to present themselves as a real practition@@ er to the success of the vote group to nit@@ rates ahead of the water forum of the district Unter@@ fran@@ ken . &quot;
&quot; for this , he has received a lot of praise and praise . &quot;
Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller s@@ lau@@ gh Al@@ f@@ ons gri@@ ebel who worked with him 28 years with him .
he is the best water bar and he was a faithful button .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as high points from its point of view , he referred to the Brun@@ n@@ ist and the restructuring of the twelve . &quot;
but the greatest challenge and the most difficult utili@@ zation were the tube age at Kirch@@ lau@@ er on one 3rd January .
&quot; here we had to go through minus 17 degrees all night through , so that the plac@@ ements could be supplied with water . &quot;
&quot; also the supply of Neu@@ brunn , one can only maintain it once , because you filled the high @-@ container of P@@ ett@@ stadt with slots . &quot;
the management of drinking water @-@ purpose was handed over to Daniel St@@ ür@@ mer from Lau@@ der who enters the follow @-@ up of Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller .

steel - Light@@ ing for German steel industry
the cold @-@ exploited and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains un@@ covered by additional costs in milli@@ on@@ ward height .
&quot; financial loads , which threat@@ ens the industry from the Ö@@ kost@@ rom @-@ promoting , are from the table . &quot;
&quot; it will stay in the liberation of renewable energy sources in the German steel industry , said the Federal Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( W@@ AZ , Frei@@ tag@@ on ) . &quot;
I &apos;m really happy that after two years we could finally arrive in the negotiations after two years .
&quot; the European Commission had planned initially planned , the steel producer , the g@@ ases from the stool to generate electricity generation for their own consumption , to go to the c@@ ass . &quot;
&quot; the steel industry is at additional cost from 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot;
Gabriel said the W@@ AZ , now I will now give an agreement with the European Commission to talks with competitive com@@ pris@@ ed Mar@@ gre@@ the Vest@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when the generators in the steel works are replaced , f@@ alle an E@@ EG conversion of 20 percent . &quot;
but this will not be raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the agreement of Germany with the EU Commission for equity production .
&quot; thus , the status quo of the previous regulation will be largely fixed . &quot;
particular importance have the successful effort of Gabriel for steel industry .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; Steel is future &apos; , this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; others need to follow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; even in the reform of the emis@@ sion of emis@@ sion , climate and employment targets are predic@@ ted , &quot; explained IG Metall @-@ Chef Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from the financial crisis 2008 under excess capacity and a significant price .
&quot; over the past year , the situation further intensi@@ fied as the world &apos;s largest show in China due to the weak@@ est domestic demand mass@@ enh@@ aft steel into the world market . &quot;
European manufacturers raise Chinese steel concerts @-@ dump@@ ing .
in the course of this early stages the situation has a little relaxed .
&quot; to indicate a show , inser@@ tion effect on Im@@ port@@ ing effect , to the other have the economic prospects in China . &quot;
it is un@@ clear how sustainable the discounts is up .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp remained carefully on Thursday .
&quot; last , the prices would have been more likely to be stag@@ nat@@ ing . &quot;
the industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost below .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp wanted not to be able to include certain works at least .
&quot; in the German steel industry , there were some 86@@ ,000 people at the end of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in July , German steel makers remain careful in spite of rising prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; they produced more than 3.4 million tons of fewer raw materials than in the pre @-@ year @-@ year @-@ month , as the economic union of steel on Friday . &quot;
after a short increase in May the set quantity went back to each other .
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production is reduced by two percent below the previous year . &quot;
the association counting in the coming months thanks to improved order intake with a rising output .
&quot; community , Spirit , Health : sing Sen@@ iors good &quot;
&quot; the S@@ ingen has accompanied ur@@ sel K@@ ip@@ p already accompanied her whole life : as a young girl , she was in the school &apos;s choir , in teaching studies , and today s@@ ings the 78 @-@ year @-@ old in a seniors choir . &quot;
&quot; singing me - emotional and physically , &quot; describes it . &quot;
&quot; after a sample she feels balanced , cheer@@ ful and a total of living , she says . &quot;
&quot; throughout the next door , she is doing something good for her health and her mind . &quot;
&quot; for S@@ ingen is the same from several perspectives a great hobby for seniors , says Er@@ hard H@@ ackl@@ er from the Deutsche Sen@@ iors liga . &quot;
&quot; most seniors sing in choir and share with like @-@ minded the joy of music , describes it . &quot;
&quot; by regular cohesion , seniors can establish social contacts and maintain . &quot;
&quot; for frequently , social and family structures take place at the age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience also has made Ur@@ sel K@@ ip@@ p in her choir : &quot; to speak and organize themselves to the others , and learn from one another - a choir is a very special form of awareness . &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , says H@@ ackl@@ er . &quot;
they are practic@@ ing a deep and controlled breathing .
who regularly calls his lungs as well as in everyday life not as fast from the pu@@ ties .
&quot; even though it is about to preserve the sound of the voice in the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; in older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz of the Federal employment community of the Sen@@ iors organizations . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations the common S@@ ingen had a much higher priority , it belong@@ ed to everyday life , both at school and in leisure , explains her . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz observed frequently that singing or hearing of songs with older people have awak@@ ened lots of memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
&quot; thanks to Li@@ ed@@ tex@@ te and especially mel@@ o@@ dies , even frag@@ ile people in the long past events . &quot;
&quot; at S@@ ingen , the head will also require a special performance , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
at the same time focusing on their own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - that is a great cogni@@ tive challenge .
&quot; older people who live alone , practice so , not only on itself . &quot;
another positive aspect is recognition that one moves through the singing in the chor@@ us says H@@ ackl@@ er .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
also the self @-@ esteem grows due to the singing in chor@@ us .
&quot; to show themselves , if I go for something for something , I will be better and watch@@ ful beyond me - this experience will strengthen . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to begin with the singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he means a little talent , betra@@ ying L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; you do not s@@ ings alone - at 50 Sing@@ ing people , who listen to who is there a sound next to it ? &quot;
&quot; in search of the appropriate offer , seniors have different ways , says H@@ ackl@@ er . &quot;
singing someone out of the friend in a seniors &apos;s choir , you can simply join . &quot;
many cities also offer views of the cho@@ irs in the area .
&quot; who would like to sing in a church choir , can turn directly to the church or the church of church . &quot;
many sen@@ ior@@ ench@@ yma can also be found on the Internet .
&quot; who does not have access to the internet , the family , friends or neighbors can ask for help with the Internet . &quot;
&quot; who desire to sing , should necessarily join a choir , betra@@ ying it . &quot;
singing the soul doing well and has something liber@@ ating - this applies to any age .
Cats do more sensitive than K@@ ater on Schrei@@ e of the young animals
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover and what effect the ru@@ ps of cat@@ en@@ bab@@ ys on adult animals have .
&quot; to their surprise , the male also did not let the males do not cold - however , they kept in contrast to the females always the same . &quot;
female cats can recognize the excit@@ ability of cat@@ en@@ bab@@ ys at the ren@@ ch@@ ing of the sounds .
&quot; they are responding to ten percent faster in b@@ ittens from k@@ ittens , as well as scientists from the veterinary University and the Medical School Hannover ( M@@ HH ) . &quot;
&quot; k@@ ater will also react to the ru@@ in of k@@ ittens , but always the same . &quot;
&quot; evi@@ d@@ ently , the aco@@ us@@ tical differences between the hir@@ ing of less and strong inher@@ ited gen@@ ces for the males are either not per@@ cep@@ tible or not of meaning , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding said by the M@@ HH . &quot;
&quot; it is first author@@ it@@ ary in the study , which was published on this Friday at the &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a previous study , the research team had already found that the duration and height of the k@@ ittens @-@ typ@@ ing is distinguished with the ur@@ gency of their emergency . &quot;
&quot; observed by a total of nine adult , and eight atro@@ cities from the animal welfare of the M@@ HH . &quot;
&quot; they were played for a herd of cl@@ one , which were taken for three minutes from the worm box and separated by mother and si@@ bl@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; to the other , they were confronted with scre@@ aming of stronger k@@ ittens , which were in addition highly superior . &quot;
the researchers keep their results despite the low sample rehear@@ sal for meaningful .
&quot; all females , even those who had not yet had their own offspring , re@@ acted differ@@ ed on the Schrei@@ e , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
they will be faster to the lou@@ d@@ speaker if this ru@@ ps of the very ra@@ iny k@@ ittens played .
this ability may be grown or develop with the lov@@ emaking .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already examined many times when people investig@@ ates the reactions of women and men to baby . &quot;
&quot; also some studies showed that women are more sensitive to inf@@ ants , regardless of whether they were already m@@ others or not , reported the Bi@@ olog@@ in Marina Bar@@ um@@ ann . &quot;
po@@ dol@@ ski g@@ att@@ ed with &quot; Gal@@ a &quot; by Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ l@@ r is in Turkey a soccer leg@@ end .
in Turkey against the one @-@ set soccer star Hak@@ an Sü@@ l@@ r had been er@@ ected .
he will be disc@@ ard@@ ed to be a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup , a major football game takes place in Turkey . &quot;
in front of the Du@@ ell of the Arch@@ ri@@ val between settlements and Luke Po@@ dol@@ sk@@ is Gal@@ van@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya is the official line clearly : &quot; business as &quot; is said .
&quot; even in the case of the acceptance period after the overthrow in July , the government , the everyday life of norm@@ alities should not be affected . &quot;
&quot; but this does not apply to those who susp@@ ects the ser@@ mon Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup . &quot;
this also does not stop in front of football .
against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ l@@ r asked the pro@@ secution for a rest warran@@ t .
&quot; according to the meantime , the south of America living in the Americas , a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ l@@ r should be the p@@ endant of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an for the coup . &quot;
&quot; although this applies initially for 90 days of extended period still until October , actually it has on the life of most Tur@@ ks but as good as no effect . &quot;
the nour@@ ish &quot; democracy gu@@ ards &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared Erd@@ og@@ an on Wednesday for finished .
sport is - like the whole land - split in supporters and opponents of Erd@@ og@@ an .
especially fans of the workers &apos; clubs defeat were traditionally not among the friends of the President .
&quot; what the gro@@ s of the Tur@@ ks but in view dramatic experiences in history , the strict rejection of military put@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; even the fans are even the fans , whether their heart is defe@@ ated for Gal@@ van@@ ar@@ ay or defeat . &quot;
at Pok@@ al@@ winner &quot; Gal@@ a &quot; will be getting back on Luke po@@ dol@@ ski .
its sporting value presented the Köl@@ ner in the exp@@ ired season : with 17 gates and nine Templates in all competitions ended the 31 @-@ year @-@ old his first Play@@ time as a Top@@ scor@@ er of his association .
in the end@@ game against F@@ ener@@ sc@@ ce he scor@@ ed the 1 : 0 @-@ Treffer .
the newspaper &quot; FAN@@ AT@@ IK &quot; was celeb@@ ed him : &quot; he was the best in the square . &quot;
he completed the season in excellent way and secured his team the Pok@@ al team .
&quot; thanks &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; found the dis@@ appoint@@ ing season for the record . &quot;
&quot; after the pre @-@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; &quot; li@@ ons &quot; &quot; also distinguished in the Europe League early . &quot;
in the sweet@@ ener it is only to rank six .
the season was not good .
the Pok@@ al was the only way to win something .
&quot; that we managed and this is the most important , &quot; said po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
for Master settlements the game ran better .
&quot; above all thanks to Mario G@@ ome@@ z , who made with 26 Sa@@ is@@ ont@@ re@@ eds as an Sü@@ ver @-@ li@@ ff @-@ tor@@ tie , based on the 14th title . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans will continue to return to the return of 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; in doing so , the AC Florence on the treaty was passed on to the Put@@ t G@@ ome@@ z , according to the coup G@@ ome@@ z , because of the political situation in the country after its EM @-@ holiday . &quot;
&quot; if Mario still wants to come to us , he must only say , &quot; c@@ ited the magazine &quot; &quot; K@@ icker &quot; Club@@ chief F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; however , the stor@@ ms need to be ready to disp@@ ose around one third of its to 7.5 million Euros , Or@@ man presented clear : &quot; &quot; his sal@@ ary in Florence we cannot pay . &quot;
despite Dop@@ ing : these athletes still have medals opportunities at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin has been closed twice because of Dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lo@@ wer@@ in Julia step@@ an@@ owa may not start in Rio
others exag@@ ger@@ ated athle@@ tics @-@ sinn@@ ers can only lau@@ gh it - they fight in Rio to medals .
the subject of Dop@@ ing determines how the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio .
&quot; the Russian swimm@@ ers in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , who was initiated after a dop@@ ing @-@ lock her start right before the games , was de@@ fi@@ red at their start ( 100 meters chest ) of gn@@ om@@ y and abandoned . &quot;
it offered a sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile scene : with a put smile they were still in the hall and had prov@@ oked with her appearance .
&quot; when noted , they won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke into a j@@ ub@@ el@@ storm . &quot;
but there are many more sports@@ men who in spite of a dop@@ ing past at the Olympic Games in Rio at the beginning .
here is an overview :
&quot; J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Seas@@ on / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the contro@@ versi@@ al figures in the athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was closed two times due to dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
&quot; since his spell , the Olympi@@ asi@@ eger from 2004 and Ex @-@ World Champion is even faster than before , it is over 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world , and is considered as the biggest editor of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t . &quot;
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ y@@ ce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / Jam@@ a@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympi@@ asi@@ ons and seven @-@ fold World Championship had to sit down after the intake of pain using Oxy@@ co@@ don . &quot;
they had severe dental aches after a surgery , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
Sandra Per@@ ko@@ vic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : 2011 was tested the Olympi@@ asi@@ eg@@ ress of 2012 , World Championship of 2013 and European Championship in 2010 to 2016 positive in the stimul@@ ant stimul@@ ant means meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin . &quot;
Per@@ ko@@ vic pun@@ ches the wis@@ ed intake and has been closed for six months .
the four consec@@ rated thro@@ ws this year go to the account of the great gold fav@@ ori@@ tin .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing @-@ Olympi@@ asi@@ eger and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , 2010 was positive tested and 21 months was locked . &quot;
a means of penis enlargement may have been responsible .
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old over 200 and 400 m is the fastest man in the world .
&quot; Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ ing , Belarus ) : probably hardly any athle@@ te were noticeable so many medals . &quot;
&quot; so lost T@@ ich@@ on his World Cup title of 2005 nine years later , after with him testosterone dop@@ ing was established . &quot;
the meantime 40 @-@ year @-@ olds had to leave Olympia @-@ Silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the EM @-@ title 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
&quot; the Bronze med@@ al of the Olympic Games in 2008 , he received prior to a certificate of the International Pra@@ yer &apos;s CAS . &quot;
&quot; with 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m , it is located on the rank two of the world list . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km to walk , China ) : the Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord@@ ant and Gold@@ fav@@ ory has only been positive in May in May , but still in Rio . &quot;
&quot; at the 29 years old world Championships were found on the intake of a dimin@@ ished supplements , the lock of the World @-@ Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency W@@ ada fell off and ran already on 13 July . &quot;
bom@@ b in Thailand - Öster@@ reich@@ erin wo@@ unded - Multi@@ power T@@ ote
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stand with the woman in contact , said the spok@@ es@@ man of the State Department , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Frei@@ day@@ early . &quot;
&quot; they have suffered cutting and had been treated in hospital in hospital , but I have already left it again . &quot;
your home travel will be planned for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether from the other explo@@ sions on Holi@@ day@@ island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ arb@@ on also are Austrian citi@@ zenship , be still un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of State stand in continuous contact with the local authorities , so Schn@@ ö@@ ll . &quot;
&quot; at about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in were first explo@@ ded on Thursday night in a out@@ lined two bom@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; according to police have been killed in Thailand , and some 20 people have been viol@@ ated , including the Austrian , three Germans , three ra@@ ils and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; in early days , two Spr@@ ints went up again , with the authorities another man was killed . &quot;
also by Ph@@ u@@ ket was reported in the morning a bom@@ bs of bom@@ bs .
at the det@@ on@@ ation near the holiday popular Bad@@ est@@ r@@ ands Pat@@ ong was inj@@ ured by police information a taxi driver .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the southeast coast of the country also explo@@ ded another bom@@ b that k@@ ills an urban grounds .
the spr@@ inkl@@ er set out according to the authorities in a flo@@ wering in front of the four of the coastal polar police in the air .
&quot; finally , the det@@ on@@ ations called in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast , as well as in Ch@@ oh@@ on on the south @-@ east coast . &quot;
&quot; you go from a connection to the blast in Hu@@ a H@@ in , called it . &quot;
&quot; the Bom@@ ben@@ att@@ un@@ ate carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; &quot; said Ar@@ me@@ eg@@ ener@@ al Dan@@ ai : meth@@ av@@ ee open @-@ day early to journalists . &quot;
we assume that it is a coordinated attack .
&quot; it may be too early to outer on possible moti@@ ves , but probably it is about the deeds of Muslim reb@@ els . &quot;
also Thai media wanted to recognize a pattern which is typical for the bom@@ b@@ att@@ ate mus@@ li@@ man separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; in contrast , Thai police declared , the attacks in connection with the Islam@@ ist movement or international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is limited to local sab@@ ot@@ age that limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a speaker in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; rather , it is rather that the bom@@ bs of opponents of the ruling military j@@ un@@ ta were laid . &quot;
&quot; in the past few days , the authorities would have received more sec@@ utions on upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but don &apos;t have been informed about the exact time and the places . &quot;
&quot; still be un@@ clear , which group behind the attacks . &quot;
&quot; the police dism@@ is@@ sed their officials in the whole country , the security around important governmental buildings as well as airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and am@@ us@@ ement parks . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand there are always smaller bom@@ b attacks , but they usually set up against tourists . &quot;
Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace built over the years of Thailand &apos;s King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol AD@@ UL@@ Y@@ A@@ DE@@ J .
&quot; according to the ancient Bom@@ ben@@ ds , the Austrian Foreign Ministry is called for its homepage to provide the instructions of the Thai security authorities . &quot;
&quot; high safety risk ( security stage 3 ) bor@@ ed for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ iw@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Song@@ h@@ kl@@ a and Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings . &quot;
&quot; following conflicts between security and mus@@ lim@@ bic populations , no necessary travel will occur in this provinces . &quot;
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) suffered for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took a few days after a contro@@ versi@@ al referendum on one of the military j@@ un@@ ta .
this sp@@ atial rate of military influence also in the coming years .
&quot; Jun@@ ta chef and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ CH@@ A said , the bom@@ bs have been an attempt to sti@@ p@@ ens chaos during the country towards stability , an improvement of economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta , who had taken power after a phase of blo@@ ody un@@ rest , himself keeps themselves good to have the kingdom again to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military did not have managed to get a grip on the outer south for years in the outer south of the country . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
a year ago in Bangkok was also killed in Bangkok in a popular Hind@@ u shock for 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the blo@@ ody attack of the younger history of the country .
the right &quot; identity movement &quot; is into the Vis@@ or of the Bundes@@ am@@ tes for constitutional protection .
&quot; according to several nation@@ als , the Constitu@@ tional Treaty also have placed the Group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see the &quot; &quot; identification movement &quot; &quot; point for aspir@@ ations against the liber@@ ative democratic fundamental order , &quot; said Ver@@ sion@@ ist chief Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , the refu@@ ge of Islamic faith or the Middle East are diff@@ am@@ eful in extreme way . &quot;
that is why we also observe the movement now .
the &quot; identification movement &quot; is an group@@ ing with French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 .
&quot; it turns against &quot; mul@@ tig@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controll@@ able mass immigration &quot; and the &quot; loss of its own identity by alien@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; constitutional referendum in nine Länder - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NR@@ W , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ ing@@ ia - watch the &quot; &quot; identity &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ate said , his authority has been closely align@@ ed with the country &apos;s decision . &quot;
&quot; groups such as the &apos; identity movement &apos; try to pick up their target group , where it stands , &quot; &quot; said the constitutional director . &quot;
&quot; generally , extrem@@ ists are trying to address them with a youth@@ ful language , often with p@@ opp@@ ose music . &quot;
the activities Islam@@ ists as well as legal extrem@@ ists .
this is not a real advertising for your own thing .
the propaganda should talk to people emoti@@ onally .
young people are so pr@@ one in a special way .
this is dangerous .
&quot; recently , there had been reports of contacts with the &quot; &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; &quot; reports on contacts of the &quot; &quot; identification &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , he did not have knowledge . &quot;
&quot; for the constitutional , possible contacts this type will only be relevant from a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals , the extre@@ mism , changes and so extrem@@ ist will change . &quot;
&quot; therefore , whether such persons are the targeted influence on the party . &quot;
this is not recogni@@ z@@ able .
&quot; with a view of the marked increase of illegal criminal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refu@@ gee camps , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak of new rights in this context . &quot;
but we have noticed that there can be right@@ eous structures in recent years .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Free group .
&quot; it may well be that more illegal group@@ ings or small groups formed , the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refu@@ gee centres or attacks from other legal moti@@ fs are planning . &quot;
but a pay@@ roll or Europe @-@ wide control of law@@ r@@ ror@@ ism is not recogni@@ z@@ able .
the previous groups were taken on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; moreover , Ma@@ ate above that many transi@@ tions entered into the account of people who were not occur@@ ring in the right scene in the right scene . &quot;
this is the wor@@ rying .
&quot; many of the opinion on attacks on asylum seek@@ ers may not be known as cri@@ minals , politically motivated criminal off@@ ences or supporters of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; many people have committed criminal off@@ ences , who had previously been politically in@@ different , who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or for example CD@@ U , SPD or left , who then have radic@@ alised , however , are radic@@ alised . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes the Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always determine the Olympi@@ ans or world cor@@ ds at the Olympic Games .
this shows the bra@@ ve performance of RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer playing in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; at the Aqu@@ atics Center spon@@ ge , the slightly overweight swimm@@ ers from Ethiopia is so slow that he did not see any more in the TV pictures . &quot;
he disappeared and easy - no matter how far the cut out was selected .
in social networks Hab@@ te became the vi@@ ral Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old with a return of 48 seconds ended up and animated the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; however , it was rather his not just spor@@ ty figure who drew attention to the attention of international media . &quot;
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates at the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ians got a special start by the international swimming association .
this will be distributed to make swimming in under@@ estimated countries .
&quot; as in ether , most athletes run , Hab@@ te simply wanted to do something else . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first pointed names took the lap .
some media signed it as &quot; RO@@ BEL of the W@@ al . &quot;
&quot; based on a &quot; &quot; prosperity &quot; &quot; made the English Bou@@ lev@@ ard@@ blatt &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; D@@ ad Bo@@ d &quot; &quot; about him funny . &quot;
&quot; his time , he was struck only with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter style , there was no matter . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the e@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney run the run of Eric Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i for medi@@ ale attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Ä@@ qu@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete in a pre @-@ run over 100 meter style . &quot;
fr@@ en@@ e@@ tically became Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i back then .
&quot; at that time 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned only eight months before Olympia , and had never been completed before the competition for a long distance . &quot;

&quot; should it be nothing to choose for the U.S. president , Donald Tru@@ mp has already an alternative . &quot;

&quot; if it is not rich for him at the end of the sake of political correctness , be the right , said Tru@@ mp . &quot;

within his party more and more resistance .

accidents - bus ru@@ tsch@@ t in Kru@@ mm@@ rel in Gr@@ aben : eight For@@ rest
&quot; during an accident of a travel chat with 43 seniors as passengers , on Thursday in Kru@@ mm@@ audi@@ n ( Land@@ circle Aur@@ ich ) had been viol@@ ated eight people . &quot;
&quot; two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injury , divided the police with . &quot;
&quot; the 66 years old driving of a travel company from Eisen@@ nach had to differ according to their statements , according to the opposite le@@ aster , the partly was driving . &quot;
the bus came to the right from the road and slip into a dit@@ ch as a speaker in the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund was reported .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , the people could not rely on the bus &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire shared the in@@ mates .
six lif@@ egu@@ ards and a not@@ ary days came to the accident on the Landes@@ str . 2 .
the most recent travellers were brought back from a Lin@@ i@@ enb@@ us back to the Kru@@ mm@@ audi@@ ner District P@@ ew@@ sum .
&quot; there , they should wait for a spare @-@ bus from the travel business . &quot;
the investig@@ ator demanded the load @-@ experienced and possible witnesses to sign up in the police .
&quot; fees per hect@@ or@@ meter wast@@ ew@@ ater will amount from 1 October 2016 for the area of the re@@ hydr@@ ation of Neu@@ dorf / re@@ uth / Wel@@ sh@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3,@@ 36 Euro ( until 2.@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( until 2.@@ 18 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the wast@@ ew@@ ater fee will be again later if appropriate improvement measures will be necessary . &quot;
&quot; after a higher level calculation , the wast@@ ew@@ ater will be in Az@@ endorf at 4,@@ 37 euros per cu@@ bic meters . &quot;
&quot; as Mayor of Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , was noted during the approval of the household due to the land of the land of Kul@@ mb@@ ach , that for these se@@ wage systems . &quot;
&quot; the Kas@@ endorf Market is committed to the legal basis based on legal principles , the plant @-@ covers . &quot;
&quot; from 1st October 2016 , citizens , as well as the ge@@ - and industrial transmission from Wel@@ sh@@ al , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg have to draw deeper into the money bag . &quot;
the blad@@ der increase lies between 48 and 67 percent .
such as administrative leader Herbert Schmidt on the panel was a res@@ kal@@ ulation of the fees necessary for waste water systems .
&quot; in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , Over@@ - or sub @-@ covers from the previous season will be equ@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; consequently , the engra@@ ving increase is based on all three se@@ wage systems by relatively small facilities with a very low waste water he@@ els , which is between 68@@ 00 and 1@@ 2000 cu@@ bic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; thus , due to the low distribution basis , for instance to affect the repar@@ ations of necessary repairs of several thousands of Euros . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the wast@@ ew@@ ater treatment in all three systems are slightly retro@@ active . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in the back@@ drop period due to all three systems , not least due to its alarm system and repairs in a significant extent . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ sh@@ al , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth and Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt pointed out that in the Az@@ endorf Az@@ endorf the mechanical ventilation system has to be ex@@ changed due to any damage .
&quot; in the pump@@ ing station which had to out@@ dated nearly 20 years old funding plants , and in the pond industry Lop@@ p had to be installed on after nearly 20 years of operation of the first cl@@ amps , the clari@@ fication of clari@@ fications and an additional insu@@ lt option to hold the water @-@ legal requirements in the future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; on these extraordinary expen@@ di@@ tures the pro@@ curement and maintenance costs , which are to be considered according to the new cal@@ ine period . &quot;
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which in the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 still significantly under the current level . &quot;
&quot; stone houses made clear that with the low waste water waste in the three facilities , the expenses for operation and maintenance . &quot;
&quot; in this process , suppl@@ emented Schmidt , the market community of big maintenance costs over the past 20 years have stayed for over the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the afor@@ ementioned facilities will continue to be prec@@ ari@@ zed on the duration of stone houses , especially when you are unable to expand the reserve area of the wast@@ ew@@ ater of Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al by these facilities , because it is dedicated to defic@@ its facilities . &quot;
Bulgaria exp@@ ires for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July 1 % was reduced to a monthly basis .
&quot; this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) , and the first over zero since October last year , as positive 0,2 % were destroyed . &quot;
the annual average of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0,8 % .
&quot; the Consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % . &quot;

Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; -@@ effect as asian car@@ ic@@ ature
&quot; Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say it is in@@ sensitive to bre@@ eds . &quot;
&quot; with its filter tool , there is Snap@@ chat about 150 million daily users who change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that the absur@@ d borders itself . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be made of a Ro@@ y Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are imm@@ ort@@ ed , autonom@@ ous tools , which generate more than 30 million improved ro@@ wers per day . &quot;
all fail@@ ing will get to the public .
Snap@@ chat filter have drawn up in the past criticism in which they were acc@@ used that the App Black@@ face @-@ dere or white skin as beauty @-@ deal prop@@ elled .
&quot; when this week some U@@ sers has proposed a filter that gave them sl@@ ud@@ ges , wrong teeth and re@@ conc@@ ile wo@@ unded , there were some critics a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; Gel@@ b@@ ade . &quot;
they asked whether these repeti@@ tive contro@@ vers@@ y was to a larger problem that the company has promised .
&quot; the news and the reception were widely used on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mot@@ her@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat , that it would have been disabled . &quot;
the company offered an exc@@ use : the filter was meant as hom@@ age to anim@@ e @-@ characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but aliens who have experienced rac@@ ism , remin@@ ded of the filter on inj@@ uries c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
others had decided against anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ apan@@ i , a Korean American art of art , whose twe@@ et have been widely spread over the photos that the filter was inj@@ ured , and was said unpleasant . &quot;
they added that &quot; it was difficult to ar@@ gue with the return to a very conflic@@ ting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not cur@@ ly assured , but that the nest is being pul@@ led to the down Extre@@ m . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural Stol@@ er .
American culture seems to be ent@@ angl@@ ed in an endless diversi@@ fication and integr@@ ation@@ sk@@ amp@@ f from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand .
and Snap@@ shot great audience young people - who are di@@ vers@@ ed in matters of race than their older counter@@ part - could be more likely to expect sensi@@ bilities .
&quot; when one of the Snap@@ shot filters is created an image that for a user memory is , &quot; so it &apos;s much harder that such things was un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as a product management and engineer for medium , her Snap@@ chat account , called for others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said that they believe that r@@ acial contro@@ vers@@ aries have a lack of diver@@ gence with the in@@ cis@@ ions in Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu cri@@ tici@@ zed the big part white , only male leadership and ended their essay with an has@@ ht@@ ag : # Del@@ ete@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no various representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors , who work there , but not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint , the Snap@@ chat was largely un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish numbers on diver@@ gence of its workforce and points to its status as private company .
&quot; on Thursday , there was Snap@@ chat to discuss the cultural back@@ grounds of his employees , but according to a consultation , the company has recently focused on a personnel responsible , which focused on sub@@ ordin@@ ated population groups and on internal integration of integration . &quot;
&quot; in turn , in turn , they let her Snap@@ chat account is closed , and added , &quot; I ask myself whether they need more users like us to say that that is not o.@@ k@@ . . &quot;
&quot; military management , IS@@ IS intelligence information , presents the Committee of Congress . &quot;
&quot; member of the United States Central Command change@@ able information to draw an optim@@ istic image of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as it had allowed the actual states of Congress in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the pro@@ visional report created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can members of the dispute settlement , intelligence service committee , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction under Central Command Intelligence analyses , which reported how they modified their ass@@ ess@@ ments to the American efforts in the fight against Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; the Central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military main qu@@ artier in Tamp@@ a , Florida who controls the American military battles in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; mess@@ aging information , which have been completed by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Kom@@ man@@ de@@ ors typically , a positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism , and were conducted by the actual states on site , and were conducted through analyses of other news services , &quot; presented a newspaper article . &quot;
&quot; what has happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analyses of our political leaders presented , &quot; &quot; Ken Cal@@ ver@@ t , Republi@@ can become a member of Repres@@ ent@@ atives . &quot;
the management of the Cent@@ Com range up to the top tip of the organization .
the ten @-@ sided report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in education of Ira@@ qi armed forces .
&quot; although there are no direct evidence that government tips given to change the reports , it shows how analy@@ sts are exposed to the pressure from their privil@@ eges , an optim@@ istic image of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half @-@ year 2015 many Central Command Pres@@ entation , opinions and statements in front of the Congress was clearly more positive than the facts presented to the facts . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com had publicly known that a military withdrawal of mos@@ sul@@ m has already begun in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ su@@ l , second largest city of Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigations , is so much clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress of K@@ ansas , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of the year 2015 , the points of Central Command Promp@@ t reports to watch the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ public@@ ans called the Task Force in life , after having been playing that analy@@ sts were worried about the manip@@ ulation of reports to the Islamic State . &quot;
the report published on Thursday will still be completed by more detailed findings during the investigation .
additional investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are under@@ way by the general spec@@ ter of the Defence Ministry of Defence .
democratic members of the mess@@ enger plann@@ ers published on Thursday their own findings that coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 the Cent@@ Com has created an over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of domestic @-@ ass@@ ess@@ ments to IS@@ IL and the Ira@@ qi security services , &quot; gave the most important democr@@ at of Repres@@ ent@@ atives Adam B. ship , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; this process , so Mr. Shi@@ ft , &quot; ref@@ used the publication of the news @-@ service reports , &quot; def@@ ects the mor@@ als under analy@@ sts and &quot; there were little space for different opinions . &quot;
&quot; but Mr. Shi@@ ft and Democrats gave no evidence on a stri@@ pe of the White House at Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , with regard to a &quot; certain political opinion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the meeting of Congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Beast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported by Er@@ mitt@@ enhof through the in@@ spect@@ ator of the Pent@@ agon , which were taken to complaints from Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a review of the Pent@@ agon , gave in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence were no reports of Congress , while the investigation of the general practition@@ er was still in progress . &quot;
&quot; but he also gave , that &quot; experts sometimes have quite diver@@ ting opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and defence of Defence , a contro@@ vers@@ y discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
issu@@ ing effects on the question of a successful a@@ ign of American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a statement that is now made by a growing number of members of the defence of Defence ) .
&quot; the acc@@ us@@ ations of the last year , however , have raised the question that President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest ass@@ ess@@ ments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism regarding the secret information on the Islamic State to remember the Islamic State , as a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , a writer above George W. Bush contrary to the recommendations of many analy@@ sts in Iraq and took some time on the consequences of the invasion of 2003 thoughts . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the u@@ prising against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team dedicated to Mr. Hoo@@ ker to indicate that the statements of the government of sur@@ charges against that of the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terr@@ ors , since these pro@@ visional refin@@ eries were unable to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this knowledge was not published , reported the Times in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ s then Bef@@ ehl@@ sh@@ aber , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was cri@@ tici@@ zed by members of the leg@@ is@@ ative assessment of its over@@ ly positive assessment of the warri@@ or during a hearing before the Sen@@ ate . &quot;
general Austin was reti@@ red in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
&quot; the US win four@@ teen match in the field of women , a show@@ down with the UK stands before &quot;
&quot; one day after they had shot three doors during an 6 @-@ 1 stra@@ ins via Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two doors for the American dirt team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americ@@ ans made with 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games should really represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said , she could not remember that ever did . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I did not belong to the people who keep their doors in memory .
&quot; the white , however , white them : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the olymp@@ ic competition and are equal in their group with the Britain on the first place , which remains un@@ be@@ aten to their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will take place on Saturday in the last game of the first lap .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ fin@@ als , the game will decide the first and second place within their group from six teams . &quot;
the first turn @-@ bur@@ nt will go some longer the way that the other group will perform .
&quot; as always the game may take out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vor@@ tex about four years after her last London Games on the last of 12 places . &quot;
B@@ AM was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania on , and had the first time with three years in the hands ( their two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became National Champion of the USA , the youn@@ gest in the history of the team . &quot;
&quot; she missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 , since they could not qualify for the K@@ ader . &quot;
then the year 2012 where she and her team went everything .
&quot; the next year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham became an English , coach of the national teams , and thus the things began to get better . &quot;
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the work race in London which we now have .
we have to get around the rest of the rest .
on Thursday morning B@@ am opened the Tor@@ ri@@ gen in the first half of the game with a backl@@ ash from the clos@@ eness .
&quot; India was gone without victory in the tournament in the game , but the team showed surprisingly crazy and held the game of 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , up to B@@ am the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; it carried a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and l@@ up@@ ted the ball into the gate to get to the Americ@@ ans a 2 @-@ 0 guidance . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ zal@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the door@@ ke@@ eper of the USA , Jackie Brig@@ gs , which so far had to cancel the gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
exactly like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; Par@@ n@@ ham , &quot; but how well will depend on Saturday the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; amongst the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , how late it is , there are the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro are confident and inevitable , a rapid deteri@@ oration between competition and aspir@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; it is , as if the Olympic F@@ ack@@ el itself would be a burning stand , which is made by the wr@@ ist to the swimm@@ ers to the Tur@@ ner to the Tri@@ ath@@ l@@ eten . &quot;
&quot; you can not switch to the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the queue in the queue , without using Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is still Log@@ an D@@ ool@@ ey .
&quot; D@@ ool@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s black with dim@@ ples , could well be sent under these known names which might be sent to Prime Time through sponsors and well @-@ being @-@ TV advertising , if he would be a swi@@ mmer , Tur@@ ner or even F@@ real . &quot;
&quot; but D@@ ool@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fighting in the Olympic trampoline for gold . &quot;
the olymp@@ ic flame illumin@@ ated not every event .
&quot; further from the center , partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ol , arch@@ ery , badmin@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast@@ stroke and let it rule for a long time .
&quot; but if I might make mod@@ est arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me direct the attention to the discreet char@@ ity of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the trampoline has already been a olymp@@ ic event since 2000 , when it had been in Sydney there was the last 16 years so much noticed that many people I asked , did not know that it is at all a Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ art . &quot;
this could also be regional ignor@@ ance .
&quot; although the United States sent Ath@@ l@@ eten for competitions , it has never won a med@@ al in the trampoline and had a athletes that has made it up to the end . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and Chinese and the Canadian , for women to share . &quot;
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend its gold med@@ al from London this year .
&quot; the trampoline has a certain out@@ sider tip , partly because it sounds for un@@ enlight@@ ened ear for a c@@ lown@@ fish as those for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an inher@@ ited enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has hum@@ orous potential - the cur@@ ved trem@@ bling of his never to be absor@@ bed , but also the Grazie of the Turn@@ et and dive , the two sports that are essentially united . &quot;
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; origin@@ ates from the Spanish El trampoline which means as much means as &quot; spring@@ board . &quot;
&quot; emerging winner jump on a gig@@ antic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , real and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet . &quot;
&quot; you are evaluated according to the official Olympi@@ apro@@ gram@@ m after execution , difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; two @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio to each other . &quot;
the common olymp@@ ic v@@ ector is straight .
&quot; med@@ alli@@ ons have to go on in their quest for gold , faster , up@@ wards and dr@@ over , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes occasionally and back , up@@ wards and down to the playground . &quot;
&quot; not only the Zi@@ ell@@ in@@ ie or the starting point , but in the television transfer also another height : that of the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ords . &quot;
&quot; the target targeted is no@@ ble , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even sti@@ r a spect@@ ator . &quot;
but it is also what I am looking for watching these games as something er@@ rel@@ ess .
it offers the trampoline an at@@ rop@@ ause .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a pre @-@ heating movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she pre@@ all@@ t , seem@@ ingly weight@@ ed as an ast@@ ron@@ aut , continues to up@@ wards , then ef@@ fort@@ lessly back up . &quot;
&quot; there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no h@@ ec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves into the distance , only the dream@@ y , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it is such Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be .
&quot; the qualification and ends of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in stre@@ aming for 13.00 Eastern Time ; most of the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will shine the ends as part of a afternoon blocks of both days from 14.@@ 00 .
&quot; in the midst of Olympia Man@@ y they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to over@@ look in general tum@@ ult . &quot;
&quot; when the awareness raising only reaches through the att@@ achment and obj@@ ectivity of male athletes , - as it was the male US Tur@@ ner according to The Wall Street Journal recently , Mr. D@@ ool@@ ey expects his following air ring@@ ing , new fats . &quot;

violent protest in Ethiopia
the political changes in Ethiopia are calling on violent resistance of the government .
witnesses say that zig protest during the cl@@ ashes with the police were killed in fire .
is Ethiopia just together ?
&quot; over the past ten years , it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid hinter@@ land of the West with a fast growing economy . &quot;
&quot; however , in the past few months protests against the government of the country and more and more areas in more and more areas . &quot;
last week thousands of people on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
the response of the government was un@@ mer@@ ci@@ ful to human rights organisations .
witnesses believed that polic@@ emen are shot in zig @-@ armed demonstr@@ ators and killing .
&quot; in the circulation of more sensitive videos about the protests , probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how safety young people hit young people with b@@ loc@@ s , while these were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall . &quot;
the Chief of the UN High Authority of Human Rights is now asking a single @-@ depth study .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country and will be even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most pop@@ ulous country in Africa and its stability is valued by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopia , in order to fight the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if ever , receive so much Western help . &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian economy exp@@ ands in the respect@@ able pace .
its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new pas@@ sports in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ eba .
the roads are generally quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even if Ethiopia was anything but an example for democracy - human rights organisations , the oppression of the government has been led by the government - the opposition in the country has been limited , and vice @-@ pres@@ idents were effectively brought to silence . &quot;
&quot; many were sent into exile or prison , killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert . &quot;
but this could change .
&quot; if you press people and have no other options except to protest it breaks off , &quot; said Sey@@ ou@@ m Tes@@ en , a Do@@ z@@ ent in Central Ethiopia . &quot;
the entire youth is prot@@ ested .
a generation is prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover all from the floor use up to the wor@@ ms regarding the power of the governed coalition .
&quot; after a long @-@ lasting election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the final seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the tensions along the border to Eritrea ; a fight for this z@@ ack@@ y , contro@@ versi@@ al line called in June hundreds of life . &quot;
&quot; analy@@ st fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the Oro@@ mo Liber@@ ation front or the Nation@@ ale Liber@@ ation Front of O@@ g@@ aden , who have been forced over the past years more or less , the turbul@@ ences and others could be armed . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of the exile after years ago is now explo@@ ding under the surface .
the first seems harm@@ less : smart@@ phones .
&quot; only in the last few years many Ethiopia has been able to communicate with social media , as cheap smart@@ phones were increasingly more common and the Internet services improved . &quot;
&quot; even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , particularly in protests , many people can still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies who hide where they stay . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians gave that they gathered together to protest .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ es in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; since ae@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia , mainly Christian High countries , in politics and economy , while they are the Oro@@ mos explo@@ ded , many Muslims are living and living in low@@ lands . &quot;
but even this is changing .
&quot; we are here to coordinate with a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests were held in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have dominated the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated un@@ fair by members of the ethnic group of the tig@@ ray , which are about 6 percent of the population and that are dominant in the military service , in trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel@@ lion leader , was until his death on an un@@ pub@@ lik disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia . &quot;
&quot; he was viewed as a tac@@ tical geni@@ us , a man who could think of the corner . &quot;
&quot; analy@@ sts say that he was particularly dist@@ ort@@ ed to percei@@ ve early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and special subjects to handle opponents and make them det@@ ri@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; the current regime is lacking in this fundamental failure , &quot; says Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia , new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected from relatively un@@ bound@@ less reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray Region of Northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south . &quot;
analy@@ st say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the trust of the tig@@ ray safety services .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time , Ethiopia was born such a rebel@@ lion in 2005 , after thousands against elections prot@@ ested , according to the statements of analy@@ tic seem@@ ingly , and subsequently st@@ olen by the government . &quot;
&quot; while the following razor were killed many prot@@ esters , even though it was less than in the last few months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts , Ethiopia guides for their vision@@ ary infra@@ structural planning , as the new P@@ end@@ ler@@ zug , as well as for their measur@@ able progress in the poverty reduction . &quot;
but obviously this does not affect the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ ery of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and she takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month of gri@@ ff@@ ing protest in G@@ ond@@ ar , a am@@ har@@ ish city , by Tig@@ ray @-@ run shops and the hate towards the Tig@@ ray in the social media is getting more and more . &quot;
analy@@ st say that the protests the US and other Western allies put into a peculi@@ ar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , even though they recently investigated that she has closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West wants to support democracy , he does not want to merge its allies in an already vol@@ atile area . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; is a very thin walk . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp was declared his asser@@ tion Obama was founded IS@@ IS &quot; Sar@@ kas@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tru@@ mp tried to disp@@ er@@ ate the last contro@@ vers@@ y that sur@@ rounds his campaign , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the Islamic State of the Islamic State , not seriously . &quot;
&quot; this clari@@ fies new questions about the communication skills of the presidential system of the Republi@@ can , whether it is in the situation to be clear and understand@@ able with the American public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings his compassion , who take efforts to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protection , in the peculi@@ ar position , statements to explain which he could not meant . &quot;
&quot; after having made the arrival at an election event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp had returned to the asser@@ tion on Thursday and consi@@ sted in interviews that he really did not intended to indicate the President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early Twe@@ et on Friday she said Mr. Tru@@ mp , he is simply sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot;
&quot; the Twe@@ et was the opposition to the previous day , to which Mr. Tru@@ mp was said in a number of interviews , he said the exc@@ use completely seriously . &quot;
&quot; as the conservative radic@@ ator H@@ ugh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tru@@ mp wanted to help prevent the statement somewhat weak@@ en by destro@@ ying him remin@@ ded that Mr. Obama IS@@ IS wants to know nothing about it . &quot;
&quot; the last storm of criticism pr@@ un@@ selt on Mr. Tru@@ mp , while he tries to channel the focus of its campaign due to falling into the economic situation . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton held speeches for the economic situation in Michigan in this week .
on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp tried to return to this subject .
&quot; on Twitter , he war@@ ned that Mrs. Clin@@ tons proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found their speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already brought to its defence sar@@ cas@@ m .
&quot; in the end of July he moved strong criticism of himself , when he said , the Russians should h@@ ears Mrs. Clin@@ tons E@@ mails but he declared &quot; &quot; Nat@@ alie &quot; &quot; I said the s@@ ark@@ skin . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to move the lingu@@ istic limits to politics and then go back to demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages will be added from his fans , how they arrive , and if necessary &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication impl@@ ant who observe the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of def@@ ying the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tru@@ mp has adopted an even estimated note , since its conversion values continue . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal , Mar@@ ist who was published on Friday , showed a tour with a big lead in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ head @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tru@@ mp generally tries to ap@@ olog@@ ise to his pro@@ voc@@ ant statements , he often sh@@ aken his critics , or to understand his statements or his humor wrong . &quot;
&quot; but while he is focusing increasingly in the focus of attention in recent months of its presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s have brought his lo@@ y@@ alen medi@@ ators to the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ant may also be his statements . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mp@@ s most prominent parties , gave great effort to defend the candidates today in a CN@@ N interview . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legi@@ timate , political comments &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani therefore he ques@@ tioned the correctness of Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that Obama was an almost unknown , small organization , he called her Hind@@ gut , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he moved the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most ma@@ instre@@ am Repub@@ lic@@ ans are trying to ar@@ gue that the government served under Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton as an Foreign Minister , IS@@ IS allowed to break down the situation in the Middle East ag@@ gressi@@ vely under control . &quot;
&quot; before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp took his attacks on the media and cast them off on each of his words and be taken up against him . &quot;
&quot; he desp@@ ised the &quot; poor , j@@ am@@ eful &quot; TV experts who try to understand it and said , &quot; You Can &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; some of the democr@@ ats comp@@ elled over Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s exc@@ use as a further proof that he may be un@@ suitable for the presidential office . &quot;
&quot; hung over the price of the market , café in Green@@ point comes back &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a sh@@ ari@@ ous café in William@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years later good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prizes from his Bedford Avenue is pushed onto the front . &quot;
&quot; the business So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , the ver@@ b in summer 2014 , sold , soap in the form of C@@ up@@ cakes . &quot;
native people as the last loss in a gent@@ l@@ ements city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I can still do not believe that CB@@ GB dead , the Chelsea Hotel is taken out and is now a soap @-@ business . &quot;
&quot; but if New York change is , it is also new . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ animated ver@@ b Cafe opened in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepted credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ year old staff of the old cafes , the owner and managing director of the new café . &quot;
he began to work in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
&quot; as a customer offered a customer to provide money for a new outside , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ guez , 36 , retained a lot of things . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verse .
but Rodri@@ guez said he also wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu you stand sand@@ wich@@ es with b@@ acon and cheese and there are Gar@@ ni@@ ings like KA@@ Per@@ n and su@@ cking onions .
there are natural bow@@ ls .
&quot; the café serves no beer more , there are fresh juice . &quot;
after nine months Rodri@@ guez that he noticed a st@@ amped flow of old regular customers .
&quot; many old customers were also pushed through prizes from William@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in William@@ sburg and visited the ver@@ b regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after having moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way forward . &quot;
&quot; after the ver@@ b had closed , she gave a while the coff@@ e@@ pro@@ sci@@ on , she said . &quot;
&quot; to me it was clear that it was on the coffee and the culture in the ver@@ b which was liked to me , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now they drink coffee , even though they are interested in this day instead of their usual I@@ ced Coff@@ ees a Bl@@ ended C@@ hai Tea , which is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a further long @-@ year and faithful customer since the beginning of the year 2003 .
he went there before work and ordered inev@@ it@@ ably always the same .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket clock and they prepare my Every@@ thing Bag@@ el with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ guez , he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients into the menu . &quot;
&quot; nowadays Ros@@ enthal gets still his usual place , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Bag@@ el with b@@ acon , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez he said that he has no gro@@ ll on the fact that the soap @-@ business has taken the old business room .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , offered a special soap for ver@@ b with the cold coffee of cafés as an ingredi@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; I think we will still go into their offer , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated into the board into the Polish and Rodri@@ guez that he has fulfilled it soon , so that his new neighbors feel welcome . &quot;
the site also has other advantages .
a local ju@@ t@@ locally wants to fill the cold coffee in bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the café exp@@ ands on a neighboring building .
for many customers a new ver@@ b is sufficient to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was tri@@ gg@@ y and said that he was destroyed in the ground as the café closed .
&quot; when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the amounts of Lok@@ als and the Order was a new coffee like a home@@ coming . &quot;
&quot; I had to cra@@ w@@ l , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the depres@@ sing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a abundant meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his climb to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
as gour@@ m@@ ets President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined Del@@ ik@@ at@@ essen the Fif@@ th Avenue as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water tor@@ tur@@ tles .
&quot; his menu on that day was somewhat mod@@ est : filled eggs in Tom@@ at@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , pot@@ ato p@@ ü@@ ree and as dess@@ ert a p@@ aving p@@ ud@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with the people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans , as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histori@@ ans .
&quot; co@@ es last book &quot; Ch@@ op Su@@ ey &quot; acted from the Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Zi@@ egel@@ man told in her book &quot; &quot; 97 Orchard &quot; about living in a residential house at the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; your recent cooperation , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at the Har@@ per Verlag , illustr@@ ates the history of the American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; you showed culinary solidarity , when they meet with a repor@@ ter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sand@@ wich Shop to dinner , a small , schn@@ ör@@ k@@ ell@@ os@@ em Im@@ bis@@ s in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which is already in business since the stock market in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a p@@ ach@@ es@@ and@@ wich with Oli@@ v@@ enst@@ ock , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with Pot@@ atoes and vegetable . &quot;
&quot; when the repor@@ ter Hack@@ ne@@ au ordered , this found the pair of discussion on food in the era of the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich food were very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there was Erd@@ n@@ nut , Leb@@ erk@@ se and sav@@ en@@ bread . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredi@@ ent and some tr@@ endy which is stretched .
imagine so many natural shots to eat they serve them as dinner .
CO@@ E gr@@ in@@ ste .
&quot; it must have put itself in the stomach like B@@ lei , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You Can @-@ E@@ at @-@ buffet . &quot;
cre@@ ws of women co@@ ed for male field@@ workers and it became fresh b@@ aked past@@ ed for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; there were the Americans who sent during the first World War food to hungry Europeans . &quot; A Square &quot; &quot; draws the paths to which the country went with it , no longer the sacrifice . &quot;
&quot; it was a time , in the food for the Americans a central , a don@@ ated topic was , &quot; buried Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; just as ten@@ se , the new bud@@ get@@ ing : mysterious food such as lo@@ aves and d@@ asser@@ tions have been repeated as &quot; wonderful kind , me@@ al@@ res@@ te repeti@@ tive &quot; , mer@@ ged Zi@@ egel@@ man , as ch@@ efs un@@ appe@@ tiz@@ ing ingredients were hidden under a creative sau@@ ce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap drying tables .
&quot; meat , the years of the centre of the American food was , became a rare luxury . &quot;
peculi@@ ar mix@@ tures have been tried out since a cal@@ ori@@ ous and nutri@@ tious grati@@ fication was tried before taste or even healthy kitchen .
&quot; during their search for the book , which also includes recipes , bri@@ cks a dish from this epoch , cur@@ ed onions with stra@@ w@@ le butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular supplement in the mid@@ day , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ man leads further out : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ anu@@ t butter and cur@@ ed onions do not fit each other .
it was typical for many of the domestic recipes .
&quot; like never before or since then , tri@@ bun@@ ni@@ fiers - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , Lei@@ er of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 up to 1943 - the eating habits of the country of such . &quot;
&quot; by entering the recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; household tut@@ ors &quot; and the challenge , pamp@@ e like cre@@ am@@ y sp@@ ag@@ h@@ etti with car@@ rots in delicious meals to transform . &quot;
&quot; a Square &quot; &quot; is a celebration of historic delic@@ acies . &quot;
&quot; in particular , reports on the response of the government to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cakes @-@ food attitude . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly pra@@ ised the simple I@@ owa farm@@ houses of his kitchen , he breath@@ ed like the milli@@ on@@ ey man of the world to which he has become . &quot;
&quot; he mo@@ ist continental cuisine like fish with gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
he ate in an almost for@@ ol@@ ed ice room and carried a tu@@ x@@ tu@@ an .
he was delight@@ fully un@@ realistic .
&quot; President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt perhaps have committed the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or asked him to be called an Ex@@ c@@ et with his stomach . &quot;
&quot; as described in the book , the analog@@ y of a household with no interest in flav@@ ours by Mrs Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt , that the White House led the boring food in Washington but also one of the most prepared to prepare . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of great depression , to deal with food was rejected , once the land came back to the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is on our continued focus on cal@@ ories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as science on food was applied . &quot;
the couple gave at the writing of the book the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ mans @-@ in @-@ law was better understood - for example how they could not throw at food .
&quot; she had a real fear of waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man remin@@ ded , &quot; she actually made people sick . &quot;
there were the wind@@ beut@@ lern .
&quot; after the plates at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s ab@@ str@@ ated , she moved and Co@@ e a dess@@ ert that they had prepared at home : the pav@@ ement dess@@ ert , the President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a great tri@@ ck , hum@@ ble recipes a send name to be missed . &quot;
&quot; there was no p@@ ending cream , only p@@ ours , some fl@@ our , sugar , water and c@@ inn@@ amon . &quot;
&quot; everyone de@@ ed something rel@@ u@@ ct@@ antly a spo@@ on in the teeth , bra@@ ve G@@ lib@@ ber . &quot;
surprisingly it does not tasted bad .
CO@@ E took three times a look .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ger@@ er he said to his wife , &quot; A few ch@@ opped Wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
in bom@@ bs attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : K@@ hal@@ ed Om@@ ar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : K@@ hal@@ ed Om@@ ar dedicated his life to man in Syria .
he ris@@ ed everything to save the life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old himself died with a fac@@ bom@@ bs attack of the Assad regime .
&quot; Om@@ ar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil security group that saved the life so far from 6@@ 0,000 people . &quot;
&quot; 29@@ 00 volunteers have their own life to play , to draw people from the bom@@ bed houses and to make their first aid . &quot;
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
Om@@ ar was the face of the group : a video of the civi@@ liz@@ ers who shows him on a 11 @-@ hour saving a baby coming from the ruins of a house he went to the world .
it made the Syri@@ ans to the shining symbol@@ ism in the Gre@@ ys of the war .
&quot; as heroes , he has never seen himself , said loud image : &quot; &quot; for me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I am dying to save lives , I think that God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot;
&quot; shortly before Om@@ ar himself was an attack on the victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b attack in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ters have raised four fac@@ bom@@ bs above the Alz@@ adia district , one was filled with Ch@@ l@@ org@@ as . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven men suffer from breathing . &quot;
&quot; we now eliminate the toxic rem@@ n@@ ants of the bom@@ b , lest children play with it , &quot; quoted the image of his last words before he died . &quot;
the fat@@ al bom@@ b of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Gre@@ enland : the oldest sp@@ one is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Gre@@ enland are usually only in winter to finish .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship .
he was born in 1624 and swi@@ ms with a good one 1 km / h by the North Atlantic Ocean until today .
Gre@@ enland get only over 150 years of offspring .
&quot; fine flo@@ mt of the Gre@@ enland @-@ shar@@ k at the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour he is just about 1,@@ 220 meters wide . &quot;
&quot; only when it arri@@ ves , the five meters is speeds up to 2.6 km / h - and is with this top speed half as fast as a robot . &quot;
&quot; however , that of long @-@ term lifestyle seems to be a patent recipe for a high age . &quot;
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report at the journal &quot; Science &quot; anyway by a Gre@@ enland @-@ shar@@ k , the 392 years old could be . &quot;
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ ool@@ ander from the Max Plan@@ ck @-@ Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Ro@@ stock this life span , which means for vert@@ ine a world ord . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the evolutionary bi@@ ologist has long been that Gre@@ enland @-@ ha@@ un@@ ty . &quot;
only missing the evidence .
&quot; Gre@@ enland are hard to observe , eventually they live mainly in the ice @-@ sea front of the thin @-@ inhabited co@@ asts of Canada , Gre@@ enland , Norway and Spit@@ s@@ bergen . &quot;
because they prefer water temperature around the six degrees Celsius , they dive at the surface usually only in winter . &quot;
&quot; researchers know about the lifestyle of Gre@@ enland , researchers know accordingly little . &quot;
&quot; her time l@@ up@@ ent@@ emp@@ o Make them , when they were first @-@ called six animals with a transm@@ itter . &quot;
&quot; today these hat@@ h make these hat@@ h nevertheless : in the stomach of a animal , the remains of a ro@@ be , another one had swal@@ low@@ ed the pine trees of a young ic@@ eb@@ row . &quot;
possibly she sm@@ elled them sleeping animals or pat@@ rol illi@@ ers at the bottom of the ice cream and look at Kad@@ aver that tor@@ ches from higher water layers to down tor@@ ches .
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues now studied 28 Gre@@ enland , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Gre@@ enland or Spit@@ s@@ bergen , as co @-@ cat@@ ching from the depth of the North Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cen@@ tim@@ eters long , while the largest 502 cen@@ tim@@ eters . &quot;
to determine the age of the animals we analyzed it with the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ method the lin@@ s of shar@@ ks .
&quot; this centre of the eyel@@ ids is already created before the birth of the shar@@ ks , which the proteins are later no longer renewed . &quot;
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a great deal of carbon @-@ 14 in the lin@@ eup .
&quot; their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960@@ s , as an atomic fact , greater amounts of this radio@@ active carbon @-@ carbon into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in the with 220 cen@@ tim@@ eters , length of third @-@ cen@@ tim@@ eters in contrast to carbon di@@ mm@@ ed @-@ 14 out of nuclear weapons , it is likely to have celebrated his 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; all major Gre@@ enland , in their lin@@ ics , had normal carbon @-@ in @-@ 14 @-@ quantities , which is created by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock demonstrated for a 493 cen@@ timet@@ res long grass @-@ shar@@ k at the age of 335 , during the record @-@ H@@ ai with 502 cen@@ tim@@ eters even 392 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Gre@@ enland @-@ shar@@ k only then got off again if they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
&quot; now , the researchers have to as@@ sign an age to the length . &quot;
&quot; because of one of the animals with 392 cen@@ tim@@ eters , probably at the thres@@ hold of lov@@ emaking standing and his age with 156 years was determined , let Gr@@ ön@@ n@@ h@@ y was obviously at least one half centuries of time . &quot;
&quot; also , this is likely to be the world ord for sp@@ ouses . &quot;
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live mainly in icy waters is no co@@ incidence .
&quot; even the previous record @-@ holder , a 211 year old Gr@@ ön@@ n@@ wal , in whose sp@@ eck at N@@ eck a 120 years old Har@@ po@@ en@@ spitze , was imprison@@ ed before Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals often runs on austerity . &quot;
so they are later - and age slow .
&quot; in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals often become particularly big . &quot;
&quot; because the volume is growing much faster than its surface , through which the animal temper@@ ament . &quot;
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much bigger than in one gram elephant .
a further advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives therefore more dangerous and should focus on it as early as possible as possible , &quot; &quot; explains the theory of evolution . &quot;
a very big animal should invest in its resources rather into a long life .

Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; the city on the Main has the best opportunities in competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg to attract the best opportunities from London to rel@@ ieve jobs and companies . &quot;
&quot; it is most likely that Frankfurt am benefits most of the Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the competence of financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is un@@ certain if money to continue to operate from London business transactions throughout the EU . &quot;
&quot; for the so @-@ called EU @-@ Pass , they now extends the approval in the UK . &quot;
this is just big US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; the lob@@ by@@ Association &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; is calculated by 10000 new jobs in the Main , five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , I am the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the euro zone , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance coverage of E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk of the ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the Emergency bank is important for banks , as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; Luxembourg visits a large fund industry , cutting but also like Dublin in the infrastructure . &quot;
Frankfurt is thanks to the big airport much easier to reach .
&quot; furthermore , the city with easily available commercial properties . &quot;
&quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free quality offices , &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; at the Seine , the hir@@ ing for first @-@ class business unit is by 50 percent higher than on the Main . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt is a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime . &quot;
&quot; in a Ran@@ king of the company consulting Mer@@ cer stand the city on position seven , Luxembourg on position 19 , Dublin to No. 33 and Paris . &quot;
&quot; even if quality of life is a question of preference : &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European Intern@@ al Market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors &quot; , &quot; the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; in London , however , in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um of the most important financial centre in Europe will remain my economic for@@ scher . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the coll@@ ages conditions : in London worked in accordance with the figures of the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba at the end of 2015 around 14@@ 4000 people at the bank industry , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2500 . &quot;

&quot; it is common for US presidential channel data to publish their tax exemp@@ tions , although they are not committed by law because of them . &quot;

&quot; natural prot@@ ector in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from being inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with Ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der . &quot;
&quot; the method has proven to be effectively proven and the honey@@ guide Foundation who had already intensi@@ fied the idea , together with the U.S. nature protection , trained in villages in the north of Tanz@@ ani@@ as , a non @-@ violent four @-@ stage method to protect their homes and harvest without inj@@ ured animals . &quot;
previously many speakers have used to defend itself .
Friday is Wel@@ kom@@ otive Day which is dedicated to the animal protection .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we could observe within these communities to change a change to their setting , whereby they can hold much more confident that they can hold the eleph@@ ants from their fields without the eleph@@ ants to harm , so far as the manager of Honey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message . &quot;
the first two steps include the illumin@@ ant of the elephant with a tor@@ ch and the bub@@ bles in a horn .
&quot; if he is not stretched , a so called &quot; Ch@@ ili@@ wol@@ ke &quot; is thrown . &quot;
&quot; Ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der gem@@ i@@ xt with earth is coll@@ ap@@ sed together with a fire@@ works into a con@@ dom , whose end up to the ignition is turned . &quot;

&quot; normally , the St. Go@@ ar@@ er &apos;s investment will take advantage of th@@ wor@@ rying with Kus@@ sh@@ and - but especially the retail in the nuclear city is regarded as obvious . &quot;
&quot; however , the application for the new building of a selling ski@@ cs on the Rhein@@ u@@ fer is located in the immediate vicinity of the Rhein@@ h@@ ug@@ k@@ ons in the immediate vicinity of the town hall , however , the city council now res@@ ign@@ ed . &quot;

&quot; Jewish director , Berliner Hotel , because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; &quot; invitation - RT News &quot;
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots dra@@ ined a media , after having betra@@ yed the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not have an Israeli pre @-@ election as there are Arab guests according to an employee . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of Holocaust &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; left its anger in Kemp@@ in@@ ski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by wrote an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Israel tried to find Israel on the countries of the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed between the countries which can be called directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it in the year 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers a possibility to choose Israel via an own call center . &quot;
after an explanation then the director turned to the hotel recep@@ t@@ ment .
&quot; the answer that he received there , &quot; shock@@ ed him &quot; , &quot; how Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel con@@ dom said that the measure is a &quot; clear decision of the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Hotels . &quot;
&quot; the reason that behind it , holes in the director was even more melanch@@ ol@@ y . &quot;
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs , and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election was deleted , the employees of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli Ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov H@@ adas @-@ trade sman who called this a &quot; &quot; great shame &quot; , &quot; reports the South German newspaper . &quot;
we were escap@@ ed from this event and troub@@ led .
this is really very embarrass@@ ing .
&quot; the fact that this has worn in Germany in exactly this hotel chain , is even greater shame . &quot;
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; , &quot; said the ministers . &quot;
the pre @-@ extingu@@ ish@@ ers have a fairly large reson@@ ance on the Internet from which the people saw a sc@@ andal .
some of the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Hotel found that there would have been the attached to Arab guests .
&quot; ash@@ amed of you , it was named in a different contribution in which it was noted that the hotel , located on the no@@ ble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a synago@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly became all acc@@ us@@ ations of himself and called the inci@@ dent to be &quot; &quot; seeing &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reported Der Spiegel . &quot;
&quot; there has never been a direct statement , Israel not included in the fast list , &quot; the South German newspaper , a speaker of Kemp@@ in@@ ski hotel . &quot;
it adds that the country @-@ election has now been added .

he returned to this statement later and there was no obj@@ ection of Engl@@ ands Riv@@ alen .
with such a victory in victory there was no such problem .
&quot; said : &quot; &quot; it feels like the whole GB flags on the tri@@ b@@ une as London . &quot;
we have come together in the last three months as a team .
&quot; we have come so badly with so many world titles , that it was incredible to win again at the Olympi@@ ad . &quot;
&quot; this is an event , a gold med@@ al for the nation , which were seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the last five months , we expect successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom . &quot;
&quot; with the form of Kenn@@ y it is in the field of Pos@@ sible , that he has repeated Ho@@ ys victory of three Olympic Gold medals in a contest . &quot;
&quot; this would be born for Kenn@@ y - the exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , which was also born on 23 March ( a apparently hei@@ st date for British sport ; on the day , Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster ( born ) - a balance of six gold medals and a silver med@@ al . &quot;
the aff@@ lic@@ le of Ho@@ y is the same .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the Spr@@ int who begins today and will go over three days .
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the Team Event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lon@@ ely to win alone .
&quot; said : &quot; &quot; if he wins two more gold medals , he should be be@@ aten to the Knight . &quot;
&quot; it was the only med@@ al competition of the day , but there were other good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , St@@ even Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the quar@@ k @-@ four @-@ mileage . &quot;
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,9@@ 42 at the finish .
&quot; the world ord , which won in London Gold in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 28@@ 59 . &quot;
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held on the second day of the competition at the Wig@@ gins with safety in the focus .
&quot; he made himself yesterday in front of qualifications before the qualification , as they were functioning , to measure his body size . &quot;
&quot; in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , tomorrow continued and ended , av@@ anced Laura Trotsky@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ soon of Mil@@ ng@@ avi@@ e in Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord@@ s@@ time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB team leaves itself on his strong railway team to domin@@ ate the average period of Olympic Games and to bring a Sch@@ ar to medals .
&quot; after a truly exceptional presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio have been down . &quot;
&quot; they played Dr@@ amas in the background , so the res@@ ign@@ ation of the technical Lei@@ ters Shane S@@ ut@@ ton in April surrounded by Sex@@ is@@ mus@@ k and Mob@@ b@@ ing@@ vor@@ es as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , when one sees the first evening of competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like that the legend@@ ary reputation GB@@ s has reached its peak again to be repeated again . &quot;
the future of mel@@ ting from Port@@ land due to the lifting of the energy amount is frag@@ ile
&quot; the future of the aluminum mel@@ ting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs - stand on the game , as the plant operator will termin@@ ate the energy supplier and thus to raise all the delivery contracts , such as the provider of energy companies . &quot;
&quot; this step was followed by the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsi@@ dies to operate the plant . &quot;
one for 20 years of determining Sub@@ vention runs in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Alco@@ a in Port@@ land stand at stake .
not less than 2000 jobs -@@ direct and indirect - could be at risk of closing .
&quot; in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino@@ effects since the mel@@ ting about 10 percent of the total electricity generation Vict@@ ori@@ as consum@@ es . &quot;
2014 closed Alco@@ a the Point Henry Schmel@@ zer which resulted in the last year to close the Angl@@ eter@@ ea power station .
the mel@@ ting of Alco@@ a in Port@@ land loses money and ris@@ ky a closure .
&quot; this step follows the years of spec@@ ulations in terms of the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Austr@@ al@@ ischen Dollars and last because of the stra@@ ins for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium allo@@ y with its Lo@@ y Yang A Kraft@@ werk in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , shared that three other owners will announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the complex is owned by a joint venture of Alco@@ a and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L goes out that the plant in Port@@ land continues to be operated in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity through the mel@@ ting &quot; , &quot; divided the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L still said that the Tre@@ aties are called &quot; &quot; backup transactions &quot; , &quot; which should come into force from November 2016 . &quot;
the contracts signed a 12 @-@ month cancellation policy so that they will end to 2017 .
&quot; therefore , AG@@ L is assum@@ ing that the contracts will contribute to the revenue in the financial year 17 , &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot;
&quot; all potential impact on the revenues to AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the progn@@ oses of the powerful dead@@ lines for wholesale prices . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L shared that it has already written the value of the agreements already in its annual amount of $ 187 million in the expect@@ ation of a cancellation . &quot;
&quot; Alco@@ a said that the decision to book the tre@@ aties , the &quot; skill of Alco@@ as ... the mel@@ ting to operate or the power supply to the mel@@ ting &quot; is not affected . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. company said that 2010 has concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who should have come into force by November this year , even though it is still a statement showing how it came from the contract . &quot;
&quot; analy@@ sts war@@ n due to the poor economic relations of the industry before the possible closure of the Port@@ land Schmel@@ zer in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle . &quot;
&quot; in reference to the statements of analy@@ st at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land will need approximately 600 Meg@@ aw@@ at@@ ts and Tom@@ ago around 900 meg@@ aw@@ at@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; should both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as electricity producer would not be good , &quot; he said . &quot;
more than just a card@@ as@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the sep@@ tum of the Vo@@ gue
&quot; san den@@ omin@@ ator , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Card@@ as@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner C@@ lan@@ s Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted Sept@@ ember@@ th of the U.S. Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; getting around Est@@ ee Lau@@ der is and went on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ ag@@ ram account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , brought me the sight of this Co@@ vers to wines , &quot; &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot;
&quot; the un@@ vei@@ ling of the Co@@ vers followed a biz@@ ar@@ res ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Card@@ as@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , the entire Card@@ as@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner family show ( with exception of the problem cases Rob and Ca@@ it@@ lyn ) , as well as in the presence of the most popular show@@ biz @-@ On@@ k@@ els and producers of Ke@@ eping Up Ry@@ an Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as she ends the cover of her sister and ends with a classic turn : they all have a surprise party . &quot;
&quot; this represents the cl@@ amping part of nearly every Birth@@ day ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You said that we could have forgotten ? &quot; &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon animation on a must@@ ard court at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to participate their other girl somehow at this Pub@@ licity . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the sep@@ tum of Vo@@ gue , the Vo@@ gue has started a new era of card@@ as@@ hi@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ alls great sister Kim likes it , as far as the Vo@@ gue Cover , struck ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the sep@@ tum &apos;s magazine is a le@@ ague for itself . &quot;
the sep@@ tum is the most popular issue of the year for Vo@@ gue .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference that resem@@ bles more like a picture @-@ band as a mo@@ de@@ time , the output draws a large number of adverti@@ sers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were from the 832 pages of the tab@@ le.@@ 615 pages advertising ) . &quot;
&quot; the un@@ vei@@ ling of his cover stars is expected to be so delicate , that in the last two years images of the magazine can still have the official announcements . &quot;
&quot; women who were already on the cover , includes Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda evangel@@ ista and Kate M@@ oss . &quot;
&quot; in the last few years they were clearly more &quot; Ber@@ oming , the Model@@ ers &quot; as &quot; Models , the Ber@@ üh@@ l &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot;
Oscar @-@ Prize Ki@@ fer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
&quot; even at the low probability that Mrs J@@ enner - is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; flow model &quot; &quot; of its generation - under the former category , it is in good company . &quot;
&quot; these celebri@@ ties are not related to famous people , or Reality stars or young people from today , who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if it is all true to J@@ enner ) . &quot;
they are really talented women who are in the entertainment industry .
Bey@@ once upon the last cover had appeared with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of their career .
&quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ ers do not like any success . &quot;
with her Reality TV @-@ history J@@ enn@@ ers has always been an@@ xi@@ ous in the fashion world .
in June he cri@@ tici@@ zed the influ@@ ential Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephan@@ ie Sey@@ m@@ our J@@ enner and her colleague Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and called them called &quot; the Mist@@ er of the Moment . &quot;
these feelings are back high as the message with the Er@@ seem J@@ enn@@ ers came out on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
&quot; but on the mis@@ ery , it seems to go down at the point . &quot;
san den@@ omin@@ ator is on the cover of the sep@@ tum of the Vo@@ gue .
it is in the true sense of the word a super@@ model .
it works for Marc Jaco@@ bs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters sell you pictures of their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
they sold by her painted pictures of C@@ indy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in their free time she is in the Reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
&quot; counc@@ ill@@ or centers annually , 16@@ 0.000 people &quot;
&quot; more than 16@@ 0.000 of the aux@@ ili@@ aries of the country are rejected annually by the counc@@ ils centres , while the sector is focused on the effects of other mid @-@ abbre@@ vi@@ ations on already over@@ load transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Queensland , three of five people - mostly older persons , immigrants , need@@ y workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just dolph@@ ins and that - in their search for free legal advice and legal advice . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already excessive , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; from June next year , this legal centres will lose some 30 percent of their federal agents . &quot;
&quot; the director of the congreg@@ ation centres of Que@@ esland James Far@@ rell said , that the last survey of the National Association of Joint centres , that already be rejected thousands of people each year . &quot;
&quot; Far@@ rell said , that the situation without a lifting of the decision of the Federal Government would only become worse . &quot;
&quot; Queens@@ lands community centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means thousands of people of important services that you need to be rejected . &quot;
&quot; people who leave non @-@ violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and op@@ pressing debts , families who have been dischar@@ ged through divi@@ ders , workers who have un@@ solved problems - all these people have problems right kind and this survey indicates that they can &apos;t get the help they need . &quot;
&quot; the federal government will be reduced by 30 percent in June 2017 , which means thousands of hel@@ pl@@ ing people from Queensland to be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we call on the gener@@ alities and the Federal Minister of Federal Minister as well as the Sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis to raise it promp@@ tly , so that people can get the help they need to obtain legal problems . &quot;
&quot; in the last year , the state government filled its commitment to raise funds for justi@@ fication on the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to look at the needs of the community centres and their clients , as well as that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government invested in this important work . &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey in front of countries elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) , and Berlin ( 18 September ) sign considerable losses for the SPD of the SPD and CD@@ U . &quot;
this was representative of the expression of the free research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot;
&quot; while the red @-@ black government co@@ atings in the north may continue to be ruled , this is not possible after the restructuring in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party and could therefore have good opportunities to continue the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD adopted by 35,@@ 6 percent in five years ago on 24 percent . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the party is only shortly before the CD@@ U that could come back to 23 percent . &quot;
the third place is contro@@ versi@@ al between the Left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the Left headed for 19 percent ( previously 18,@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would represent 19 percent for the first time in the agricultural day . &quot;
the Gre@@ ens may be hes@@ it@@ ating despite slight losses at 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) again in the sword &apos;s agricultural day .
n@@ p@@ d and F@@ DP would not represent 3 percent in the country in each case .
&quot; according to the Berlin presentation , the SPD in the survey was not only at 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CD@@ U only reached 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
they are still behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) but in front of the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ rodisi@@ ac would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the dep@@ uty house .
&quot; with 5 percent the F@@ DP could hope to return to return , the pirates would be missed in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ mail and Internet in Tim@@ et@@ upe : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market .
&quot; today , the successor to domin@@ ate the world - its manufacturer was living a disaster . &quot;
the unit weigh@@ ed almost a half kil@@ ograms and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was th@@ icker and larger , it was therefore not good in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was pretty kno@@ b . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in store was initially eight meg@@ aby@@ tes , which would be rich today for about two sel@@ ections with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gig@@ aby@@ tes .
&quot; the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; came exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , in the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros , lovers may buy the devices still on the Internet , but they somehow come from the St@@ one@@ age of the Intern@@ al age . &quot;
but 20 years ago the Communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturers had announced the product a few months before at Ce@@ BIT in Hanover as &quot; office in the West Bank format . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone was able to send a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , also by fax was the Communic@@ ator . &quot;
even access to web site was possible via HTML browsers if you are getting too slow .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital addres@@ book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
&quot; there was a small ant@@ enna , and the mobile phone could be opened similar to a lap@@ top . &quot;
then a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen found .
&quot; quite proud was the price : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 euros . &quot;
the average sales price of a smart@@ phones in Germany was published in 2015 at 392 euros .
nobody could see in August 1996 that the Communic@@ ator of the start of the Smartphone @-@ era would become .
since then everything is different .
smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
&quot; the mobile @-@ card of the Finn@@ s lived an un@@ preced@@ ented disaster , was finally sold and handled in Microsoft . &quot;
&quot; today , the market domin@@ ate the market today that all much later came as Nokia . &quot;
&quot; always and everywhere online , this is today for a lot of people everyday . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide . &quot;
&quot; sold about 1,4 billion devices , on Samsung and Apple , about 555 million copies have been sold . &quot;
sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
&quot; to do this , the well @-@ running businesses of the tax@@ ant App provider and telecommunications company . &quot;
around the smartphone is now developed a whole industry .
&quot; the decisive breakthrough for mass market only came at the beginning of 2007 , then announced Apple @-@ Chef Steve Jobs on the Mac @-@ World laun@@ ching the I@@ phones . &quot;
&quot; he spoke three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an internet @-@ communication , everything via touch screen easy to use . &quot;
&quot; the winner of Apple began , even today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who domin@@ ate the market , had the post . &quot;
she disappeared again to fight Black@@ berry .
the s@@ ages now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after its in@@ vention .
the cut still look at his mobile phone today 88 times a day .
&quot; we must learn all to get the smartphone also away , &quot; said just Jan@@ ina sphere , responsible in the Siemens @-@ Management Board of Personal . &quot;
permanent access is now regarded as cur@@ se and blessing at the same time .
England must move the olymp@@ ic spirit and extend He@@ ath@@ row
&quot; He@@ ath@@ row will not only bring to our local municipalities and throughout London , but throughout the country for renewal and prosperity . &quot;
&quot; for me it was the largest attraction of He@@ ath@@ rows , just as at that time in 2012 in London , when we have a great effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions of games benef@@ ited . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will reach again by creating new possibilities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; for our local communities we have already met 10,000 new teachers , creating 4@@ 0,000 new jobs and prepare youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of London in 2012 , there will be such that the challenge of enlar@@ ging He@@ ath@@ rows is too great . &quot;
&quot; I told me that England will never be ready for the games , and that we will push us on the world stage . &quot;
the doub@@ ters had been wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; there are always obstacles to dis@@ appearance , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every question asked . &quot;
how the Olympic Games is He@@ ath@@ row for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .
&quot; expansion is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion to swe@@ eping growth and to leave a legacy of abilities and employment in order to leave the airport as well as in the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have been a great team in He@@ ath@@ row that has been implemented a £ 11 billion for infrastructure investment programme in time and budget , from T5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investment . &quot;
London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am hop@@ eful that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row is also one .
it is time that we channel this olymp@@ ic spirit and create He@@ ath@@ row as well as our future trading and create a legacy of skills and jobs to be proud of .

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; &quot; K@@ atz @-@ und Maus@@ er &quot; &quot; regarding ad @-@ block &quot;
&quot; for companies operating with online learning money , according to one of the software manufacturers , display block @-@ block to handle , a &quot; &quot; cat and mouse @-@ play &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it was scor@@ ed on his desktop side , Ad@@ block Plus released a blog post , in which it &apos;s shared that users may re@@ block their filters in the program to restore advertising in the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that his desktop line would change the enco@@ ding to his advertisements to display it display , which part of the page advertising is to complain . &quot;
yet Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to handle the new codes .
&quot; in a blog post the speaker of Ad@@ block Ben Williams , that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ und @-@ H@@ er @-@ battle between the un@@ ting Open Source Community and the envel@@ ope have been under@@ way since the in@@ vention of ad li@@ cking , and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution . &quot;
&quot; the fact that the world @-@ largest company has left for social media into the fight , is a strong Indian that has become a wor@@ rying indication of the industry . &quot;
&quot; according to a study of the last year by Pag@@ ef@@ air and Adobe around 200 million people &apos;s display lock@@ ers , almost four times as much 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1,@@ 03 billion daily users active users who access Facebook on their mobile devices making hand@@ y@@ ments 84 percent of the press releases . &quot;
&quot; the company has indicated it on display block on desktop PCs aside , because mobile display block @-@ block no effect on Fac@@ ebooks mobile app for social network and inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared a speaker . &quot;
&quot; advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient proportion of revenue from , so Facebook will be the investment of such a step as worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that it would be &quot; &quot; indic@@ ator tool &quot; &quot; to update the people more control over it pul@@ led to them . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook that Ad@@ blocks would have new filters wor@@ rying because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising . &quot;

woman in susp@@ ected self @-@ su@@ icide on the Swiss highway
the victim lay in the midst of the night on the highway .
the police calls witness to after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday with a susp@@ ected su@@ icide of several vehicles on a highway .
the inci@@ dent is located on the A1 near Morges in the cant@@ on of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman laid out in the dark On@@ es &quot; in an act of desp@@ air &quot; in an act of desp@@ air &quot; and were hit by several cars , the police said in Wa@@ adt . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a tale in the age of 49 years , which was run by several vehicles , including a trucks , even to kill themselves . &quot;
it died on the spot .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some are still not identified , the police said these as well as each witness of the inci@@ dent to sign up . &quot;
&quot; it was opened a medi@@ ation process , which is an &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed . &quot;
was a cl@@ ash avo@@ idable ?
&quot; this is something what the pro@@ secution must decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the driver will not be held accoun@@ table .
&quot; in each of the two cases - where a person ran in the dark On@@ es on the Highway - was decided that drivers will not assume that a pedestrian , in the middle of the night on the highway , as it was in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year a police officer was un@@ spoken , after having passed a man and killed a man who was on the A1 near Pay@@ er@@ ne in August 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the 22 year @-@ year victims had dr@@ unk and had become un@@ conscious on the street , and took the dish . &quot;
&quot; the Court set firmly that the polic@@ y@@ ist -- which had responded to an emergency -- on a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the road had an &quot; completely extraordinary and un@@ predic@@ table situation &quot; , &quot; said the judge . &quot;

the Venus was probably once more hab@@ itable according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA Climate Change once .
scientists at the God@@ d@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus by tools and algorith@@ ms that resem@@ bles those of climate research .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have raised with its hot , waterproof surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once er@@ d@@ similar conditions . &quot;
scientists have previously explained that the slow revers@@ ed of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation points that the Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ similar atmosphere and still slowly turned away . &quot;
the model also illumin@@ ated the top@@ ography of early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably proved to be more dry areas than the earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and fo@@ ster@@ ed even faster dis@@ arm@@ ament . &quot;
the early Venus benef@@ ited from a sun that was 30 percent of the matter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS Modell@@ Simulation ex@@ pon@@ ed the long @-@ turning of the Venus her tag@@ ess@@ age of the sun almost two months long , &quot; &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony D@@ el Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this warm@@ ed the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which works like a ra@@ shield , in order to finish the surface of a large proportion of the sun@@ light@@ ers . &quot;
the result are average @-@ temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the earth are today .
the model brought forth a history of Venus that resem@@ bles the evolution that was previously mentioned by Plan@@ etary research .
&quot; although it was probably hab@@ itable , the Venus -- was exposed to a lot of heat and ultra @-@ violet light over the course of several billion years . &quot;
your oceans missed and their water @-@ amp@@ f was burned down from the ul@@ tra@@ violet light .
&quot; as their Hydro@@ gen , only remained a thickness of carbon di@@ oxide with a dead@@ ly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which we know it today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate change in ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Ro@@ y comes back as a coach of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Ro@@ y came back on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led a small @-@ determination to the decision @-@ making process of the team .
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and said that the association will immediately look for a new coach . &quot;
&quot; over the past three years I have met my duties as Chief trainer and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and destiny , the 50 @-@ year Ro@@ y in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; in the course of summer , I am thinking about how I could improve this team to give him more depth to give him more depth , and to bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations perfectly adapted to the organisation &apos;s organisation . &quot;
he also has to have a determination for decisions that influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are not currently fulfilled .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had raised Ro@@ y on 23 May 2013 , thank him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick has informed me today about this decision , &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we all appreciate what he did for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
Ro@@ y was awarded with the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of Jack Adams Awards as the best coach of the League .
&quot; he carried the club on 112 points and on the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was struck up in the first round of pla@@ yo@@ ffs from Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed in each of the last two years . &quot;
the Aval@@ an@@ ches were found in the 2015 @-@ 16 a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand and fell behind the wild for a second Wild@@ Card spot in the Western Conference to five points .
&quot; as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ d , Ro@@ y four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups , won two pieces with the Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the Aval@@ an@@ che . &quot;
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ ve workers take over talks again to put strike
&quot; the labour @-@ struggles for the de@@ bug@@ ging workers will be exposed to the table , while they set all the issues for a new conversation at the table , told negoti@@ ators . &quot;
strike against the O@@ feld@@ service providers Wood Group were spor@@ adi@@ c on platforms in the North Sea conducted by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and r@@ ammed trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to start the dispute process of the current dispute , &quot; says it in a joint statement . &quot;
&quot; we will keep a few day @-@ day meetings in the coming weeks , starting at the beginning of next year to re @-@ address the problems . &quot;
&quot; trade unions said that their final strike , who is the first in over 25 years , a protest against possible wage costs of up to 30 percent . &quot;
wood Group has shor@@ ten@@ ed the re@@ fr@@ ying to its contra@@ dic@@ tors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to neg@@ atively market pressure .
the counc@@ ils of the company follows a 10 @-@ pro@@ lifer@@ ation decrease for on@@ shore contrac@@ tor in 2014 .
&quot; the company said , that additional cuts to the company have the required space to come through the market down@@ turn . &quot;
shell has dism@@ is@@ sed for its part of thousands of people and plans to aband@@ on its oil and gas activities in up to 10 countries since its business activities as a result of his meg@@ az@@ ing combination with the British energy company BG Group ration@@ alized .
&quot; due to lower rough prices , under pressure , an economic situation that had to leave the European Union decision by the decision of the British in June . &quot;
&quot; the Scottish Chamber of Dave Anderson hit the beginning of this week with workers leaders , to discuss one of the largest work strikes , who have found a generation in the Nord@@ see . &quot;
the North Sea is important for regional economy .
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need a economy , which works for many and not only for a few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion are expected to receive new projects in the North Sea compared to average approximately $ 7 billion in the past five years . &quot;
Ke@@ pler &apos;s rot@@ ating rate of stars in the star @-@ cycle of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the newest mission with Ke@@ pler Wel@@ pe teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the full @-@ date catalogue of red rates among the stars of the star of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data helps the astronom@@ ers to understand why stars are rot@@ ate in star @-@ up to different re@@ ats as well as in which context the rot@@ ating periods are involved with the planning process .
&quot; we hope that we experience the same of our results with other clust@@ ers , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of his solar system , Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a resear@@ cher at the Cal@@ Tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the star@@ ry of the P@@ lei@@ ades is located 445 light @-@ years from the earth .
&quot; many of the stars in this star amount , which emerged before around 125 million years ago , are now reaching an adult . &quot;
you are now turning up at the fastest .
&quot; to cut @-@ red rates , these two stars differ large amounts of star@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; since this win@@ ch travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a brake effect on the stars . &quot;
if a star begins to slow down its rot@@ ating rate .
Ke@@ pler moves the rot@@ ating rate of each starb@@ ase by elimin@@ ating the time between the show of an recogni@@ z@@ able observ@@ ance -- like sun@@ spots -- recogni@@ zes .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates shows that the massive stars s@@ lower and more massive stars .
vine compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars s@@ lower pi@@ rou@@ ets rot@@ ating as smaller . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ball@@ et &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors do tend to be massive , even faster rot@@ ors to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; as the star@@ ry of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare qualities as rot@@ ational rates . &quot;
&quot; the star of P@@ lei@@ ades offers an an@@ chor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said H@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; it is still much ahead of us what we would like to learn more about how the How , When and Why stars do slow their rot@@ ational rates , and so tell their &quot; &quot; dance shoes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
R@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in three time @-@ reporting in detail about their latest analysis of the survey rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades that soon appear in the Astr@@ onom@@ ical Journal .
a contro@@ versi@@ al Bas@@ eball @-@ Star goes off
the t@@ ears ran by Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the US Bas@@ eball star in the best days by Base to base .
&quot; after its emotional return announcement , the 41 year old professional was held on 12 August against the Tamp@@ a Bay R@@ ays a last time the Tri@@ ko@@ t of his New York Y@@ ank@@ ees . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Good@@ bye &apos; to both the &apos; stated All @-@ star All @-@ Star @-@ Game participants of Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times Rodri@@ guez became the most valuable players of the League , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Y@@ ank@@ ees . &quot;
his signature under a ten year @-@ year treaty laid him since 2007 annually 27 million US dollars .
&quot; until the end of the congress on 31 December 2017 , he will be in future as a consultant and Jugend@@ coach - at full sal@@ ary . &quot;
as a player paid it Rodri@@ guez long time with performance .
&quot; with 696 Hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 Hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he made some mil@@ estones . &quot;
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e ma@@ ys show only two other bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics similar values .
&quot; however , at the glory of the bas@@ eb@@ alls the 41 @-@ year @-@ old might not be recorded . &quot;
&quot; for so successful Rodri@@ guez - nickname &quot; &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; &quot; - on the field was , so contro@@ versi@@ al is his appearance outside the square . &quot;
&quot; already in 2009 the super@@ star at &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 bought ster@@ o@@ ids . &quot;
in August 2013 he was closed due to a comp@@ lication in the so @-@ called Bi@@ ogen@@ esis sc@@ andal until the end of 2014 for 211 games .
Rodri@@ guez is considered a main @-@ susp@@ ect for years to have received an anti @-@ aging clinic in South @-@ Florida @-@ promoting means .
after a dispute the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; the League could even have done a favor for the year 2014 , for I have played 20 years without a break , &quot; says Rodri@@ guez back anno@@ ying . &quot;
even his far@@ ewell days would not fail .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball leg@@ ends in her last games once again get the big stage , Rodri@@ guez had to sit on the bench . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include any far@@ ewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win every game , estimated Y@@ ank@@ ees @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi . &quot;

caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing must not start the W@@ eight@@ li@@ fter Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski from Poland in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 will be over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official Dop@@ amine .
a sublime athle@@ te would have won almost a med@@ al .
&quot; before the seventh competition , the first official dop@@ ing will become known the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese swimm@@ ers in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter barriers from Bulgaria and the Polish Ge@@ wich@@ th@@ eber Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski have been positive in Brazil and excluded - directly before the start of the already critical sec@@ ret@@ aries , these messages come to infin@@ ity . &quot;
in Ch@@ en the last Sunday the di@@ ur@@ eth@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de has been proven to be used as a mas@@ king means for dop@@ ing sub@@ titles .
the International Sport@@ sman CAS confirmed on Fri@@ day@@ afternoon local time from the Olympic Games .
&quot; on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ year had been the fourth place in the final more than 100 m butterfly , only around 0.@@ 09 seconds they missed the bronze . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en could have to participate in the pres@@ ale over 50 m of the style . &quot;
it has requested the opening of the B @-@ trial at the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) .
&quot; the national association take the matter very seriously and requires Ch@@ en full cooperation with the investigations , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a statement : &quot; we will work with the International Sport@@ sman CAS and will accept the ver@@ dict . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history is no longer the I@@ OC , but the CAS for sanctions of athletes and positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also at night of Rio sick@@ ened the message across the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offen@@ sive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my four test was positive , &quot; this was &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; she said the Bulgarian TV Channel BN@@ T . &quot;
&quot; be inno@@ cent , &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; explained the athle@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it is supposed to act on the dimin@@ ished substance to the blood @-@ offering EP@@ O . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ owa has been sus@@ pen@@ ed , according to BN@@ T and the B test should have a positive effect . &quot;
Bulg@@ arians Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ w entered into account with criticism of the athle@@ te .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not drag the right conclusions , &quot; he said , &quot; We Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many are already excluded . &quot;
&quot; thus , about all the weight of the weight of the chron@@ ically @-@ offering nation are not allowed to take part in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday also the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski &quot; was announced , the London @-@ Olympi@@ asi@@ eger in the class until 85 kg was brought positively on the an@@ gling ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on . &quot;
&quot; both are taking the intake , both are not allowed to start in class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; in front of the start of the lighter , especially the case Dan@@ ek@@ owa is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport . &quot;
&quot; the World Association I@@ A@@ AF had the whole Russian team up to an exception due to systematic dop@@ ings the start , also the L@@ enn@@ fer@@ nation Kenya produced in Rio de bad news . &quot;
&quot; in the swimming sport , the earlier persecution in China had taken care of fier@@ ce conflicts between the athletes . &quot;
so laid out the Fr@@ ench@@ man Cam@@ ille La@@ court the Chinese Olympi@@ asi@@ eger Sun Yang har@@ sch .

&quot; when I see the po@@ dium over 200 m of the style , I will pass myself , &quot; &quot; said La@@ court in the French Radio . &quot;
sun was at the heart of a meditation with the Austr@@ ali@@ er M@@ ack H@@ orton .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing fraud , &quot; said this . &quot;

dat@@ e@@ aster : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ pres@@ sen hack@@ ers their ran@@ som
programmer from Er@@ press@@ ors Mal@@ ware is currently targeted companies - and are successful .
&quot; according to a current survey of the Mal@@ ware Ab@@ wehr ) , Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes under 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany were 40 percent of the sur@@ vey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months at least once , partly several victims of a attack with Er@@ pres@@ ser Software . &quot;
in Germany almost 20 percent of companies have already been the target of a r@@ ans@@ om@@ ware black@@ mail@@ ing .
&quot; 40 percent of the victims would be willing to use those of the perpet@@ rators demanded by the perpet@@ rators , in order to re@@ use the challeng@@ ed systems and data . &quot;
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alize their profit@@ ability Software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes to attacks on Att@@ acks in the Company networks .
&quot; they are successful there , the potentially a ran@@ som ran@@ som clearly higher than with private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying fast evolution of damage software , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ Chef Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ecz@@ yn@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of the mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising . &quot;
then discovered the perpet@@ rators of the press@@ release software for itself .
&quot; first , Privat@@ us@@ er was the target , but the change to company att@@ acking took place in the past months very fri@@ ght@@ ening quickly . &quot;
&quot; R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on the computer of a sacrifice , it looks specifically for un@@ long changed files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as to archives of pictures and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ ted the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware and delet@@ es the origin@@ als sustainable .
then the software presents the demands of the pres@@ ets .
&quot; to get the files to get the files , the victims of money - usually must be covered in the form of cryp@@ tow@@ ed bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; but where with private users the personal photo database is on the game , it is about companies to sensitive customers or project databases without which the production is shut . &quot;
&quot; accordingly higher the damage occurs , if a ro@@ ans@@ om@@ ware suggests . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of the German companies established sales losses caused by R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware , 13 percent even had to break the business activity completely , in case of a case people were in living . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , several hospitals were victims of attacks , whose patients can be threatened by the loss of disease . &quot;
&quot; we say the victims still : pays not , it helps us only the problem , &quot; explains Kl@@ ecz@@ yn@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; however , 80 to 90 percent of firms you pay , their data get back again . &quot;
&quot; for managers it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpet@@ rators in the operation of breast . &quot;
the hack@@ ers again know this and try to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the safety for@@ scher from F @-@ Secure the user @-@ surfaces and the contact with the black@@ mail@@ ed and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to set up a kind of customer service to take more money . &quot;
&quot; you explain their victims by chat , as they can pay by bit@@ coin , set free accessible support websites , or un@@ encryp@@ ted example files . &quot;
&quot; and are individuals after payments of a few hundred thousand Euros , companies must pay some harsh and five @-@ dig@@ it sums have to rede@@ em their data un@@ encryp@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; given the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ik@@ ol@@ ous gains from the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware , the h@@ acker are becoming more professional and share the work , explained safety experts Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the Anti@@ virus @-@ provider Sophos : &quot; &quot; a single person can write a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware about within one week . &quot;
&quot; more likely , however , is that it is three or four people . &quot;
the programmer also sell their damage software in the form of a software building .
&quot; the former Mal@@ ware @-@ kits were created by adding the Mal@@ ware itself , advice and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; included in delivery is a adap@@ tor tool , so smaller configur@@ ations , look and brand@@ ing can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the pres@@ ets are then looking for further hack@@ ers to spread the fresh and bought software under the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; so one is log@@ ging in one of the forums in the under@@ floor , purchases the set of a cri@@ minals and charged another so that the software can install on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
payment is carried out per in@@ fied computer .
&quot; usually , the crime then sp@@ ammer with the spread of &quot; , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the risk of R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware is now known with many companies that secure their data better .
more than 50 percent of the companies listed in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey will trust that R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware via File @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ anned software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursu@@ ing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if encryption of data alone does not provide adequate threat to successful income , the perpet@@ rators instead of sensitive data such as customer lists or pri@@ cing , &quot; explains Mal@@ cin Kl@@ ecz@@ yn@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; with this , the damage potential according to the type of data is still higher than before . &quot;
the perpet@@ rators will continue to take full new goals on the internet of things in future .
&quot; on the Hack@@ er@@ conference Def@@ con demonstr@@ ator safety for@@ scher , as they could get one with the Internet verbal thermo@@ stat under their control . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of winter , the activation of such a blo@@ ated heating could be certainly worth a ran@@ som . &quot;
&quot; if the perpet@@ r@@ ter then instead of the heating in the future will block a whole production road in a factory , R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware could also be a theme in the industry 4.0 . &quot;

&quot; although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers must have a lot of space in the first row as well as in F@@ ond . &quot;
the materials of the interior are well finished and work pleasant , only the cock@@ pit @-@ side falls down there . &quot;
versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V at the storage room .
&quot; it is not just a trunk of 453 l at high @-@ level and 10@@ 26 l in ren@@ ches back back@@ ups , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot;
&quot; this is less magical , as it sounds : the seating area of the back@@ bank can be high as Kin@@ os@@ chairs and thus offer storage space , from the ground up to the blan@@ kets 1,@@ 24 m high . &quot;
&quot; the boot room can be loaded well , but the loader @-@ height with 650 mm is slightly higher than the equivalent of Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the tested 1,6 @-@ l @-@ diesel with 88 kW / 120 HP acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to the rotation of up to 300 Nm in wide turning areas very powerful .

&quot; however , this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests will show the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the case , a family on the second day of their tur@@ qu@@ oise @-@ mor@@ ant was difficult to di@@ arr@@ he@@ ed and vom@@ iting . &quot;
it spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
&quot; your disease led the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a def@@ ective cl@@ amping situation , which alleg@@ edly contamin@@ ated the sea@@ water . &quot;
&quot; the family was the view , the trip was so poor - and def@@ endant against the organiz@@ er . &quot;
the law@@ suit was not a success .
&quot; although , the cl@@ amping situation was in fact def@@ ective . &quot;
but the operator was just shortly before departure of the h@@ unters .
he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; so he did not hurt his information , so the judgment . &quot;
especially in the rehear@@ s@@ als of water no pollution were found .
the disease of several hotel guests - bl@@ ur@@ red by cont@@ acting each other - belong@@ ed to the general living risk of life .

the last much discussed silence for doctors should remain in accordance with de Mai@@ zi@@ ères .
&quot; however , he wants to search for solutions in dialogue with the doctors &quot; doctors , as the threat of the citizens could be reduced , he said with a view of the mental at@@ balls . &quot;

better traffic flow on the motorway junction
it is regularly located on the move @-@ way - here &apos;s a picture of November .
&quot; however , that is to change : the right direction should be extended . &quot;
&quot; this is good news for all the car , who are looking at the ambi@@ tion road every evening in the barn . if they drive over the highway , Z@@ ub@@ r@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
the road building is extended by the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the hammer street and the departure of Wes@@ eler Street the right direction of 700 meters .
drivers can then catch directly from the hammer street on the right .
the great advantage : the traffic is the early on which the total cost is improved on the promising section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U S &amp; D Group in the District Apost@@ le Münster @-@ West .
driving distance on the to@@ ub@@ r@@ inger ed@@ t the motor@@ ists above all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
&quot; week@@ days dates back to the bridge over the Alber@@ ta@@ her way , and sometimes also beyond . &quot;
the reason is the con@@ i@@ fers on the B 51 shortly before the departure of Wes@@ eler Street .
from here the traffic will only lo@@ ur@@ ged over the motorway sal@@ ary .
the second sp@@ ur had to be returned to a well @-@ quarter years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations had sur@@ render that the bridge has no longer required the required power , in order to absor@@ b heavy traffic two @-@ hand traffic . &quot;
&quot; how long of this bott@@ pass , and the associated stability will last , the continuous state can not be said . &quot;
&quot; however , with years to expect : for the bridge has an official rest of time up to the year 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the law firm , the govern@@ or has been aware of the traffic @-@ weak@@ ened time in the school vacation , because with disabilities to be counted . &quot;
the traffic will be held on Tuesday and on Wednesday at the end of Wednesday .

rain instead of star@@ fish : hope for weather
the weather has made the star@@ ry Gu@@ ards in the south @-@ west of Germany during the night to Friday a st@@ acked by the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was bad because of clouds and rain would have been bad for watching the heav@@ enly spect@@ acle , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Fri@@ day@@ tomorrow . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather is supposed to be good , then we certainly see many star@@ fish in the sky . &quot;
&quot; in the star@@ ring , it is per@@ sei@@ den , which belong to 216@@ ,000 kilometers per hour to the fastest star blocks . &quot;

relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
&quot; in the evening , you walk around forever , at night it is st@@ opping long , in the morning it is far ahead of the dirt @-@ ring@@ ing out of sleep . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , you have such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institut , approximately one quarter of adults can sleep and more than ten percent they often find their sleep often or permanently rec@@ ant . &quot;
how does sleep problems or sleep ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleeping disorders , and there are many causes of underlying causes , Hans @-@ Günter We@@ came , stres@@ ses the member of the German Society for sleeping research and health care . &quot;
&quot; what you understand is in common , but the In@@ som@@ nie , therefore , is an inhal@@ ation and as@@ le@@ ep . &quot;
&quot; right to sleep many people as uns@@ atis@@ fying or in@@ sufficient , says J@@ ens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , says member of the German Haus@@ dentist with practice in the Dutch Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind sle@@ eves ?
the causes of sleep functions are complex .
&quot; behind this , organic , psych@@ ic or behaviour @-@ related factors , but also medicines are stuck . &quot;
not rarely is the disturb@@ ing expression of another disorder .
&quot; very early awakening is above all in depression often , &quot; says We@@ come . &quot;
and it can be that various factors face each other .
&quot; who for example has a band@@ age case , can be bad , aw@@ ake every two to three hours and it starts to greet you about everyday problems and we get bl@@ onder@@ ing , there is a example . &quot;
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
when should one be done with sleeping disorders to the doctor ?
&quot; who has not sleeps about a period of a month in at least three nights per week and is affected by the day , should go to the doctor he was going to go . &quot;
&quot; the imp@@ air@@ ment may look very differently : one is down@@ cast , tired , un@@ fold , has difficulty with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has constitu@@ encies or bodi@@ ly discomfort such as stomach or head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; to alle@@ vi@@ ate the bed@@ ding , it is important to find their causes . &quot;
&quot; as a treatment options , among other things behaviour changes , a cogni@@ tive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or even medicines - classical bed@@ bugs have only for two weeks - in@@ issue . &quot;
&quot; there is hardly any population health care in Germany , stres@@ ses Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the Interdisciplinary Research Center of Char@@ ité University Berlin . &quot;
&quot; that is why one should first turn to sleep , in front of sleep , we@@ ave . &quot;
the problem may be clari@@ fied with exam@@ inations whether the problems have a physical cause .
&quot; who should in sleep , and what happens there ? &quot;
&quot; for exam@@ ining in the sleeping German medicine , for example with snor@@ ing with respir@@ atory , in disease , or if you do not find the cause of a di@@ arr@@ he@@ al@@ ment , explains Fi@@ etze . &quot;
it is not necessary to prepare for the investigation .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; only please do not make lunch , &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
after the sales you go to his normal time in bed .
&quot; in addition to the electro@@ des in the body , one carries a nose glasses , a chest strap and a blo@@ oming in the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera to the ceiling is shown . &quot;
how can you get the problems with the handle ?
there are quite a lot of actu@@ ators to which you can put for a better sleep .
&quot; wo@@ und counts : regular sleeping , and ste@@ al times , not too long in bed lying , not to sleep in bed , not to sleep , not to watch the watch , alcohol avoid and at night - then it starts immediately to be reck@@ oned , and that is quite and not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ble . &quot;
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming has to have
the former German swimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has expressed himself on Facebook to dis@@ appoint@@ ing the D@@ SV team at Olymp@@ is .
&quot; in December 2014 , he was brought up for the first time in Doh@@ a for the first time in Doh@@ a , and presented his first pupp@@ y ord at the same time . &quot;
now the former D@@ SV @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler via Facebook collabor@@ ative before his work in the criticism of ex @-@ team mates .
&quot; in a country where a Olympi@@ ast@@ le 20,000 € Pre@@ mie gets and a jungle qui@@ pped 15@@ 0.000 € should no one be wonder@@ ing about missing medals &quot; , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old on the night on Friday at his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the conveyor system in the swimming pool is bad , the dop@@ amine very well . &quot;
&quot; in this way , we cannot compete with countries who do so much to promote and operate as well as in the subject of dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t say that here the controls should be adjusted , &quot; he explained on . &quot;
&quot; if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler would have to be reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency Germany ( N@@ ada ) . &quot;
it is exactly that you should keep it with countries too .

airport : ban@@ de of baggage captured
professional Di@@ ebe at the Airport Düsseldorf
&quot; civil war , the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police arrived on Thursday the capture of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 . &quot;
the Tat@@ susp@@ ects had committed as a ban@@ de several pick@@ po@@ ckets and baggage .
&quot; against 21.@@ 30@@ pm , official officials in the area of the airport Düsseldorf , a ban@@ de again , which was known to the polic@@ emen from the past theft . &quot;
the two women and two men had committed several Del@@ ik@@ te since the middle of July .
&quot; the experts of the crime inter@@ ab@@ ari@@ ate 34 can add the diver@@ gence of criminal off@@ ences to Germany , four acts . &quot;
they had a total of more than € 15,000 euros .
&quot; newly built , a couple of Lin@@ den@@ b@@ äum@@ chen , meanwhile , the Rig@@ aer street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain affects the first glance , but the police are among the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; the road from East to West goes along , one comes on play@@ grounds , a refresh@@ ing nursery and a bi@@ ol@@ aden . &quot;
on the fac@@ ade of a gray house someone has a ug@@ ly ! &quot; audi@@ ted !
&quot; opposite from a Li@@ dl that will also be dem@@ ol@@ ished soon , is already built : until 2017 , here a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments arise . &quot;
&quot; article on these &quot; tr@@ endy district &quot; , &quot; as the constant real estate company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain is called , in the last weeks , however , we preferred with burning cars . &quot;
&quot; the house is equipped with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the inhabitants are occupied , but on the ground floor are still rooms are occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , H@@ enk@@ el has spoken many times for a hard action of police against the project as &quot; no @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as a starting point of autonom@@ ous violence . &quot;
&quot; after 22nd June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ smi@@ ths have been clear@@ ed with 300 police officers , with 300 to 40 officials and three teams on site , sp@@ err@@ ed parts of the street and held visitors to enter the house with number 94 . &quot;
throughout its renovated construction workers on behalf of the unknown land@@ owners the rooms .
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin administration court decided that the clear@@ ance was illegal and one day later went out police and buil@@ ders under the jew@@ els of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; in this summer afternoon the road peaceful : parents go with children , sit with children sitting on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others are enter@@ tained sp@@ ät@@ tis . &quot;
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects lie a primary school and children &apos;s gardens .
&quot; left force is not the main orge of many bonds : Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives since 1999 in the region , and Jana * , who spoke here three children , mainly from the police presence . &quot;
with the inhabitants of the household projects they share the concern of rising ten@@ ets and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
&quot; it does not sound like a pine , which is multi@@ lateral police protection against the left side . &quot;
&quot; the dit@@ ch , which of the Berlin Wall and the police went up between home and its neighbours , thus does not exist . &quot;
&quot; peaceful settlement in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers &quot; quarter , which even today in comparison to the rest of the city a lower Average mean and high ar@@ ut@@ s@@ risks . &quot;
&quot; also house @-@ occupied and the resulting residential @-@ projects have been part of the region : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former G@@ DR , including almost the whole Main@@ zer street very close to the Riga . &quot;
&quot; while the main@@ zer had been clear@@ ed under large police officers in a down@@ right road , many of the projects were leg@@ alized within the Rig@@ aer and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district in recent years has become increasingly becoming a magn@@ ets for tourists and elect@@ rom@@ echan@@ ics from all over the world : with them now divide them out of G@@ DR Roman times and former home@@ away . &quot;
this is also noticeable in the hir@@ ing which has increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ aer are attacked as symbols for this development : one recognis@@ es them into the cor@@ ded sli@@ ces or fresh@@ ness st@@ alls that have been raised with colors .
&quot; no other road , this year was so often mentioned along with the words &quot; left @-@ autonom@@ ous authority &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; one reason for that not all neighbours might be seen as a problem , that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as bodi@@ ly injury are evidence almost exclusively against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; the most part of the criminal off@@ ences make alleg@@ ations made , the ten@@ den@@ ci@@ ally rather the new buildings and newly renovated homes . &quot;
&quot; for Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rental house next to the contro@@ versi@@ al 94 years , there can be no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as far as violence does , it is embarrass@@ ing : the people in the 94 are their neighbours , that certainly did not have been . &quot;
even the famous burning cars do not give it directly to the Rig@@ aer no longer .
&quot; for the studied architectural feature is her street no crime focal point , on the contrary : &quot; &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the road and gets more each other than what else . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliber@@ ately drawn into the Riga street - and remained .
&quot; therefore , it was also so important that the assu@@ mption had returned its street : from the police , politics and the media , which suddenly appeared in July all the interpretation of the district . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to be taken away : by re@@ plac@@ ements new buildings in the former buildings that the old inhabitants are pushing . &quot;
&quot; these are not con@@ dom@@ ini@@ um , which are not interesting for many here - here are rather people who are not so good , she says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction can I have absolutely no real @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; but what should we do , if one never listen to someone ? &quot;
&quot; on all sides of fru@@ stration , even in the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; for audi@@ ted , the spread of color bom@@ bs , Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the home @-@ projects and the lef@@ tist scene belong@@ ed to the pine forest . &quot;
&quot; who runs , should be aware of it - just like someone who can complain in a pub , there is bad about noise . &quot;
&quot; all persons provided with the names we have asked , not to be called by their correct name . &quot;
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ Ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is new refugees
Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is the contact in terms of integration and organizational structure .
furthermore it is social worker in front of the village .
since July Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le the refu@@ gee Ap@@ ts for Ur@@ bach .
the social programme supports the team of administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ ck@@ en@@ berger .
&quot; it looks as contact for all players : refugees , working environment refu@@ gee aid , administration , authorities and who else . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer from the colleague indicates that the volunteers are more than thank@@ ful that D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le now is , the ei@@ er@@ leg@@ end Woll@@ mil@@ chs@@ au , which is above all a problem . &quot;
&quot; in this way , some - less potential than rather than on the multitude of desire areas , meant that the administration wanted to write the place . &quot;
&quot; sought out a administration of administration with a talent for languages and people , linked with a long @-@ term experience in the field of social work , just a high @-@ leg@@ end Woll@@ mil@@ chs@@ au . &quot;
&quot; but administrative work is not its central area , the Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organization , work with the local people and also behind the scenes as well as ma@@ ins . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been around for around six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent place on three years of temporary .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer , that Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le honor@@ ary and full @-@ official actors support . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems . &quot;
&quot; soon , new container are available in the Was@@ strasse &quot;
&quot; there has been a serious problem for some time , which have been recognized for the connectors that have been recognized . &quot;
for the connectors are the municipalities .
you must accommodate refugees in their own or rented apartments .
&quot; the cost of construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must bear the municipalities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from land @-@ vel@@ vet to the Commun@@ e and Job@@ center .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment . &quot;
the search has been designed for some time as very difficult .
de facto administration has no private apartments .
&quot; it has not been working so far , be dependent on private apartments , so D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the common apartments must be ev@@ oked , as it is so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; so soon , new container will be placed in the Was@@ strasse . &quot;
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a fixed lead , there are intern@@ ships , training courses , school@@ ing , a @-@ euro jobs and pro@@ gression for refugees and migrants that need to be found or established . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the Bau@@ hof or help house@@ masters , carry out @-@ profit work - and the motiv@@ ates and very tidy , like Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
they hopes that the work for the common and positive effect leads to a positive effect .
&quot; that is &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity is not just work .
&quot; the day will need a solid structure , say D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a belonging .
&quot; so , there are offers such as sport , contacts with n@@ atives and especially Spanish courses . &quot;
professional courses are key@@ gen .
so you also jump to manage and honor@@ ary official .
&quot; it was central that the refugees get the feeling , they be desired in Germany and welcome . &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; you must declare the refugees that it will take , and it will be useful for them , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who will eventually develop the feeling , he could no one could not work in Ur@@ bach nobody , thir@@ sty and be un@@ n@@ üt@@ z , which will never be integrated . &quot;
the clear majority was motivated .
&quot; problem cases , however , there is also , says customer honest , &quot; people , in which nothing is going on . &quot; the work of D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer therefore always is to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
&quot; this is all a &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : have the two according to recent occur@@ rence fear of radic@@ alisation , even in a small church like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer very clearly , &quot; what some may be nai@@ ve &quot; . &quot; a balance @-@ risk could possibly could and w@@ ool it . &quot;
&quot; sensi@@ tiz@@ ing , the hel@@ pers were already . &quot;
these inci@@ dents were also subject to refugees .
they would have fear that the attacks they complete fully in dist@@ ort@@ ation .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with that , &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; so , the main and honor@@ ary time must hold on site and in the region according to activities . &quot;
they have always in the background that soon a new shock could come to refugees and migrants to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a ceiling ?
that question is clear to answer the politics .
&quot; actually , it is unfair to put them away from the spot . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we are not yet there , where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , that would relax the location . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher have already asser@@ ted with it , the past people are reasonable . &quot;
&quot; these are currently around 100 people , mostly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , they need to help them are both women . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complex , there are no simple answers . &quot;
