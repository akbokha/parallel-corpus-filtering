<seg id="1">Clintons and Trumps Economic Policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing the trade agreement - they want both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two US presidency have however been present in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental matter."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a basic, rather philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">The report on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep the doubt rather small in doubt and warned how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to punish the economy to death and regulate the economy he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in contrast, he would be quite different, claims Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will return to the regulations, and he makes for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax-sets strong - for individuals and for companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton says: the state has given certain tasks to meet, he has disadvantaged opportunities and need money."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, taxes would increase for the rich, says it."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in the nuts, Trump and Clinton are almost protected."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic applicants predominates the greatest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">"state investment programmes into the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are rejected by the state-critical teamwork of the Republican."</seg>
<seg id="16">"thus, the Trump could also come to cross-party discussions."</seg>
<seg id="17">More evident are the differences in energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-power plants and recovering the coal production in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="19">"oil promotion is also intended to be possible to terminate in so far protected areas, the Paris climate agreement wants to terminate it."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in contrast, Clinton wants to expand its investment programme specifically with their investment programme:" "a country will create the super power of clean energies and create millions jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want that we are."</seg>
<seg id="22">"but not only in infrastructure - even with international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from one another."</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpaziical trade agreement, do not want to sign up. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both the US does not want to isolate the U.S. from international trade - but simply to protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">"these should then be paid better, for example Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The present minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a famousness.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must rend, then he says he should not be altered."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop tax policy on both camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand, Trump, who wants to disclose the economy and the citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics are holding him so that the household deficit would only be greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton is to ask at least from the rich people that they pay more taxes and their critics are saying, more taxes are also not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="13">Until you speak with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it is the organizer of Condrobs, a carrier for social assistance in Bavaria, and deals with the topic of women on the flight."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are refugees.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Münchner north in one of the few decentralized accommodations for alleged women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January Condrobs made the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Münchner Women's aid.</seg>

<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>

<seg id="21">The exception is a wax in front of the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here, has made their flight experiences with sexual violence," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="23">Men's going to wars because they are politically prosecuted because they drowned torture or death because their families may send them as hopepers to Europe.</seg>

<seg id="25">"in their home they have experience with sexual violence, forced, honorary, honorary, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">This is what drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">The flight continues.</seg>
<seg id="28">"that tugs call for example for a bottle of water a sexual act is not rarity," "says Bahr"</seg>
<seg id="29">"and the women are alone, they are not protected by their families."</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believe that the end, as soon as they came in Germany, irre, tells Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"also here, all women in refugee camps were often considered as a minent and worst."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this leads to that about 90 percent of women living in the north of the Münchner north, they are underestimated."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not optional."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so used to say that they say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't trust, openly about the experience, because the shame is too great."</seg>
<seg id="36">"since they often don't afford to help, there are more accommodations just for them, calls."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees."</seg>

<seg id="40">"also in Schwaben are not separated only refugees, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, Press meeting of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Oberbayern, Lower and Mittelfranken there are some shared floors or separate houses just for all women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">The committee's rights and gender equality in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommodated by men.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study that has been published for the Committee, it is:" it is very important that men and women are being separate. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"if the privacy or become involved, men and women are accommodated together, it can become an ongoing - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"above all, the washrooms should be easily accessible and easily accessible to women, stands in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"how much the women feel that needs of this protection, one can take place at the Andvertising that it is available to the house in Munich."</seg>

<seg id="8">I could not count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also said that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even better."</seg>

<seg id="20">At once it seemed as if the Turks would pay for anything to blame.</seg>

<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the benefits of a cease-fire are clear on the hand."</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is in the first place all friends who can get it after the last month with a failed coup d almost at the top.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey also have shaken him.</seg>

<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have met Turkey - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast."</seg>

<seg id="37">Ankara is angry on the West because it's reaction to the tried and tried power of power than weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in addition, the continuing Groll on the Schneckentempo of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the erpike is to pull out of the cool mood and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West."</seg>

<seg id="40">"for Moscow, it is a matter of course for Moscow, which has a profound fear of regiment."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit meeting in this gloss palace was made by Russia and Turkey, one, as it was a analyst once described," Alliance of recipropagation, "" Alliance of reciprocal "": two countries that betray away from the West and have been poorly treated. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two still big differences."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the greatest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently been the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support these pages."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be significant that after nearly three hours of first meeting both president on the press conference, they said that they would not have striped the issue."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey vasted it to respond to a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British maturity repulled his immune system and worgereflex in a serious examination - by doing some of the most dirty and ekarest places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the moderator and author Ian Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shaded its course on a Euro shock, a nest on the Piccadilly Circus, a dishwasher at a tractor and a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resistance of its immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before the lending of any object he used a Luminometer, to show up and show us on what he will behave."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment made under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength "was filmed, brought some surprising results to daylight."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought to check the dishwasher, which was already used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but actually are in a kitchen washes more bad bacteria."</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe Mr. Wright said Mr Wright with physicians and medical professionals across the promotion of Darmbbacteria and his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">"luckily, nothing left what he shifted, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Mr Wright has been known to test the resiliency of his intestine by the world richest and peculiar as well as wonderful things."</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public funds to train stations to dishwashers of toilets, the task set his immune system definitely under a sample."</seg>
<seg id="11">"he told in the movie:" already as a child I was relatively unconcerned what my health concerns and I have raised all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud-water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he became his reputation in any case.</seg>
<seg id="13">"the funny what he refused, was a dirty public toilet in Russia."</seg>
<seg id="14">His prowed showed a leuminous value of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to this, the Luminometervalue is fresh washed hands less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to check out after their Luminometerisation over 4000 units was, while fresh washed hands one of less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturers of dairy products Valio produced the film film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" which shows the bacterium in different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says:" "this comes the worst, which I used in a toilet, near."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">"I will not hide anything here, because it is inadequate here."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company stacked Mr. Wright with Valio freeze as well as vitamin C and D as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of bacteria and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" "we wanted to offer the consumers really something new."</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time the benefits of probiotics explains.</seg>
<seg id="25">"we led crazy Brainstormings through which we endowed, that we said" "Lass us Ian." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in Darmstadt is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of the intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with a documentary we could provide more information on an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who led the rainy of the film, added:" "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had spoken to him, just like the ekelty Russian toilet, which is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course there were things, in which it was easier to bring Ian to bring them up, and others, in which this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty deeds.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in one of Validato, 84 percent of all respondents were also associated with the wellness of stomach and intestine, in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestine and 58 percent, that they are at least occasionally used products that have attached milk-bacterial bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the multiplication of Schallplatten does not want to greet a boom in millennials who would like to greet the novelty of physical objects, but to the Midlife nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently purchased a record are of all preorder according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely corridor group."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes through hobby collectors - it has an emotional importance: older turntables retain their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog would be a news report on television, I would follow me the camera while in the midst of a busy street in Soho, a humble gray ascent and wild, before I stop my hands and something possessing, saying," "so, let's throw a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">"so, let us take a look at it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"even if the heart Soho slowly in its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent seller were located - there is still a handful of fantastical disc."</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I enter by Sister Ray (data count: eight young women, three men aged man) into the Reckless Records (data number: eight men aged man, a woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already say," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3.000 or 4.000 boards.</seg>
<seg id="17">"this sounded plates, shown above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I have not followed him home), dress the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles, the result of his available income is now able to purchase plates that he could not afford to buy, when they appeared and again items to buy, which he sold, when he was young and plagues."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I bought, are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared, when I was 11 or 12. things, in which I probably was something to buy it, he says."</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who are buying records, rather introverized and like to spend their own time and adds:" I don't smoke and I drink no much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my blaster.</seg>
<seg id="22">"AMZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, believes that many customers who meets the YouGov's Profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"he has also noticed a new wave of people that will have influenced by the media, people who have heard about comeback and see themselves again to buy their old records again."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations that I have led, people usually have been initiated by 1998 or in 1999 of their collection."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who have sold their boards to buy CDs now, buy their CDs, in order to buy their records again," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the Boom to followers of the record-revivals of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the attached emotional significance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to recognize that record is a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to WEZ, some of the older customers took their impetus to the contact-free payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world, and would like to withdraw to the stability of trusted sound plate, from objects, the happy jugences."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it may be the filling of a void or the possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," says WEZ. "</seg>
<seg id="32">That's like a collector so I think it is with many people so.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social worker!" flushed an employee of a record-stack.</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey of the ICM in April was revealed that almost 50% of the people, the last month has bought a record, they have not yet heard."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found out that 41% have a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who have a record, no turntable."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of the news report, I probably would most likely look very concerned while I concised through a stack of Bossa Nova Kompilots."</seg>

<seg id="40">"this is not a large percentage, but it is definitely going to happen."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more articles, less musiclasy."</seg>
<seg id="42">"we have people who say," I have no turntable. "</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older ones who only come slowly."</seg>

<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, runs on the store for several minutes and views the variation of the sale of the sale. "</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a bucket of scout than a big one.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it doesn't deserve much, therefore the collecting of plates is not a real option, it says."</seg>
<seg id="51">It is much.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it is easy to listen to music from a computer or another way, but the beauty of plates is..." she is driving with a loving swing. "</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it is really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">"my last stop is a business, which is said that a new generation of turnlovers is to have inspired: urban outfitters."</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I give the credit, the jeans-hotties, watching a group of young teenager, which will be grouped for a moment to buy Polaroid cameras before a father and daughter to buy a crosley turntable."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"nobody can see themselves - maybe because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to use them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that every attraction for these items mean more money for the industry, and some customers could send to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"there is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, also the one that is most common for luxury areas such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even if my post-studies have agreed that the results of YouGov's vote, let them, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female bands and record lovers, who exist in reality, downs and in online-foren, unconsidered."</seg>

<seg id="18">We have to get around the rest of the rest.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday morning Bam opened the Torrigen in the first half of the game with a backlash from the closeness.</seg>
<seg id="20">"India was gone without victory in the tournament in the game, but the team showed surprisingly crazy and held the game of 1-0 to the third quarter, up to Bam the game into their hands."</seg>

<seg id="5">"you can not switch to the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the queue in the queue, without using Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is still Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's black with dimples, could well be sent under these known names which might be sent to Prime Time through sponsors and well-being-TV advertising, if he would be a swimmer, Turner or even Freal."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fighting in the Olympic trampoline for gold."</seg>
<seg id="9">The olympic flame illuminated not every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted: air pistol, archery, badminton, Taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breaststroke and let it rule for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I might make modest arguments for my particular darling, then let me direct the attention to the discreet charity of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline has already been a olympic event since 2000, when it had been in Sydney there was the last 16 years so much noticed that many people I asked, did not know that it is at all a Olympiasportart."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the United States sent Athleten for competitions, it has never won a medal in the trampoline and had a athletes that has made it up to the end."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and Chinese and the Canadian, for women to share."</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend its gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the trampoline has a certain outsider tip, partly because it sounds for unenlightened ear for a clownfish as those for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an inherited enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humorous potential - the curved trembling of his never to be absorbed, but also the Grazie of the Turnet and dive, the two sports that are essentially united."</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" originates from the Spanish El trampoline which means as much means as "springboard."</seg>

<seg id="2">Violent protest in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">The political changes in Ethiopia are calling on violent resistance of the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that zig protest during the clashes with the police were killed in fire.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just together?</seg>
<seg id="6">"over the past ten years, it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid hinterland of the West with a fast growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"however, in the past few months protests against the government of the country and more and more areas in more and more areas."</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The response of the government was unmerciful to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses believed that policemen are shot in zig-armed demonstrators and killing.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the circulation of more sensitive videos about the protests, probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how safety young people hit young people with blocs, while these were forced to make a handstand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The Chief of the UN High Authority of Human Rights is now asking a single-depth study.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country and will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is valued by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopia, in order to fight the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if ever, receive so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy expands in the respectable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new passports in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are generally quiet, safe and clean. "</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia was anything but an example for democracy - human rights organisations, the oppression of the government has been led by the government - the opposition in the country has been limited, and vice-presidents were effectively brought to silence."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent into exile or prison, killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But this could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you press people and have no other options except to protest it breaks off," said Seyoum Tesen, a Dozent in Central Ethiopia. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth is protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation is protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover all from the floor use up to the worms regarding the power of the governed coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a long-lasting election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the final seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, the tensions along the border to Eritrea; a fight for this zacky, controversial line called in June hundreds of life."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analyst fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation front or the Nationale Liberation Front of Ogaden, who have been forced over the past years more or less, the turbulences and others could be armed."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of the exile after years ago is now exploding under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in the last few years many Ethiopia has been able to communicate with social media, as cheap smartphones were increasingly more common and the Internet services improved."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, particularly in protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies who hide where they stay."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave that they gathered together to protest.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnies in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"since aeons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia, mainly Christian High countries, in politics and economy, while they are the Oromos exploded, many Muslims are living and living in lowlands."</seg>
<seg id="37">But even this is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to coordinate with a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests were held in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have dominated the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated unfair by members of the ethnic group of the tigray, which are about 6 percent of the population and that are dominant in the military service, in trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebellion leader, was until his death on an unpublik disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was viewed as a tactical genius, a man who could think of the corner."</seg>
<seg id="44">"analysts say that he was particularly distorted to perceive early signs of dissatisfaction and special subjects to handle opponents and make them detrimental."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime is lacking in this fundamental failure," says Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopia, new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected from relatively unboundless reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray Region of Northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analyst say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the trust of the tigray safety services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time, Ethiopia was born such a rebellion in 2005, after thousands against elections protested, according to the statements of analytic seemingly, and subsequently stolen by the government."</seg>
<seg id="51">"while the following razor were killed many protesters, even though it was less than in the last few months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts, Ethiopia guides for their visionary infrastructural planning, as the new Pendlerzug, as well as for their measurable progress in the poverty reduction."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this does not affect the intensification of the internal misery of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And she takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month of griffing protest in Gondar, a amharish city, by Tigray-run shops and the hate towards the Tigray in the social media is getting more and more."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analyst say that the protests the US and other Western allies put into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, even though they recently investigated that she has closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West wants to support democracy, he does not want to merge its allies in an already volatile area."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," "said Mr. Abdi," "is a very thin walk."</seg>

<seg id="9">"however, that of long-term lifestyle seems to be a patent recipe for a high age."</seg>

<seg id="20">"Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now studied 28 Greenland, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Spitsbergen, as co-catching from the depth of the North Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimeters."</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals we analyzed it with the carbon-14-method the lins of sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eyelids is already created before the birth of the sharks, which the proteins are later no longer renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a great deal of carbon-14 in the lineup.</seg>

<seg id="29">"that Greenland-shark only then got off again if they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">"now, the researchers have to assign an age to the length."</seg>
<seg id="31">"because of one of the animals with 392 centimeters, probably at the threshold of lovemaking standing and his age with 156 years was determined, let Grönnhy was obviously at least one half centuries of time."</seg>

<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals often runs on austerity."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they are later - and age slow.</seg>

<seg id="7">"they are successful there, the potentially a ransom ransom clearly higher than with private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying fast evolution of damage software," explains Malwarebytes-Chef Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "World." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most of the malwareprograms were still designed to send advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then discovered the perpetrators of the pressrelease software for itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">"first, Privatuser was the target, but the change to company attacking took place in the past months very frightening quickly."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once on the computer of a sacrifice, it looks specifically for unlong changed files such as Word-, Excel- or database files as well as to archives of pictures and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypted the Ransomware and deletes the originals sustainable.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the software presents the demands of the presets.</seg>
<seg id="15">"to get the files to get the files, the victims of money - usually must be covered in the form of cryptowed bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but where with private users the personal photo database is on the game, it is about companies to sensitive customers or project databases without which the production is shut."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly higher the damage occurs, if a roansomware suggests."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of the German companies established sales losses caused by Ransomware, 13 percent even had to break the business activity completely, in case of a case people were in living."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany, several hospitals were victims of attacks, whose patients can be threatened by the loss of disease."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we say the victims still: pays not, it helps us only the problem," explains Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"however, 80 to 90 percent of firms you pay, their data get back again."</seg>

<seg id="25">"you explain their victims by chat, as they can pay by bitcoin, set free accessible support websites, or unencrypted example files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and are individuals after payments of a few hundred thousand Euros, companies must pay some harsh and five-digit sums have to redeem their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"given the potentially high and relatively risikolous gains from the Ransomware, the hacker are becoming more professional and share the work, explained safety experts Chester Wisniewski from the Antivirus-provider Sophos:" "a single person can write a Ransomware about within one week."</seg>
<seg id="28">"more likely, however, is that it is three or four people."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmer also sell their damage software in the form of a software building.</seg>

<seg id="8">"in this way, some - less potential than rather than on the multitude of desire areas, meant that the administration wanted to write the place."</seg>
<seg id="9">"sought out a administration of administration with a talent for languages and people, linked with a long-term experience in the field of social work, just a high-legend Wollmilchsau."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but administrative work is not its central area, the Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="11">"above all, it is about organization, work with the local people and also behind the scenes as well as mains."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been around for around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50-percent place on three years of temporary.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine customer, that Annika Deuschle honorary and full-official actors support. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are large and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">"soon, new container are available in the Wasstrasse"</seg>
<seg id="17">"there has been a serious problem for some time, which have been recognized for the connectors that have been recognized."</seg>
<seg id="18">For the connectors are the municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="19">You must accommodate refugees in their own or rented apartments.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the cost of construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must bear the municipalities themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from land-velvet to the Commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">"problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment."</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been designed for some time as very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto administration has no private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">"it has not been working so far, be dependent on private apartments, so Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, the common apartments must be evoked, as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so soon, new container will be placed in the Wasstrasse."</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a fixed lead, there are internships, training courses, schooling, a-euro jobs and progression for refugees and migrants that need to be found or established."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine customer. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the Bauhof or help housemasters, carry out-profit work - and the motivates and very tidy, like Annika Deuschle reports."</seg>
<seg id="33">They hopes that the work for the common and positive effect leads to a positive effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"that is" "no employment therapy." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity is not just work.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day will need a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so, there are offers such as sport, contacts with natives and especially Spanish courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are keygen.</seg>
<seg id="40">So you also jump to manage and honorary official.</seg>
<seg id="41">"it was central that the refugees get the feeling, they be desired in Germany and welcome."</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"you must declare the refugees that it will take, and it will be useful for them, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"who will eventually develop the feeling, he could no one could not work in Urbach nobody, thirsty and be unnütz, which will never be integrated."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"problem cases, however, there is also, says customer honest," people, in which nothing is going on. "the work of Deuschle and customer therefore always is to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">"this is all a" "mammoth task". ""</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: have the two according to recent occurrence fear of radicalisation, even in a small church like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," says Regine customer very clearly, "what some may be naive". "a balance-risk could possibly could and wool it."</seg>
<seg id="50">"sensitizing, the helpers were already."</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents were also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have fear that the attacks they complete fully in distortation.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with that," "says Regine customer."</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"so, the main and honorary time must hold on site and in the region according to activities."</seg>
<seg id="56">They have always in the background that soon a new shock could come to refugees and migrants to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a ceiling?</seg>
<seg id="58">That question is clear to answer the politics.</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to put them away from the spot."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we are not yet there, where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle. "</seg>
<seg id="61">"no new refugees, that would relax the location."</seg>
<seg id="62">"Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher have already asserted with it, the past people are reasonable."</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are currently around 100 people, mostly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in need, they need to help them are both women."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complex, there are no simple answers."</seg>
