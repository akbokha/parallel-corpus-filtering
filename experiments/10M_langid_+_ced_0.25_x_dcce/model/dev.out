Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and opp@@ ose Teheran &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing actions in the Middle East .
&quot; with the meeting , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ state solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is ten@@ se for years .
Washington un@@ cri@@ tici@@ zed the continuous sett@@ ling of Israel and casts Net@@ any@@ ahu lack of will at the peace process .
&quot; by the Obama &apos;s parliament , deal with the Iranian nuclear programme has deteri@@ or@@ ated the relationship of the two further deteri@@ or@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a contro@@ versi@@ al talk at the invitation of the Republi@@ can prior to the US Congress , which was lod@@ ged in some aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not speaking with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with regard to the upcoming election in Israel . &quot;
&quot; in a not@@ ing , Professor , his girlfriend have shot up &quot;
&quot; in a not@@ ation , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on was told with a somewhat mur@@ ky voice of the police , that he had shot his girlfriend and that officials would have to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; he was important to emph@@ asi@@ ze that its &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; but still live and probably excited , and he said , the fam@@ ily@@ acts of dead men could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; within the house , the officials found the bodies of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written notice : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted to do it , I loved Joseph and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; this was signed by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by God . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that he had travel@@ ed in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ veland , Mississi@@ ppi , some 300 miles to the school grounds , where he went home and killed by the police concerning his office . &quot;
Delta State University Pol@@ ishing ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that the staff members have heard about 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that he loved the fat@@ eful emergency call for some@@ time after that .
&quot; until the end of the day there was another death : lam@@ b took life , when the police officers up him . &quot;
&quot; one day after shooting at the university , the students and lec@@ tur@@ ers to hide themselves behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get an idea of what was motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the participants to the two ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped him to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teachers to draw . &quot;
students said that they were fre@@ amed on their teaching .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , he told no story of violence or criminal pre@@ history . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself was mentioned in a written book in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty are 17 members , and many students visited the courses of both . &quot;
at the same time there were some incl@@ inations to problematic behaviour .
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ avers , the Lamb , told , he seemed too little up@@ set and ed@@ gy as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that Lamb clearly told him that he had to do at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 with stress . &quot;
he had previously asked the Delta State University to have a vac@@ ations for health reasons and said that he have any health problem .
this year it was only two online courses .
&quot; recent changes in the employment policy of the university signi@@ fied that the promotion , for the Lamb , had worked so hard for him , no guarantee for the automatic way to an application as Assistant . &quot;
&quot; President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said , he know nothing of a conflict between represented and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs presentation . &quot;
these are questions I can no longer answer .
after the escape from the campus the police found Lam@@ bs Sp@@ ur when he returned to the Mississi@@ ppi from Ark@@ ansas .
&quot; before he could be arrested , mort@@ g@@ led himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house approximately a mile south of his parents home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississi@@ ppi , Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still going on in the entrance .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why lam@@ b went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
he grew up in the area .
&quot; he began his work at the University , the 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants , and taught Ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he gradu@@ ated in the spring in ped@@ agog@@ y .
&quot; like one of the many years of friends Lam@@ bs marked it as intelligent , char@@ is@@ matic and funny . &quot;
Carla H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through joint friends .
&quot; she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy , who tried several years to teach you the guitar lu@@ te . &quot;
at that time he was the women &apos;s black .
&quot; all girls dirty to then when he was there , &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson Vor@@ stadt of Brand@@ on dwell . &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said my wife &quot; &quot; I have killed my wife , but there was no judgment at a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house , which was adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police told that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , said , they were cr@@ ush@@ ed 15 years ago , but friends have stayed and a daughter who was now 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed in the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ St@@ een over his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; o &apos;@@ St@@ een said , he never met but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that he was interested in music and began blues . &quot;
he met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail three years ago appeared both on a Summer @-@ year market .
later they played together one or the other gig .
&quot; o &apos;@@ St@@ een said , his daughter writes and s@@ ings their own music . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nur@@ se living for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a Bar@@ ke@@ eper and sometimes Enter@@ pris@@ ed Co@@ ordin@@ ator at The Jul@@ ep Room , a weak@@ ened bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he &apos;s represented and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night 5th September , after he finished his guitar player and harmon@@ ious audience . &quot;
there were no signs of telling anything that un@@ anim@@ ate .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the au@@ cker and jok@@ er together .
&quot; I mean , they both had a good sense of jok@@ es . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt , the total Professor , hosted the first@@ semester seminar programme and specialized in American native and colonial history , Don All@@ an Mitchell , an English @-@ professor at the school . &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
he attended the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ansas and was President of his Br@@ other@@ hood and the Students Committee .
&quot; on the Delta State campus in Cle@@ veland , on Tuesday evening about 900 people , including lec@@ tur@@ ers , employees , students and members of the community at a cand@@ le cir@@ cus com@@ mem@@ oration . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ mid@@ ts Mrs Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt participated as well in the &quot; &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; &quot; and &quot; amazing grace . &quot; &quot;
the class will resume on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; said LA@@ FOR@@ GE . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .

&quot; Associ@@ ated Press writers Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans tru@@ ths to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been correc@@ ted , so in order to dis@@ gu@@ ise the police , after he had led the not@@ ation , and that lam@@ b was shot in his emergency , but there is no indication that the two have ever been married . &quot;

the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also distinguished for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the Roy@@ als , and I mer@@ it that the seat is next to me empty , and it will gradually me that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;

UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary General B@@ at K@@ i @-@ Moon says , his response to Russia &apos;s military support for Syria : &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; &quot; for almost five years of continuous conflict , and more weapons are wor@@ sen violence and mis@@ ery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN chief demands all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite to unite and support integr@@ ative negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member countries of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the end of the minist@@ erial meeting of the General Assembly in this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
&quot; he de@@ pl@@ ed that the divisions in the Council and the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; could make this situation un@@ sol@@ uble . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ an called on the five permanent members to show solidarity with the crisis in Syria to show the same solidarity and unity which showed it proven in achieving a nuclear confrontation with Iran . &quot;
8 Di@@ ets which show that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious to take .
some have tried to make him as a flop .
others have done him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans are trying to move Donald Tru@@ mp from the upper ranks in case of surveys , it did not work . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ dig@@ it area , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the od@@ ds of the nom@@ ination of the property Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
of course it is too soon in the leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ure .
no claims that Tru@@ mp are likely to win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphas@@ ise that at this time in 2011 R@@ ick Per@@ r@@ ys lead to the rising Herman C@@ ain , none of which did not have a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
there are many reasons why he would have in a general election .
&quot; but out@@ sider groups such as J@@ eb B@@ ush@@ s Super P@@ AC and the conservative committee Club for Growth now recognise tru@@ mp@@ s stamina and start to let their dollars flow to pl@@ unge it .
here are some recent changes that suggest that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l are not just a temporary phase :
Tru@@ mp@@ s popularity are around 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his candi@@ d@@ acy in mid June , showed a survey of Mon@@ mouth University , that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the estate @-@ Mo@@ gu@@ l . &quot;
until the middle of July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
&quot; now , six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view by Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
around three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures remain in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac @-@ voting in I@@ owa opened a last week that 60 percent of the re@@ public@@ ans have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ voters GO@@ P would be happy with Tru@@ mp &apos;s candidates .
&quot; in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the re@@ public@@ ans , they would be either &quot; &quot; thrilled &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; content &quot; &quot; if Tru@@ mp would be nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of 10 say they would be &quot; angry &quot; if he would be a candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm with Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; thrilled &quot; vs. 40 percent the same about Tru@@ mp &apos;s ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters want them &quot; &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , the candidate . &quot;
a majority of the Republi@@ can sees Tru@@ mp@@ s temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critic@@ ised for its bom@@ bas@@ tic and insul@@ ating statements , 52 percent of the re@@ public@@ ans ten@@ di@@ ous voters want the real temper@@ ament to a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number applies in the first temporary state of the nation , the federal state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the re@@ public@@ ans think he has the personality for a Ober@@ inf@@ op@@ y , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nonetheless , 44 percent think he did not have the personality to effectively carry out his position , and almost six of 10 independ@@ ents say his temper@@ ament does not pas@@ se to the White House , as ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
&quot; if they set up their funds , we hold the Tru@@ mp &apos;s Tru@@ mp for real . &quot;
&quot; if you are asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say according to a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C from the past week four of ten that Tru@@ mp is the best bet . &quot;
&quot; this is a change since the time , when four out of ten ran its money to J@@ eb Bush . &quot;
complete disclosure : GO@@ P @-@ voters in the past not the clear crystal ball .
&quot; at this point in the last cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans , that R@@ ick Perry would win the nom@@ ination to only 28 % for the final candidate of Rom@@ ney . &quot;
nevertheless it shows that a large number of GO@@ P @-@ voters is considered to be plau@@ sible .
&quot; even if the re@@ public@@ ans accum@@ ulated by another candidate , Tru@@ mp strikes almost every one . &quot;
&quot; some experts suggest that the sh@@ atter@@ ing field probably contributes to Tru@@ mp@@ s leadership , while the anti @-@ Tru@@ mp support is distributed to more than a do@@ zen other candidates . &quot;
&quot; but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September demonstrates that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp are beneficial . &quot;
&quot; in front of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points lead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before margin Paul , John Kas@@ I and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
there is a head @-@ an @-@ head @-@ race with Ted Cruz .
the only Candi@@ date on which he suggests ?
Ben Car@@ son would pick up the entrepreneurs with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ head race .
a g@@ onna majority of Donald @-@ Tru@@ mp &apos;s fans says that they have formed their minds .
&quot; a new survey of CB@@ S / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters want to support Tru@@ mp , they told their voices . &quot;
&quot; of course , it can happen to change that , and no one can really say to never change the mind . &quot;
46 percent said that they can leave the door open to other candidates .
&quot; nonetheless , Tru@@ mp@@ s is strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ sider , the neuro@@ surge@@ on Ben Car@@ son , but voters that they have formed their minds are twice as frequent for Tru@@ mp . &quot;
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp in the subject of immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tru@@ mp in his election campaign was released twelve months ago from Mexico &quot; &quot; r@@ ape &quot; , &quot; was the immigration and point of view in public dis@@ course . &quot;
&quot; some are worried that the bom@@ bas@@ tic out@@ lining of Tru@@ mp , His@@ p@@ ano @-@ Americans will be cor@@ rupted by the Republi@@ can party and damage the re@@ orientation efforts . &quot;
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post survey of Monday , six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp for questions of immigration . &quot;
&quot; so as long as the immigration in the spot@@ light remains , there is Donald Tru@@ mp seems to do too . &quot;
the fru@@ stration on the government cl@@ auses on new levels .
&quot; at Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son , now ent@@ ails around half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , particularly by their out@@ sider status . &quot;
&quot; six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider for someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry in Washington .
&quot; a survey of D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Bloom@@ berg in I@@ owa , two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa @-@ Repub@@ lic@@ ans may be frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ can in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; un@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five exclusive living parts of Germany &quot;
here in the K@@ ook@@ en@@ weg is the most expensive residence - with a view over the North @-@ waves .
in the street it costs a square meter of a reduction in the cut 73.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; on Sy@@ lt the offer to objects of natural is limited , so it is in the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which special lies a square meter at most costs .
&quot; of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really a little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top living places , one of the price depends on the Pe@@ anu@@ ts . &quot;
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ l has released a list of exclusive German residential places - with square met@@ ry prices in se@@ amounts heights .
&quot; there are several ten thousand Euros , - per square meter , comfortable . &quot;
but good who can afford it ...
&quot; by the way : Munich is located here , not at the head . &quot;
Champions League : Bavaria @-@ Dream@@ start thanks to Müller and G@@ oth@@ es
bil@@ low@@ ed Tor@@ sch@@ ütze in Pi@@ re@@ aus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has simply a run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller to the FC Bayern taking the way to a earned 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pi@@ re@@ aus - then ran &apos; s .
a sou@@ l@@ esi@@ ed pr@@ el@@ ude of the Champions League @-@ season .
&quot; the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario God@@ des have moved to FC Bayern in the Hex@@ enk@@ arm@@ chair of Pi@@ ra@@ eus a dream start in the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the crew of Trainer PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their bed@@ c@@ acle in the Champions League at the Greek Records Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot@@ ter atmosphere thanks to Mü@@ ll@@ ers double pack ( 52@@ th + 2 ) and Go@@ tz@@ es hit ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ f@@ th star@@ ters in line will be the first step towards the fin@@ als on May 28 , 2016 in Italy where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola in the third step will finally take the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich . &quot;
Müller on his 28@@ th hits in the Champions League led to Bavaria &apos;s guidance on the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ treas@@ Roberto which claimed to pass a j@@ unk shot of the world &apos;s fighters .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate they , had promised Bavaria @-@ Kap@@ am@@ ont Philipp Lah@@ m before the game in Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 688 hot@@ red fans - and the Mün@@ ch@@ ner kept word . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated performance without shine .
&quot; Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his most recent six home games in the Royal class , including well @-@ known clubs as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
2011 competitions here also Bor@@ ussia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; but the Bavaria , in seven European countries , un@@ conqu@@ ered with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
they went bra@@ ve ran in their offen@@ sive efforts but often to sol@@ u@@ ally to work .
the attacks were often attacked by shi@@ fting to Lin@@ ks@@ y Dou@@ glas Costa who was rare against the former Bra@@ un@@ ger Om@@ ar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck on the right side than its flan@@ k from the right half @-@ half in the left edge of the p@@ eck .
in the 67@@ th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
&quot; first , as the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ St@@ ür@@ mer ide@@ ye Brown the head ball of Poland struck by the line ( 26 ) . &quot;
&quot; then by Direct , the go@@ alie Roberto with the knee par@@ ked ( 35@@ . ) . &quot;
&quot; although Bavaria visited her usual game , he could put ra@@ ve nuts . &quot;
on door@@ ke@@ e@@ er Manuel Neu@@ er however was Lost .
&quot; as about , as he had a shot of ide@@ ye on the Lat@@ te l@@ enk@@ ins ( 56@@ th ) . &quot;
&quot; recently , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola left a quad@@ rup@@ ette with David Al@@ aba in the center of Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ closely , which made it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario God@@ ze , according to mus@@ cular problems back in the cad@@ res , sitting at first outside . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ WC hero was only given after the final training in the green light , she said Sport@@ front Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to make something different from it , that &apos;s already vi@@ ci@@ ous . &quot;
even at the first change Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought K@@ ings@@ ley Com@@ an for the newly renovated Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) .
&quot; godd@@ ess came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 76@@ th ) , and made 13 minutes later everything clear , by Iv@@ feet , Müller still set up a third . &quot;
in front of the game it was reached in the stadium of Kra@@ v@@ alle .
&quot; after a smaller group of partly uni@@ fied Bayern fans in their audience @-@ block , apparently the supporters of hosts Pir@@ at@@ ra@@ eus with words and gest@@ ures had prov@@ oked , attacked the security forces and went with per@@ tri@@ angles against the Mün@@ ch@@ ner trailer . &quot;
at least a Bayern fan has been bre@@ ached out of the stadium .
&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth &quot;
&quot; who smo@@ kes , so not just the lungs , but also the teeth - that puts a pot@@ s@@ dam@@ er long@@ term study . &quot;
good news : the risk decre@@ ases the risk quickly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly higher risk to lose their teeth .
&quot; this goes from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees by the German Institute of Nutrition Information ( DI@@ F@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smoking , there was a risk of losing their teeth , to lose their teeth in pre@@ matur@@ ely , in order to gain the 2,5@@ - up to 3.7 @-@ fold . &quot;
the researchers had observed more than 23@@ 300 participants .
&quot; vulner@@ abilities for dental loss , c@@ aries and infl@@ amm@@ ation of the g@@ um , stres@@ ses the DI@@ RE@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for this peri@@ odon@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ izing the authors . &quot;
the connection between smoking and tooth loss is therefore going back for frequent cur@@ at@@ ories of smo@@ kers .
&quot; whether smoking is not dec@@ ei@@ ved , smoking also raises the risk of dental c@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; people who have stopped using smoking , but could reduce their risk within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of D@@ ental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it might take over ten years until the haz@@ ard again drop to the level of non @-@ en@@ gen@@ cies , &quot; Mr Diet@@ rich from the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; they could per@@ su@@ ade people of it , non @-@ smo@@ kers , declared senior manager H@@ einer Boeing of DI@@ AM@@ E : &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the life time . &quot;
not to smoke is good for lung and vessels and leads to our findings also to a good dentist as far as the high age .
&quot; in Germany , over 20 percent of the population affected by the age of 65 to 74 years of dental violence , the DI@@ E@@ E divided . &quot;
earlier studies have already been advised that smoking is the risk of an early dental loss .
the new long @-@ term study are under@@ going the findings .

&quot; the contro@@ versi@@ al private hel@@ per@@ ation institutions for disputes between corporations and states are to be dis@@ solved by a transparent system , which in its way it works clearly more traditional dishes . &quot;
&quot; we want a system to set up the citizens &quot; , &quot; explained the competent EU Commissioner Cec@@ ilia Malm@@ strö@@ m in performance . &quot;
the sul@@ ph@@ ine also put forward the proposal as European negoti@@ ating positions in the US for free trade with the US .
the German government announced their support .
&quot; TTIP poses the world &apos;s largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings cont@@ ex@@ ert that the EU states and the USA have an independent judges for a new investment court . &quot;
they are intended to come from the EU and to third countries .
for the first time a second instance is planned .
it would allow it to raise against the jud@@ gement .
&quot; up to date , the process involved began with each other on refer@@ ee , an in@@ consistency against their jud@@ g@@ ments , there was not . &quot;
&quot; in the discussion of last months , be clearly that citizens of the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fair@@ ness and justice does not trust , commented on Malm@@ strö@@ m . &quot;
in the long term she wants to work according to an international investment court according to an international investment court .
&quot; there , for example , there could be clari@@ fied between Chinese companies and the EU states . &quot;
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration mainly to the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration tri@@ umph@@ s ( IS@@ DS ) are considered one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration will be cri@@ tici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parall@@ el@@ bow , through the companies to put claims of tax@@ pay@@ ers , national laws and reduce the reduction of consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in first statements , Anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ act signed the proposals of the EU Commission as in@@ sufficient . &quot;
&quot; cri@@ tici@@ zed , primarily , that they are not intended to apply for the free trade agreements with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) . &quot;
the German economic state sec@@ retary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) describes the plans for the contrast as big progress .
&quot; the Commission considered the reform essential points , the federal ministers of Sig@@ mar Gabriel in the spring with other EU @-@ trade ministers worked out . &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als be from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ strö@@ m .
the European Business Association B@@ usiness@@ Europe war@@ ned that to limit the economy to the economy by too many new rules .
especially small and medium enterprises could be dis@@ advantaged in this way it was called .
&quot; when the talks on TTIP vs ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be completed on Wednesday , continued to be un@@ clear . &quot;
the negotiations have been running since the middle of 2013 .
&quot; so far , the issue of Invest@@ ors of Invest@@ ors has not been discussed with the United States . &quot;
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is considered to be un@@ sustainable .

Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ ns Deb@@ ut at the Call of the Prime Minister
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Deb@@ ut is expected by the prime minister of the Prime Minister with tension
the new Labour President Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ n shall give his debut in the prime minister of the Prime Minister and to settle for the first time with David Cameron .
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise up to noon in order to take the first of his six pre@@ compiled questions shortly after lunch , generating its performance by the media and the Labour MEPs . &quot;
he called &quot; less theat@@ res and more facts &quot; at this week &apos;s weekly event .
&quot; he also said that he could ski@@ p some meetings , to leave them colleagues . &quot;
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns leadership , for it comes after his appointment as a member of the Sch@@ atten@@ kab@@ in@@ etes and after his speech at the TU@@ C F@@ airs on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the decision of the Labour Party , on Tuesday during the vote of the National Sp@@ hy@@ mn at a mem@@ oration of the 7@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain was prov@@ ok@@ es in silence , critic@@ ised by a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs , and is at the center of several cover @-@ stories in the newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision , not to sing the national anth@@ ems , has attracted attention . &quot;
&quot; a spok@@ es@@ person by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said , &quot; he said &quot; &quot; in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; Hel@@ dent@@ um of the Royal Air Force in the air @-@ eight um England . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ atten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he gave to the Labour leader , the national hy@@ si@@ est to sing , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the mon@@ archy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; many a do@@ zen of sh@@ adows ministers have been ref@@ used to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , and they refer to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a six @-@ six@@ ties of the parliamentary party it was supported as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences also can be st@@ acking within labour &quot; and by Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns expres@@ sions on the role of the European Union and the limit in winn@@ ings . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C @-@ Conference to put the Labour changes in order to remove the whole idea of a limit total .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ work and pensions Ministers said that the Party &quot; very clear &quot; is that they only be reduced to the government plans to reduce the limitation of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron , since he is T@@ ory leader , in the last decade of across the Dis@@ patch Box . &quot;
&quot; the Labour director , which promised a different policy att@@ achment that he said &quot; &quot; Cro@@ w@@ d @-@ Rest@@ ed &quot; &quot; ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; the Isl@@ ington North MP said that the prime minister of the Prime Minister has led to confront@@ ational , and that he is going down both &quot; &quot; shut@@ down &quot; &quot; and that he is going on serious problems like poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle is represented in the shadow of the Minister minister he does not participate - for example if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
&quot; he also brought the idea to conversation that other colleagues occasionally brought the word , and that he said John Ber@@ cow , the spok@@ es@@ person of the house , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; as he was leaders in 2005 , Mr Cameron wants to remove himself about the policy in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le @-@ theatre &quot; who often sp@@ rang up with the ques@@ tionnaires of the Prime Minister . but a few years later he sp@@ inning in it . &quot;
&quot; since she was first sent in television first in 1990 , the ques@@ tionn@@ aire was seen with the Prime Minister as the main bar@@ ometer of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position under his parliament , although critics have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and re@@ affir@@ med far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

&quot; the pound could show off @-@ nicely according to data , which show an increase in wage growth of the United Kingdom . parallel with the FT@@ SE was increased 100 through the cer@@ vi@@ cal goal of SA@@ BM@@ iller . &quot;
between May and July the earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew 2.9 % compared to the same previous year period .
&quot; this percentage has been the fastest , and performed in@@ estim@@ ations over the time of an ins@@ inn@@ au@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the Po@@ unds rose by more than 1 % compared to the dollar at $ 1,@@ 55@@ 05 and was up to 0,@@ 84 % compared to the euro on 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € . &quot;
the FT@@ SE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % on 6.@@ 229@@ ,@@ 21 .
&quot; SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a di@@ p of 20 % , after taking over @-@ offering of the ri@@ vals AB In@@ Be@@ v . &quot;
&quot; a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies of the world and combine brands like bud@@ wis@@ er , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;

PE@@ GI@@ DA @-@ Plak@@ at brings qu@@ ests to the Kartoff@@ el@@ on@@ er idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?

inspired by the Sp@@ ru@@ ch &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a poster of the PE@@ GI@@ DA movement made Al@@ h@@ ay pot@@ ato and meat together on a sk@@ ew@@ arm .
on the idea he brought him a poster with a PE@@ GI@@ DA demonstration with the title &quot; potatoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; which he acci@@ dentally had seen on TV .
&quot; since then , in his shop he turns a barbecue which has been equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ h@@ ay . &quot;
the idea has now been in the pat@@ ent@@ ese office in Munich in the meantime .
&quot; there , it has been protected according to the authority of the authority as a manual @-@ pattern . &quot;
&quot; as much meat and as much potatoes of the sp@@ ears , Al@@ h@@ ay does not want to reveal . &quot;
&quot; only so much : &quot; it tastes together even better , &quot; he will find . &quot;
even at its customers the culinary international understanding is good .
Met@@ alle laun@@ ches date @-@ continuous campaign to fight al@@ di@@ - waste
Met@@ alle tries to protect Ig@@ A @-@ Fili@@ alen in front of an Al@@ di lodge in South Australia and Western Australia .
&quot; food wholes@@ al@@ ers Met@@ enn@@ ers has launched a Boden@@ stand campaign to defend the market share of Ig@@ A retail@@ er in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion . &quot;
&quot; during Al@@ di the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia was prepared start the next year , we strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build the Ig@@ A through Ma@@ instre@@ am Marketing and marketing over social media , as well as events like Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ A @-@ dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands like iron blades S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough , distributed in Ig@@ A stores and shop owners , which sold tickets for the South Australian football stadium to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ alle deals with further details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ al@@ ers for food , alcohol and devices continues to achieve its annual investors strategy . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot on the game , since South Australia and Western Australia nearly 30 percent of Met@@ cas@@ hs Ig@@ A shop@@ pers will generate and generate higher profits than a met@@ cas@@ ian Ig@@ A network in the East states . &quot;
&quot; purch@@ aser in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provin@@ cial and Ig@@ A retailers come across a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia in comparison to about 14 percent in Eastern states . &quot;
&quot; however , analy@@ sts such as Morgan Stan@@ ley that Al@@ di &apos;s twelve months after opening its first markets around five percent of the food market in these two states will cut away and all the existing actors , but mostly self @-@ sized retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley , Ig@@ A @-@ retail@@ er 360 $ million sales per year and Met@@ cash will lose EUR 250 million to the end of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the progn@@ osis is based on the acceptance that Al@@ di will be launched in SA and 30 in WA next year , and generates sales of 500 million $ and 600 million in each market . &quot;
&quot; the loss in food and food business and in the quantities of met@@ cas@@ hs high fixed @-@ based meals could cost Met@@ enn@@ as approximately 13 million dollars of interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time Met@@ z market shares in the Eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ ours , though a recently inter@@ guided survey of Ro@@ y Morgan found that Ig@@ A @-@ Only are the most faithful . &quot;
&quot; Morgan Stan@@ ley cap@@ es that Met@@ cas@@ hs turnover in food and food store by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.4 percent in 2017 and 2.4 percent in 2015 will be reduced to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; last week told the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , at a business meeting in Melbourne that Met@@ alle will probably disappear inside a decade . Met@@ alle will disappear . &quot;
kis@@ sed off the comments from Mr Dou@@ glass to respond publicly to the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a manager of Met@@ ro has been made contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; IG@@ As market share has decl@@ ined since 2010 by 18 percent to 14 percent , and income from Met@@ cas@@ hs food manufacturing and food trade , which is about 1,@@ 200 Ig@@ A retail@@ er , has been led by 43 percent since 2012 , which is reflected in its operative pressure on revenues and mar@@ gins . &quot;
&quot; the wholes@@ aler f@@ ells out , however , and invested more than $ 150 million to return sale with Col@@ ors and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths by hundreds of products to improve the same and Ig@@ A retailers in improving their shops through rapid growing fresh food and to deliver better choice of private @-@ label foods . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ cas@@ hs captain &apos;s rid@@ or leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that the pri@@ cing and shop programmes are to be put to an alert and hopes that the wholesale distributor will return for the first time in the year 2017 for the first time in four years . &quot;
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by President of the Australian tennis courts Steve He@@ aly .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves more praise than criticism for its behaviour .
&quot; Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ater@@ al@@ damage &quot; in the recent storm , round about his friend Nick Ant@@ gi@@ os and deserves to view the President of the Australian tennis club Steve He@@ aly rather praise as criticism for his own behaviour . &quot;
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of talented Du@@ os that is always called &quot; &quot; Special K@@ s &quot; , &quot; gr@@ ated with St@@ an W@@ aw@@ rin@@ ka with St@@ an W@@ aw@@ rin@@ ka by the Montreal Masters in the spot@@ light . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y qualification in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after Kok@@ o Har@@ rison , and his opponent Ry@@ an Har@@ rison twice had to be separated by the refer@@ ee : &quot; W@@ aw@@ rin@@ ka would have to beat Ant@@ arc@@ os , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was recently seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis rack@@ et after a Cr@@ amp@@ f win a potential US Open @-@ Open @-@ victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teenage girl is currently in Glas@@ gow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth around the second place in the single of Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup P@@ fin@@ als against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one thing about which I &apos;m quite rock@@ ing , the fact that after my view Than@@ asi was drawn a little in the argument , &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; he has broken out a bat as he lost because of a Kr@@ amp@@ ian in the US Open , but he is not the first player who broke out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Than@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , it really beh@@ ave in the US Open very well , even among the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison , and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around , he has a great family around you , and I believe that he was treated as a little bit rig@@ or@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; he is a very rich 19 @-@ year @-@ years old , he works very hard and he has never worked out with the other players , he gets ok , he is good in form , he is a very stur@@ dy and mature young guy , and I believe he deserves to be judged by his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision , Kyr@@ gi@@ os not to take into account the important decision @-@ decision that begins on Friday and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right for everyone , but he saves the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term fixed part of the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition , and not all the contro@@ versi@@ al around &#91; Kyr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; and I believe that Nick was done very fast to as@@ cen@@ sion of guys like Feder@@ er and Murray . he goes into the eyes of the public , but we try to support him , and we try to assist him to understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the r@@ amp , in which he can only think about it , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s best for him . &quot;

chaos followed the border as hundreds of migrants had accum@@ ulated in a no @-@ man &apos;s land and ser@@ p@@ an official with rebel@@ lion .
&quot; the people who were fled from violence , encouraged for a unknown time in a land@@ mark on the road between the two check@@ points of the countries and built and settled there . &quot;

some statements made of protest food and water .
&quot; said Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister , it is &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants would withdraw from Hungary while more and more from Macedonia and Greece . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ater@@ al harm .
&quot; it must take place in the coming days of talks with Brussels and other countries , &quot; I@@ vi@@ ca Dac@@ ic said in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the hung@@ arian @-@ Ser@@ b border came one day after the 28 @-@ nations @-@ blo@@ c with a str@@ ingent meeting in Brussels could not agree with a policy @-@ immigration policy in Brussels .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people who were referred to in the shr@@ inking Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that finally - the next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would be agreed that the EU states would be more 120.@@ 000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; Hungary , however , continued its hopes for an open action between Brussels or his neighbors . &quot;
&quot; the emergency unit in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to get out of the crisis , so they could accelerate streets and accelerate asylum . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said , that his country also led to the construction of a sti@@ pul@@ ch@@ led count along its border with Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the land - after it has ended a fence at the Ser@@ b border . &quot;
&quot; CB@@ S News @-@ correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even pris@@ als , in the competition , the st@@ ach@@ el @-@ fence between Hungary and Serbia were used . &quot;
&quot; over the past few months , Hungary has become a significant increase in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban had insi@@ sted that most of the coming economic migrants are , who are looking for a better life , and not con@@ vul@@ g@@ ages , who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly contrary to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which occurred to midnight in Hungary in force , making the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high Za@@ us who caused the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also place higher ar@@ sti@@ ces for condem@@ ned human tra@@ ff@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the not@@ ation , &quot; said government speaker z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs repor@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eged . &quot;
we say it very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree with the use of the military , which is expected for next week , but repor@@ ters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen difficult soldiers with vehicles and dogs already tag@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ org@@ y Bak@@ on@@ di , country &apos;s safety advis@@ ors for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people at the attempt to cross the border , 15 others have already penet@@ rated deeper into the land . &quot;
&quot; they come about by sending the fence , they are now in police and are acc@@ used of pen@@ alties according to the new laws . &quot;
authorities have to be rep@@ aired the fence rapidly .
&quot; Hungarian officials united on Tuesday morning also two of the seven border arrangements with Serbia , after a draw@@ to@@ gon shed with stones used to close the limits . &quot;
&quot; chaos rever@@ ting the main border crossing , near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hungary opened a small office in a metal containers in order to edit the data of people and to supp@@ ress a crowd , to push themselves up there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 to come , but thousands stayed outside . &quot;
&quot; another group of migrants has blocked the main motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they may refuse food and water , until they may travel to Hungary . &quot;
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clin@@ tons &apos;s head@@ start before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
&quot; the former State Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton remains a double @-@ dig@@ it start in the democratic race at the national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins its opposite to the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has now the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the elections ( 58 percent earlier ) , while S@@ anders is in second place , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet been announced for the post office , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the elections . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say it too early is to say that their opinion will be determined which candidates will support them . &quot;
but Clin@@ ics supporters are certified in their election as those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the CB@@ S @-@ News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups , while S@@ anders achieved some gains . &quot;
&quot; Clinton considers a big advantage in women and comfort , but this pre @-@ spr@@ inkl@@ ing have reduced itself . &quot;
&quot; their support in the men is significantly dropped , and S@@ anders is only with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ ics benefit from democratic voters under the age of 50 has become vol@@ atile , and they are now on equal height . &quot;
anyway Clinton has a big head start with the older voters .
&quot; last month Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with two dig@@ its head start in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
&quot; about half of the democratic voters of the elections are nation@@ wide say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm , if they would be nominated by the Party . &quot;
&quot; a quarter would support them with some inci@@ dents , and another 15 percent would only support them because they &apos;re the nomin@@ ee . &quot;
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ ics are current back@@ ers especially enthusiastic about it .
&quot; the views are stronger at those who are currently not supporting Clinton - just about a quarter would love her . &quot;
&quot; whereas 48 percent of the democratic voters of the elections say they support Clinton with enthusiasm , say less of Republi@@ can voters by Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clin@@ ics supporters are asked in an open question why they want the candi@@ d@@ atin , is the most common response that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the opinion that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candi@@ d@@ atin for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; of Clin@@ ics supporters , also its association with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) mentioned . &quot;
consent to the handling of problems and elect@@ or@@ us@@ ability are also being c@@ ited .
&quot; as the Vice President , as the Vice President raises an potential for the presidential campaign , to see 57 percent of the democratic voters in the race - although a third believes that he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; when democratic voters are asked to be asked for the party who would choose their second election , be@@ ers is at the top . &quot;
&quot; by Clin@@ tons tags , more than half that bi@@ ds would be their second choice far ahead of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; decide to run Bi@@ den , not for the nom@@ ination of the Democratic Party , Hill@@ ary Clin@@ tons lead in front of S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in the race on 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best opportunities to win the election , but this number of 78 percent lower in the last month . &quot;
&quot; bi@@ den is by far a second with this measurement , but the percentage of which one sees it as the &quot; &quot; select@@ able &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , on the question of what is more important when a Candi@@ date is important , democratic voters call questions about elect@@ or@@ us@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; similarly as last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for this vote have emerged as unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates bring good results in some important characteristics of voters in their party elections .
&quot; maj@@ orities see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trusted and equipped with strong managers . &quot;
bid@@ ding cuts the three candidates most at the best of hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ ics strength is the leadership . &quot;
&quot; thirty per cent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not agree with him . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters of the presidential in general also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ological in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; for all of these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters do not see any opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; as questions concerning Hill@@ ary Clin@@ tons &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server during the term as an Secretary of State , most of the Democratic voters are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions did not influence their opinions . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public overall .
&quot; now , half of the Americans now is un@@ happy with their explanation , while only a third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion was in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the email contro@@ vers@@ y had no effect on their general opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion of her still worse . &quot;
&quot; there are mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of 10 , saying that their views of Clinton have become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is considered to be honest and trust@@ worthy , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trusted , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since may . &quot;
62 percent of the voting rights they do not keep them for an honest and trusted person .
at the same time 55 percent of the elect@@ or@@ ate nation@@ als are far from Tru@@ mp than not honest and not trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tru@@ mp are however received good banknotes by leadership .
&quot; of the six finished candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best in hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority sees S@@ anders rather than honest , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him . &quot;
&quot; the error rates of the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the pres@@ election is 6 percentage points , respectively . &quot;
Ben Car@@ son approaches the national political survey next to Donald Tru@@ mp
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest pol@@ l of CB@@ S News / New York Times closely behind Donald Tru@@ mp
&quot; the two candidates dis@@ appears half of the support of voters in the new survey , and others will lose dramatically at hold . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tru@@ mp in large numbers . the support is growing by 23 % in the last CB@@ S survey that was conducted in front of Fox News debate last month to 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son sh@@ oss in the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son meets demo@@ graphic groups well arri@@ vals and Tru@@ mp among Republi@@ can voters with university education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ govern@@ or John Kas@@ ich , is struck with the knowledge of the Govern@@ or Scott Walker , who is deeply liked by 10 % support last month at now 2 % . &quot;
the former Florida govern@@ or J@@ eb Bush , the former govern@@ or of Ark@@ ansas Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida @-@ Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are located at 6 % on the third place . &quot;
the troub@@ les@@ hooting at the sample of 376 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was released last week , shows that Car@@ son has entered into the envel@@ ope - he land@@ ed at 19 % support in the re@@ public@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support . &quot;
the most recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tru@@ mp well before Car@@ son .
&quot; overlooking one in the last week Tru@@ mp took place Tru@@ mp for the former neuro@@ surge@@ on , even after Car@@ son thought it ap@@ ologi@@ zed to ask Tru@@ mp@@ s faith . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp last Saturday during a campaign in I@@ owa . &quot;

five members of the Br@@ other@@ hood with the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ ings stra@@ ins
&quot; nearly two years , after a student occurred during a long @-@ channel ritual in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , will be filed against five people . &quot;
&quot; members of New York &apos;s Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Br@@ other@@ hood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory period during September 2013 , he held his transport to the hospital , which has contributed to his death , shared the police . &quot;
&quot; said officials , he had been loaded with connected eyes with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack of sand , and repe@@ aled , while he tried to go over a frozen field to a goal . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally came after head@@ aches , then it fell un@@ conscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Br@@ other@@ hood was not called the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ less and wa@@ ited an hour before they brought him into a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had time to switch to D@@ eng@@ s clothes , his symptoms to hand@@ lers and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national president of the Br@@ other@@ hood , to get advice , said Poli@@ wei@@ ef Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at that point , the members of U@@ ten@@ si@@ lien began to hide and placed the good of the Br@@ other@@ hood basically about the &quot; Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ ti@@ ef Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not revi@@ ved , and he died next morning at his inj@@ uries . &quot;
&quot; after an Aut@@ op@@ sev@@ enty @-@ seventh , Den@@ g repeated with st@@ ump@@ ant power inj@@ uries at the head , tor@@ so and thig@@ hs . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the barriers of the Br@@ other@@ hood . at least a student died since 1970 every year , at the Sch@@ ik@@ anen , an attor@@ ney , the D@@ eng@@ s family represents , in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe received an indic@@ t@@ ment due to the third grade for the first five members .
&quot; two @-@ thir@@ ties members of the Br@@ other@@ hood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged for schi@@ vi@@ ci@@ ous attacks and formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t just want to make responsible for the involved persons , but if there is an organization that - officially or in@@ official - so we will also hold this to account , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Bar@@ uch College has b@@ anned the Br@@ other@@ hood , and the national other@@ hood did re@@ vo@@ ke their membership to the town . &quot;
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; inser@@ ts comes , and the domestic will get into the wol@@ ves , ren@@ dering for bonds and the economy will put into a recession . &quot;
we know that .
what we do not know is how long that will last and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history for the economy offers only low instructions for the process . &quot;
a recession came within only 11 months after the first interest rate and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggression of the Federal Reserve at raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in doing such as the economy and the financial investments . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have emphas@@ ized that investors should not focus on it , when it starts to increase the interest rates , but rather over the period , which is needed for standardi@@ zation . &quot;
in fact multiple variables perform a role .
&quot; at the end , market participants will see however , that the whole excitement about a inser@@ tion may be exag@@ ger@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the initial increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is inev@@ it@@ ably interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money &quot; , &quot; said Julian Cur@@ op , Chief Compliance at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we expect not to return the gradu@@ al return of the U.S. interest rates to normal heights , but still at low levels , to lead to sei@@ sm@@ ic shock , which seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effect . &quot;
here is a focus on historical trends such as some areas of the economy could react :
&quot; seen as the market last month , the anticip@@ ation of tick @-@ parts can do things for a while vol@@ ati@@ l . &quot;
&quot; once the increase in , the influence is not as dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that investments absor@@ b from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , what may once again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analy@@ sts in a newer study , what happened after inser@@ tions of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; in the past 35 years , the market is mostly low in the warming - about 14 per cent - on the road to cement levels , quite flat in the 250 days ( average profit from 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis , the Bob Doll , head system Strateg@@ ic in Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , with Bar@@ ron &apos;s released . &quot;
&quot; the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares should occur later in the enlarged cycle , and the return begins to decrease . &quot;
&quot; rec@@ es@@ sions are a fact of economic life , but interests them often support them . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed was faced with some conditions that could not have existed before and speed up a recession . &quot;
extremely remarkable is that the gross domestic product is close to its lowest point in a inser@@ ting of the F@@ ed .
&quot; according to the Deutsche Bank saw the 118 of inser@@ ts since 1950 , it has been rated as € 4,5 percent . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.7 per cent , only few that this will last and expect for the third quarter of the Atlan@@ ta F@@ ed only 1.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ tions in such frag@@ ile economic back@@ drop might be ris@@ ky and throw the question , &quot; whether this time is different &quot; , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
market students have agreed all year round the f@@ emal@@ el@@ ance of the F@@ ed and all eyes were directed to the session of the Federal Open Market Committee this week which ends on Thursday .
&quot; while many Strateg@@ ic and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could increase an increase in this session , the F@@ ut@@ ures trade has only a chance of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study all enh@@ anc@@ ements of 1950 to present in a super @-@ cycle with increasing momentum during GDP took place and on @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ics , very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadow &quot; , &quot; said the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery of what the worst recession came in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest , which has maintained the F@@ ed since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are now 74 months . &quot;
&quot; the fixed income was also vol@@ atile , since the market is expanding an expansion of inser@@ tion , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
&quot; the main difference is that the effect at bonds are faster than when shares , if they change their strategic course . &quot;
&quot; in bonds , the ren@@ dering time seem to shift the direction as soon as the first raise / lo@@ wering into the cycle is performed . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the bail@@ out cycle , the bond forms immediately , the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
&quot; Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates will result in interest that ren@@ dering between longer and shorter bonds are closer together , and lead to a down@@ turn of the cur@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; recommended bonds often bring better income , although &quot; we are still careful , higher y@@ ields &quot; , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed Income Level for Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; interesting , Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed @-@ Strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation continued waiting , there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the profit@@ ability is flat@@ ter , len@@ ten@@ se increased and vol@@ atil@@ ity has risen - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed have exac@@ erb@@ ated its strategy . &quot;
&quot; throughout the large and whole business , businesses that will capit@@ alize greater part of their business operations in the US , if interest rates are growing and local products more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multination@@ als with high debts will be worse , as an increase in the dollar is making their products on the global market and as well as financing their debts . &quot;
&quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; shares should be extremely positive to react in three months after an initial tick @-@ power , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analy@@ sts in a report for the customers . &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have out@@ done companies with weak exam@@ inations in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 at an average of 5 percentage points . &quot;
&quot; companies with high capital ren@@ dering as well as low vol@@ atil@@ ity during their shares also over@@ met their counter@@ parts with low quality at average 4 ( percent@@ ages ) and 3 ( percent@@ points ) . &quot;
debts are a major problem .
&quot; companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates are most losing , Gold@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; out of pure share games , consumers will also benefit from the rising Dollar . &quot;
&quot; savings could see profits by higher y@@ ields , even if experts of different opinions are , as quickly this will take place . &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says parliament@@ member Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham &quot;
&quot; the conserv@@ atives member of the Parliament cri@@ tici@@ zed the transm@@ itter because of its &quot; cur@@ sion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
ar@@ gues that it is increasingly different from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also moved to the BBC Music Awards and said that she mim@@ im@@ itate only The Br@@ its mim@@ ics
&quot; co@@ ot Dam@@ ien Collin@@ s reached the mission of The Voice and said , that this is not very original . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; turned &quot; too Classic FM , maintains a leading companion and increased new pressure on the sender , prove that he does not do something that the private sender doesn &apos;t do . &quot;
&quot; the conserv@@ atives Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham said also to the BBC @-@ Bos@@ s , that the publicly @-@ law radi@@ os@@ en@@ al &quot; dum@@ b &quot; and is increasingly no longer different from its commercial competi@@ tor . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I use the word &quot; stup@@ id &quot; &quot; - but it seems to become Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot;
he also moved to the BBC Music Awards held in the last December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started in the past year seem to be The Br@@ its only under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples , in which you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market &quot; , &quot; said Mr B@@ ing@@ ham . &quot;
&quot; BBC @-@ Direc@@ tor@@ ator pointed the pro@@ dig@@ s back and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of his commercial competi@@ tor , when it comes to live music and clari@@ fication of the public . &quot;
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I will learn about classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 , find new music and to give new works in order , I also consider important , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year I argu@@ ed BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey that t@@ oug@@ her to get involved , when it did so in the past because the British are less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production that during the hearing in the Committee on the choice of culture , media and sports for this under fire , commercial ri@@ vals on the feet . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory @-@ MP Dam@@ ien Collin@@ s hold The Voice on - the musical talent show of the BBC , which was bought by Dutch producers Tal@@ pa Media for estimated costs of 22 million £ . &quot;
&quot; see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not especially distinctive ? &quot;
Lord Hall consi@@ sted that the BBC 1 @-@ Show - with Pal@@ oma Fa@@ ith and Boy George as a judge - &quot; produced on special BBC @-@ way . &quot;
&quot; he added , he wish that the company &quot; &quot; a hit out of our home &quot; &quot; find &quot; , &quot; if it is the next time a entertainment series . &quot;
&quot; however , he ref@@ used to include the order of further rows of The Voice in the Future or to spend money of the enco@@ ders for other sub @-@ based formats . &quot;
internet @-@ Sho@@ wers in August at the s@@ avi@@ est and Black Friday can be responsible for this
&quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent of sales in online sales . &quot;
last month there were the lowest result since the start of records in 2000
online sales increase three years ago by the use of Hand@@ ys to shop
experts believe that Black Friday in November has bra@@ ked the issues
&quot; for over a decade , the virtual shopping is geb@@ ra@@ om@@ t , and many of the major shopping streets of Britain have turned into mind . &quot;
&quot; however , experts say that there are now indications that the online con@@ ges@@ tions will be stag@@ gered according to new figures just seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 , with only five percent increase from the previous year . &quot;
experts say that there are signs that online sales will be stag@@ gered according to new figures just seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the years and go back to 2000 , then in the course of time it has evolved over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G &quot;
&quot; he explained that the online sales purchases three years ago strengthened , as a purch@@ aser , with their mobil@@ es purchases . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now , it is comm@@ utes that and we may possibly experience that growth is reduced . &quot;
&quot; the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon that was import@@ ed out of America , is being c@@ ited as a reason for the decre@@ asing turnover . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that buyers keep their purchases before this event , which will take place on last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers to make their computer to make their bar@@ gain , and some dealers stor@@ my . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , where the buyer could be avoided due to bar@@ gain , buyers to keep away . &quot;
a study of the British Ret@@ ail con@@ sortium found that over 5 spending gets a little more than 1 £ online .
&quot; with some products such as television and washing machines , more than one third of purchases can now be done on web shops . &quot;
at the same time im@@ bu@@ ys more than one quarter of the people clothes and shoes online instead of decor@@ ators in the interior cities .

&quot; today King Sal@@ man , the B@@ in @-@ Laden , said the arm of the Cran@@ e should not be ste@@ amed as he was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arabic version of the Sec@@ rets , published by the state of Saudi press Agency , said that the B@@ in @-@ Laden @-@ group was responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ speaking service of the news agency does not refer to this detail , but said that the leadership of the company does not be prohibited . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man tag@@ ged Sal@@ man to un@@ cover what the fall of the sick had condem@@ ned , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims took place in front of H@@ add@@ sch , which will take place later this month . &quot;
&quot; the B@@ in @-@ Laden @-@ group has issued no statements on the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for an opinion . &quot;

&quot; the crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before an arrival of millions in the kingdom for pilgrimage , which is required at least once in a life of every healthy life . &quot;
officials spoke that 158 people remain in the hospital .
governments adopted that 1 million finishes ( £ 174.@@ 000 ) to the relatives of the host@@ els are to be paid and the same amount of permanent aband@@ on@@ ment .

B &amp; Q Bos@@ s says that the time of cheap Eastern European crafts@@ men is about
&quot; British employ increasingly crafts@@ men , says Ver@@ onique Laur@@ y &quot;
the number of skilled crafts@@ men from Eastern Europe has a rise behind them
&quot; this leads to that 200 other scre@@ w@@ fix plates , which are aimed at crafts@@ men &quot;
at the same time King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q Shops will close too well
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chef @-@ repor@@ ter of the Daily Mail &quot;
&quot; it is argu@@ ed that British their H@@ unters and brushes in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European crafts@@ men , who carry out the works in their homes . &quot;
&quot; if you are sent to a hammer or a brush for the cont@@ end of walls , you are among them apparently toward a minority . &quot;
&quot; for British increasingly employ crafts@@ men to carry home jobs jobs in their homes , such as the head of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ér@@ onique Laur@@ y , new business manager of King@@ fis@@ her , who has the tree nur@@ tured chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe , providing services on low prices are now out@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; therefore , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 other scre@@ w@@ fix stores that are oriented to crafts@@ men and to conclude 60 outlets from B &amp; Q . &quot;
Mrs Laur@@ y said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops because eight out of ten purchase choices in the store are made by women .
at the moment the men weig@@ h the men .
&quot; she said , it is necessary to set up the growing demo@@ graphic trends which make more female single households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Laur@@ y said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we need to shift this stronger way into a balance .
&quot; basically , half of our customers from women with 80 percent of the decisions made by the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a big role in making the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Laur@@ y who is one of only five women at the top of a British in FT@@ SE@@ 100 index listed leading companies also has re@@ constructions her top team to reflect a equal number of men and women in management positions .
&quot; King@@ fis@@ her is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial departments . &quot;
Mrs Laur@@ y said : &quot; this was a deliber@@ ate decision - variety is here an important issue .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Super@@ visory Board .
&quot; King@@ fis@@ her en@@ umer@@ ated a decline in the half @-@ year period and the turnover , after the group costs the cost of l@@ apping the l@@ apping . &quot;

functional of A@@ i / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity before Court
at the Landes@@ gericht Kl@@ agen@@ furt have responded to the Wednesday of two function@@ aries of the Austrian Vol@@ ley@@ ball @-@ vice @-@ show A@@ I / D@@ if because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and back @-@ education .
the acc@@ used are not guilty .
one of them had been charged with the charges .
in May he has been veri@@ fied to be veri@@ fied in May .
the current process has been postpon@@ ed .
&quot; according to the Ober@@ sta@@ ats@@ acc@@ ede Robert Ri@@ ffel was formed out in the pre @-@ investigations that the def@@ endants in the years 2006 until 2011 funds were disp@@ uted by associations , about which they used in their functions , for private purposes . &quot;
the damages resulting from around 400@@ ,000 euros .
the sport @-@ functional are also indic@@ ted because of financial .
&quot; this factor was the president of the ver@@ on@@ en@@ sen@@ ator , Rich@@ der Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
&quot; the us@@ ation of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity put the defense , that the association was not a asset to any point in time . &quot;
&quot; the sport mul@@ titudes have been calculated only dis@@ compens@@ ated and the sport club , for whom they have been working from 1982 to 2011 and has invested a lot of time and money from debt - pas@@ siv@@ ated by pas@@ siv@@ ated in 2001 around 6@@ 00.@@ 000 Sch@@ illing ( rd . 44.@@ 000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time , we were facing the situation : do we continue to lock the Club or lock it ? &quot; , &quot; one of the acc@@ used , in the bread@@ cru@@ el of the Ministry of Finance . &quot;
he then decided to undertake this task with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants .
with all risks .
&quot; we have been making money prescribed , our life insurance for security in the bank , &quot; he said with the acceptance . &quot;
&quot; with the association was agreed : you can manage the money freely , it may not be made any debts . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in case of appropriate financial and success the pay@@ out of the compens@@ ations was determined retro@@ sp@@ ectively up to 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , you have been a part of the compensation damage only years later , namely from 2003 to as a plus in the account was paid . &quot;
&quot; therefore also l@@ ump sum and not details , explained the former shelter of the proceedings . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and sc@@ ars ch@@ ain@@ ted the two acc@@ used , said the second acc@@ used . &quot;
why the pay@@ outs of the association were not detailed in detail , the judges asked . &quot;
&quot; the association has not been interested in detail in the financial statement , important is just the freedom of school , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 against the lack of functioning investigations , due to the official inaugur@@ ation date , an amount of 120,000 Euros was transferred to the agreement . &quot;
&quot; the be back , said the acc@@ used . &quot;
&quot; this securities account ran forward on the name of the second acc@@ used , and was not known according to the association &apos;s statement . &quot;
&quot; why ? , &quot; wanted the right to know . &quot;
&quot; after that , the asked for a long time did not ask an answer . &quot;
&quot; then he said it finally , he believed that this is the best for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , nobody knew anything of this money , the prosec@@ ut@@ or presented in the room . &quot;
the competi@@ tor was informed would have been informed ; justi@@ fy himself of the function .
this transfer was form@@ ulated as &quot; &quot; claim &quot; . &quot; &quot;
why harm ? ? , we wanted to know right speech and prosec@@ ut@@ or . &quot;
&quot; after that the first acc@@ used he did not agree with this wor@@ ding , because the association had never taken a damage . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the law@@ yer says , &quot; &quot; with this you are all out of the h@@ ook . &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the functioning , he never used a cent sal@@ ary , he only charged mileage and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; di@@ ets has been charged with the association 1,000 euros per month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added . &quot;
accurate documents for the early years could not prove the def@@ endants .
&quot; these may be judged by an examination , in which everything has been judged correct , no longer has been kept . &quot;
Kilom@@ eters also had referred to the second acc@@ used .
&quot; all containers can be done in cash , from his residence international market to bank to the bank after Blei@@ burg , he declared it in his statement . &quot;
the main negoti@@ ation will be continued on September 23 with the survey of witnesses .

time of decision on interest rates for the U.S. emergency
&quot; the world ob@@ serves if the U.S. emer@@ al number on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , come together to meet the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists who were asked by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed is going to do this , now think that the F@@ ed is going to do something longer and the interest rates on the current state of 0 - 0,@@ 25 per cent will hold . &quot;
&quot; it is a historical event because it &apos;s seven years ago , since the F@@ ed interest on NU@@ LL . &quot;
&quot; for the first time we approach the situation , in which a great central bank may leaving the zero @-@ area and start a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ des , Leit@@ ner employees at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. economy is on a relatively good performance , tr@@ illion dollars will be added to the balance and generate just a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed can not ignore the less rough outlook on global circumstances . &quot;
&quot; she has war@@ ned the markets to an increase , but the signs suggest that the chances of such a step are good . &quot;
the decision should be announced at 8 : 00 CET on Thursday

he had no explanation for his shots .

Luke Grand w from Manchester United can &apos;t play mon@@ atel@@ ang because of double clim@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered from the Champions League &apos;s defeat from Manchester at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven a double Fra@@ ktur of his right leg .
&quot; while this brought about the left &apos;s left defense and close it for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al will not give up hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was st@@ acked in the PS@@ V areas .
he was treated nine minutes on the pitch and needed oxygen before he was brought to hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has doubled b@@ einf@@ ra@@ ture and is in the hospital . &quot;
he will be rep@@ aired tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then in Manchester .
&quot; it is terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it is very difficult and then fantastic again , and then it is happening . &quot;
in the lo@@ cker room he had an oxygen mas@@ ke .
he cri@@ ed .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have double frac@@ ture , then the six months , and he will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
&quot; Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy , a red card and the im@@ ign@@ ation of a few meters . &quot;
&quot; Nicol@@ a R@@ izz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has the Mex@@ ic@@ ans not pun@@ ished . &quot;
van Ga@@ al susp@@ ected that the Italian arbit@@ r@@ ator had mist@@ aken itself .
&quot; you can judge for yourself , if I say that a iv@@ ory and a red card can be sus@@ cep@@ tible . &quot;
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
&quot; a twe@@ et to Sha@@ ws account kept : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how cap@@ sul@@ ation I am , my way to recovery starts now , I get stronger again . &quot;
herein : Manchester United suffer the loss of Luke Sha@@ w with the defeat at PS@@ V
the UK def@@ ender has an additional incentive in France to recover from June to the coming June .
&quot; Philli@@ p Co@@ cu , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very horri@@ ble injury . &quot;
&quot; if a player leaves this type of injury to the place , all are very sad . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an enemy .
Mor@@ eno er@@ lit@@ t a leg @-@ break when Mexico was played against Van Ga@@ al The Netherlands in the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; he is very difficult , because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the enemy , and if you then hear that it is a very horri@@ ble injury , that is not good , &quot; said Co@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball that was on the way in another direction , so it looked like he had touched him , but I could not see attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; talking with SB@@ S@@ 6 said Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard to be anything . &quot;
I feel very bad for me . I am so sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ Player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken into hospital - after a oul@@ ting of Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is one thing that all parents learn soon : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost out . &quot;
&quot; unless you are David Cameron . &quot;
&quot; asked when he asked by a provider of child care systems , his favorite children &apos;s book decided to call the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , which was created by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a tough choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ camps , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , because it seems always a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to describe the plot of this book , instead , there is a sub@@ section of the film version of 2012 , the new characters and details added to expand the pretty short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the w@@ alled town of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , hopes to meet a boy named Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl from Au@@ dre@@ y , he reads their desire to make a real tree , whose rich@@ ly name Theod@@ or Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel was lau@@ ded and the 1991 died , but entirely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if that was not sus@@ pic@@ ious enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly reads like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , where everything is artificial and even the air a commodity is , hopes a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he adm@@ its to be a prag@@ matic Father , it seems unlikely to reject the action of this book so little . here &apos;s an un@@ named boy , like the local environment through the cas@@ h@@ eight@@ ed Lor@@ ax , a s@@ ore , cor@@ r@@ ush@@ ed being , &quot; that is referred to in the name of the trees &quot; , &quot; wo@@ unded . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR function was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per that won The Lor@@ ax not twenty times a child . &quot;
a Down@@ ing @-@ Street @-@ speech said that the text was probably come by Camer@@ ons of his circular office .
&quot; Super@@ camp@@ s confirmed that the text of Camer@@ ons staff was supplied , but there were no further immediate comments . &quot;
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team but it is still hard to find
&quot; to meet Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , is a difficult task , but if you have selected the cad@@ res to the England for the tour , a re@@ vis@@ ing of the 3 @-@ 0 test series is not on my card . &quot;
I would not exp@@ el an ou@@ ter@@ see man .
&quot; Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks side is possibly less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the Batt@@ ing installation , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear N@@ arb@@ ons of 2012 , only a youth@@ ful @-@ positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball developing Mo@@ een Ali as spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size at the test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
&quot; here@@ with @-@ related news : Adam Ly@@ th fail from the UK test cad@@ res , and will be replaced by Alex H@@ ales . &quot;
&quot; the decision , Adam Ly@@ th exp@@ ires , is of course to be analy@@ sed as his boss trainer in Yor@@ k@@ shire . &quot;
&quot; in his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions and the simple but hard reality is that man@@ ic players are gear@@ ed to results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and this led to the nom@@ ination , since - and I told this - players are their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; long ago it would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own destiny . &quot;
&quot; when he hopefully challenging new shopping for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance . &quot;
&quot; England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss sing his attitude , even if he did not put so good performances , and this was surprised me ; he is above all a team @-@ man . &quot;
&quot; the question , how much time a test , will receive its character , is difficult . &quot;
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton nine got .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to do home and play .
&quot; the only acc@@ us@@ ation that you can rise , was that England first put Jonathan dum@@ pl@@ ings in the Caribbean , but as Ly@@ th in Friends - but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot;
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he is a dru@@ id that I restri@@ ct up to .
&quot; he is a X @-@ factor @-@ Cri@@ quet player , which we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scor@@ ed 236 against us on a Tr@@ ento Bridge , which we met very . &quot;
&quot; he has to receive at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends of course on the team position in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to suggest Mo@@ een next to C@@ ook , which would yield a extra @-@ spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and get four qu@@ icks , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a dru@@ id can not strike there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a devil @-@ cake of cri@@ cket player . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een may not be done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but is he a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my former team @-@ mate J@@ ustin L@@ anger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he joined in 2001 as Open@@ er .
he made three hundred of us immediately and didn &apos;t look back .
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as Back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited approach to him , he made me very impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people possibly see their statistics , an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it is a hunt , but there is no large number of backup sounds who lift their hands and the trainers have decided for youth . &quot;
on this tour he will learn a lot .
&quot; apart from the team England has made a few smart supplements in the train@@ ee . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ den@@ e , the Bat@@ sman in Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game that will bring a wealth of experience , since he played amongst all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes to the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use in the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he is created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insight that we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the dres@@ sing decoration , even if the news is in line with the previously bl@@ ender . &quot;
&quot; Coll@@ ys team members at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ ok@@ es , is not used at the One Day@@ ton , R@@ oot was a similar break against Australia and I don &apos;t have a problem with it . &quot;
&quot; some may not agree , but co@@ aches and Team@@ ings do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you must think that like those players will hin@@ ge their jobs from their results .
such decisions are not made easy by the heart .

&quot; it may take but it needs to develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa has left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns official position on Europe is - I press it nice times - in development .

&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no B@@ enn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n in the radio and on television this week said , to admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns appointment of the prov@@ ok@@ ing John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as the shadow of a bad idea was . &quot;
&quot; it remin@@ ded me of the 70 @-@ er years , when his old father go@@ ed himself in television with his Labour to go far too far and lose his cab@@ inet@@ line job . &quot;
Hil@@ ari@@ y &apos;s fight was more attractive .
&quot; but to fight for &quot; to stay under all circumstances - B@@ enn@@ s said - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his fellow strikes and members after all reports on their jud@@ gement on the assembly evening . &quot;
&quot; whatever the tou@@ ching bottom line of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey in mind that he even stir@@ red me - News @-@ discipline remains essential in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the wh@@ irlpool of Social media , a bru@@ tal with par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it is correct to give Cameron no freedom card for Europe that allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the refer@@ en@@ al gra@@ fic for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell es . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks certainly so .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns major ambig@@ u@@ ities on EU membership - in accordance with its B@@ enn@@ ite Bel@@ lev@@ elling economy , its anti @-@ capit@@ alistic discussion - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left disp@@ arities of the small under@@ far@@ ism is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;

experts critic@@ ise the report of Public Health England via E @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; claims of a state financing agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 persons , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
experts who write in British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) by using the Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in her report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
p@@ he published the &quot; basic report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have ques@@ tioned the res@@ ili@@ ence of the data and directed to the connections between several experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; a editorial paper in the medical journal In@@ et last month has reached the &quot; extra@@ oral @-@ indic@@ ative foundation &quot; , &quot; on the p@@ he his most important conclusion . &quot;
&quot; two more researchers write to BM@@ J and have asked whether the claims &quot; &quot; on stone or sand &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tro@@ pic@@ al Medicine and Simon Cap@@ ony , Professor of Clinical Neuro@@ physiology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public expect the claim of p@@ he that , &quot; the present best estim@@ ation is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes is about 95 % less harmful as qu@@ itting smoking &quot; on a detailed review of follow @-@ up and model mod@@ elling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multi@@ disciplinary criteria ( Multi @-@ Criteria Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to lead her opinions about the damage caused by various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ hal@@ ogen products into a synthesis . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ ony said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose Managing Director previously was to have received by British American Tobacco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
&quot; he also signed the testim@@ onials of BA@@ T for Public Health in a Sustainability Report , told them . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants declared their meeting the means of an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the financing that he had received after reports earlier by Tab@@ ak@@ usa Philip Mor@@ ris International , added them . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums are not delivered , but includes several known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes , some of which also provide a sector financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the meeting also took part in the sp@@ inet of p@@ he .
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; blow@@ n evidence &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of hard evidence of the damages of most products in most criteria &quot; , &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; however , no of these links or limitations are discussed in the p@@ he report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ ef said , that there &apos;s no evidence that there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes has been a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smoking . &quot;
&quot; prof Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at p@@ he said that was responded to the alleg@@ ations of BM@@ J already previously . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ kers die of his ad@@ diction .
&quot; all evidence is close that health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes compared to that , but we continue to study the long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; p@@ he has the unique obligation to inform the public about what the evidence is occupied and what is not , especially if there are so much public confusion about relative danger related to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 8@@ 0,000 people die yearly from a disease with regard to smoking , and smoking costs the national health system two billion £ a year . &quot;
&quot; by clear declar@@ ations of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fr@@ action of harm which is caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; on BBC , East@@ En@@ ders give up , says former chief of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said , the BBC should stop , programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm , &quot; for hit shows how the Albert Square So@@ ap &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the broad@@ cast@@ ee should only be used to make the type of programs , which will not be sent by other UK channels . &quot;
&quot; he cri@@ tici@@ zed the BBC that it is probably seen publicly @-@ legal programmes , which probably will be seen by a smaller audience , in harsh contro@@ versi@@ al contem@@ pl@@ ating against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and from broad@@ cast@@ ers such as BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC @-@ General Director , Tony Hall , told the company to do more in partnership with other organisations , Johnson said that he was six years in his time at Channel 4 without success , to get in touch with the BBC in contact . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that the BBC Programme is sent or send , which would also clearly demonstrated by un@@ conventional ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson dem sky@@ scrap@@ er @-@ committee in the context of its investigation into the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broad@@ est fee , what I consider mid@@ - or long @-@ term does not stop for a good idea , you should do its production at least on programs , others do not make or order . &quot;
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class window because they want to achieve a broad range of support for their future .
&quot; the idea that else nobody would display this is a joke , it is ridi@@ cul@@ ous , it is natural non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive control programs financed , which could also be financed without subsi@@ dies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both peculi@@ arities . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm for it . &quot;
I judge me to see how it should be publicly on @-@ right television .
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC ever .
&quot; Johnson , a entrepreneurs for series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said that the BBC to blame for ratings may be &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of men who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular ship@@ ments of the BBC will give what the former head of Sky , Tony ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ g@@ art Conference in Edinburgh in 2003 proposed that the BBC shows like East@@ En@@ ders should sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ law N@@ ic programs &quot; go to BB@@ C4 , where you can &apos;t measure their duties , and they may be argu@@ ing if they have created their limits to justi@@ fication of 4 billion pounds , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all of these ob@@ sc@@ ams programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put it in a time window where no one they ever wanted to see .
&quot; at the broad@@ casting fee , Johnson said to the Committee : &quot; I urge you to find a rather ra@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value here . &quot;
&quot; of course , you think all that you get a great value for 150 £ a year here , but for folks who &apos;s for 150 £ a lot of money is , ask me if that &apos;s true , as they consume not much from the BBC . &quot;
&quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 @-@ Chef David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , asked that the BBC review their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission to provide information , to form and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little about the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that there are 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in the radio -- and it should be informed about the public @-@ law television programs in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; to the question of partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like that of the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful of television are shown , and with the commercial Sen@@ alli@@ ances , to make everything online available . &quot;

&quot; the impul@@ ses are changed by the switching on Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are gene@@ tically modified to wear the membran@@ e channels that respond to ultr@@ aso@@ und channels . &quot;
more on this topic : researchers read and write the st@@ amp with light
&quot; the researchers said the wor@@ ms pointed the power of a new process , called Son@@ at@@ etics , where ultr@@ aso@@ und may be used to activate a range of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , resear@@ cher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day the dep@@ end@@ t method could replace a invasive method , the electrical impul@@ ses into the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Par@@ kin@@ son &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; mer@@ wor@@ ms usually do not react to ultr@@ aso@@ und but Chal@@ as@@ ani determined that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid hand with micro@@ s@@ copic bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the blad@@ der , he found out , rein@@ force the ultr@@ aso@@ und waves , which then penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms . &quot;
the enhanced ultr@@ aso@@ und bodies have to be called in structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 channels and be found in the membran@@ es of some of the lit@@ ters .
&quot; the sound@@ proof@@ ing effect the opening of these is@@ bl@@ ets and activate the cells that they are assigned , such a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; to create ultr@@ aso@@ und bal@@ ato@@ id , Chal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically modified the wor@@ ms so that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ s TR@@ P @-@ 4 channels carry . &quot;
&quot; if he applied ultr@@ aso@@ und on the changed creatures , the reson@@ ates are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ plates and transfer into the wor@@ ms where they turn the changed Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ etics , a ground@@ breaking tool , the scientist allows , neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light and switching . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ia could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , that has to be sent to an optical fiber to the desired location in the brain , Ni@@ ed@@ rig@@ al @-@ ultr@@ aso@@ und tissues may happen , and can be delivered so in the brain from above at the sk@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gen@@ y and a therapeutic virus it is possible , the specified human neur@@ ons tempor@@ arily sus@@ cep@@ tible to the ultr@@ aso@@ und signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments &quot; , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student dor@@ ms
&quot; eleven years ago I moved as a self @-@ for@@ get@@ ful 19 @-@ year @-@ old baby , still in the faith of Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vism as yet now I remember the ten@@ se smiling of those who I saw themselves - and to the numerous , long @-@ leg@@ ged complaints about others . &quot;

the dis@@ ade in student dor@@ mit@@ es ranges from easy ner@@ ve @-@ wr@@ acking up to absolutely fri@@ ght@@ ening .

&quot; a girl on my hall asked her neighbours , whether it leaves them something to put something , Drum &amp; bass , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they re@@ acted on it with even more loud music .
&quot; when they finally heard at 5 p.m. , she didn &apos;t even let her neighbors as@@ le@@ ep two hours before playing their own music , their door locked and beg@@ ining their thir@@ st test . &quot;
would it not be romantic when your future spouse would random@@ ly go into the same student residence ?
&quot; vice versa , it would not be profound embarrass@@ ing if you want to see a room@@ mate for your future sp@@ ouses , to separate yourself and see them every day , and perhaps experience how to move all common friends ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes his own paths , but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future sp@@ ouses , try at least to settle a little reason at least . &quot;
&quot; in an exciting moment , in which you notice that someone can lay his keys in his un@@ developed room is the border between a Ul@@ k and Mob@@ bing F@@ einer , as it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good match is fun , but it only takes moments until he becomes bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
share through dres@@ sing a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety - but do not get someone &apos;s room with to@@ oth@@ paste and shamp@@ oo .
&quot; shut your door , and place their keys in a glass of water , which you then put in the free@@ zer - but do not spare their pos@@ sessions on the ceiling no more than twice . &quot;
&quot; semi @-@ detached dwell@@ ings for refugees , om@@ ast@@ ering , straight@@ ener &quot;
the real estate corporation Markus G@@ ild@@ ner builds in the medi@@ a@@ que Eck@@ ental @-@ Sem@@ i @-@ Sem@@ i @-@ Sem@@ i @-@ detached houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need a living room , but also the cre@@ eping mother and the bar@@ ley @-@ deser@@ ved . &quot;
&quot; I am showing how to still cheap and well build well today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview
thousands of refugees will push for the residential market .
the ent@@ repren@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes to know how quickly cheaper housing can be created : it builds in a project consisting of refugees for refugees .
Mr G@@ ild@@ ner and many refugees will push for the residence .
what solution can you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : mass accommodation in containers or athle@@ h@@ all has no sustainability .
because people are staying in a great part here .
&quot; in the face of the refu@@ gee space , we also need enough living space over the next decades . &quot;
&quot; a quite ban@@ ana , three @-@ detached house @-@ detached house is the solution . &quot;
G@@ ild@@ ner : a town@@ house takes the least space .
it facilit@@ ates integration .
that is different when people spend the people in dor@@ b@@ loc@@ s .
&quot; each of the six houses that are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three units of each four asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees will say , it is peace , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can easily be transformed according to the respective needs .
how much is the cost ?
&quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house is on 184 000 euros , without land . &quot;
this is man@@ age@@ able .
six months the construction has taken .
this is appropriate .
have the construction regulations set up their plans ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : remains to properly conducted my project correctly .
it is especially complicated to always make it the dro@@ pping D@@ amo@@ kl@@ es@@ tion Special and the Pit@@ ts .
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
&quot; it is still under@@ lined that in one town@@ house three apartments creates , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
there is no space in the cities in the cities .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers do not have cars .
how did the An@@ ans respond to her Sem@@ i @-@ detached house ?
&quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : there was , those who have thrown to me , Lux@@ us@@ cs for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
which is definitely not true .
but does not exac@@ erb@@ ate the ri@@ val fight for affordable housing ?
&quot; however , G@@ ild@@ ner : true is : we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but construction style rooms , which can hardly be done any more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , also the normal people need living space . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but just as well as the mother @-@ moving mother or the right@@ ed @-@ th@@ ener . &quot;
I am showing how to practice at a low cost and well being able to build well .
that is why it is about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS when Apple was released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by selecting the setup @-@ app , click &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
if it is ready to install the phone the option to download and then install Inst@@ all .
&quot; some are pushed after installation to problems since they receive an error message , which is hur@@ he@@ aled that the &quot; software update failed . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to avoid the problem , users is recommended , either to wait until the crash one goes back or try to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself takes you through the remain@@ der of the process .
&quot; this may mean the delet@@ ing of apps to create space - but Apple was made easier to do this by the penetration of the updates . likewise , it will be easier to set up apps and then install them new once the process is complete . &quot;
&quot; it is worth to ensure that your mobile phone is loaded during the update or is located close to a char@@ ger , so the battery is loaded . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple does not leave that the update will continue , since the phone may not be applied to half way , and this can lead to a break of the updates . &quot;

Dr. Frank Müller takes responsibility wheels and invested 310@@ 000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take on the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ res@@ h .
&quot; moreover , Sam@@ t@@ gu@@ .com Bernd Bor@@ mann , Economic Recovery in U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Sch@@ wart@@ z and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs Major Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the countryside , doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf who are lucky : there will be taking place Dr. Frank Müller on October 1 . &quot;
&quot; during Ur@@ sel Fel@@ res@@ h , her husband , Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing in his successor to the next months to half a half . &quot;
&quot; after a reconstruction phase , Müller opened the practice on 12 October , up to 310 000 euros in the premises at St.@@ -@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was li@@ ke@@ able at first sight , when Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who currently gradu@@ ated their expertise in today &apos;s hospital and want to rise in practice again . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the g@@ arb@@ age would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ res@@ ausen and laugh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; when I was , I just arrived it out . &quot;
the couple of Müller suffered the idea of operating in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we would like to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he will see his own boss soon . &quot;
&quot; and so one became one , the g@@ arb@@ age bought the house with the practice . &quot;
they will continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen Vil@@ sen .
&quot; there is the two @-@ fold family @-@ grandfather Frank Müller , who followed his medi@@ t@@ inst@@ um in Hannover , which followed some stations in several medical practice as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; at present , he is working as an insu@@ lator in Sul@@ ingen , and also he was appointed as the introduc@@ tory emergency unit in the district of Di@@ ep@@ holz and is involved in the DR@@ C @-@ willingness of Bru@@ ch@@ hausen . &quot;
from the 19th of September the practice will be prepared for the new boss .
&quot; during the surge@@ on Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ris@@ otto as a household doctor , his cre@@ tin Ur@@ sel has specialised in gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the g@@ arb@@ lers , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as home@@ opath@@ y . &quot;
&quot; hence the end@@ os@@ copy is therefore out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll . &quot;
after the renovation the rooms are modern look .
we will offer more ultr@@ aso@@ und exam@@ inations as well as long @-@ term and loading @-@ EK@@ GS and need a microphone room more .
&quot; furthermore , the ED@@ V will also be renewed . &quot;
&quot; a grant from a total of 50000 Euro will get the g@@ arb@@ lers within the framework of a conveyor program ( 25@@ ,000 euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ ,000 euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; that shows how proud and glad we are , that the practice will continue , &quot; &quot; stres@@ ses the &quot; &quot; ejacul@@ atory &quot; &quot; Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; approximately 2000 patients come according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , each quarter into the practice of Fel@@ res@@ h , in the North @-@ German inci@@ dent , there are approximately 500 . &quot;
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another home office .
a positive side effects of the practical examination by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ res@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; if no replacement would have found , it would also be . &quot;
&quot; who visits the g@@ arb@@ lers @-@ hour , it looks also above all in familiar faces : will take over the seven medical professional employees and the cleaning force of the field . &quot;
&quot; with the far@@ ewell we end in A@@ sen@@ dorf , an era , after all when the medical technology was practic@@ ed for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; remember Ur@@ sel Field Res@@ urrection . &quot;
a little melanch@@ ol@@ y they left after the long time already .
&quot; but we live in Hohen@@ fashion@@ or and we will see many patients more often , &quot; &quot; says the dor@@ mit@@ ory . &quot;
your man compl@@ ements : &quot; we have a 6000 @-@ square meter property . &quot;
&quot; up to now I always pressed down to garden work , now that could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the pair of two grand@@ children and likes . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees by &quot;
&quot; now the border controls will also be made at our southern border , &quot; said Interior @-@ Minister of Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel to this .
&quot; however , it is clear that everyone wants to make a asylum application to make this too &quot; &quot; of course &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the provision and safety of people stand in the for@@ eground .
&quot; but it is also clear that there are plain signals needed , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; people must know that we do not accept un@@ bound@@ less migration flows , nor over the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled procedure .
Croatia acqu@@ ires &quot; cor@@ rid@@ or &quot; - Slovenia
&quot; the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wants to continue to continue displac@@ ed refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany , and under certain circumstances cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees . &quot;
&quot; so I saw the Minister of Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely in@@ akzeptabel , &quot; Slovenia , rather , the surveillance of the border - especially to Hungary - intensi@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; however , the border with Croatia is at the same time controlled as the outside border of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ ians will not succeed in so its borders for refugees but not . &quot;
&quot; every EU member must fill its commitments , or else the system may not work &quot; , &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; like the Croatian Government , the first refugees would have already tried in the follow @-@ up to the Tuesday , in East Croatian and crossing the border crossing the border crossing the border crossing the border crossing the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d . &quot;
the Croatian police could gra@@ b it in the near mark@@ e@@ fields .
&quot; according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik are ever meeting of police vehicles with new refugees . &quot;
&quot; it is primarily a Syrian and Af@@ gh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
ambul@@ ance and the Red Cross were already in use .
&quot; in the days of the coming days , he will be reck@@ oned to some 4000 refugees , said the Minister of the R@@ anko Ost@@ oj@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo had driven to the Maced@@ onian border that hi@@ ther@@ to the Hungarian border so far , Croatian and Ser@@ bian media had coinci@@ ded on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the government in Belgrade , however , that it is to take people wise to take certain routes : &quot; neither can we do , nor do we want to do so . &quot;
&quot; according to the media report , at least in the morning a first bus with around 50 refugees arrive at the Ser@@ bian border town Si@@ d , during the course of the day , further buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the in@@ mates were all night away from the Maced@@ onian border of Serbia around 500 kilometres away .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary made us , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in this way , it could actually actually lead to the observations of the previous Balkan route from Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Macedonia @-@ Hungary to a little further west distance . &quot;
&quot; Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot;
&quot; Croatia &apos;s Interior , Ost@@ oj@@ ic had stressed that his country was prepared for the fall of a strong state of refugees , for possible fail@@ ures . &quot;
&quot; details called it not , he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has a comprehensive range of opportunities for the border control . &quot;
they lead strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners in the country have since passed a good testimony to what the standard of border controls has passed since 2007 . &quot;
&quot; on the Hungarian border , there are still some 300 refugees to be stuck in the Hungarian border area . &quot;
&quot; according to the interests of the media , they would have spent the past night at the border crossing H@@ org@@ os , who leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border crossing h@@ org@@ os and Back@@ i Bre@@ g will continue to be fully locked . &quot;
whether the remaining refugees trying to continue to travel to Croatian border is still un@@ clear .
the Ser@@ bian Minister of N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to be at a re@@ ven@@ ge at a local trail in H@@ org@@ os : he kept the debates on altern@@ ativ@@ ures of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed to re@@ former .
it would not have to deal with very high refu@@ gee rights .
&quot; we could not say whether they would continue to continue their trip over Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers betra@@ y migrants to - dangerous - Alternative Appro@@ aches
&quot; however , private Hungarian refu@@ gee heroes have already begun to distribute land maps , to which alternative routes are shown by Croatia . &quot;
&quot; but the bor@@ derland between Serbia and Croatia is not harm@@ less : in parts of the border area , there are still 20 years after the end of Croatia &apos;s victory . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police had announced that a team of min@@ e@@ wers has been sent to the border region . &quot;

Fed@@ Ex @-@ results mixed to cut Fin@@ anz @-@ outlook for 2016
&quot; Fed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appoint@@ ing results for the last quarter , and the Li@@ efer Gig@@ ant lowers its profit view on a whole year because of the weak@@ ening demand for frei@@ ght @-@ performance and higher costs in its Bod@@ rum machine . &quot;
&quot; the company also said that she is planning to tackle , about 5@@ 5.000 seasons for holiday . &quot;
&quot; at this time last year , Fed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set 5@@ 0,000 seasons for holiday season . &quot;
the share dropped over 2.5 per cent in the pre @-@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; Fed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a gain between 10,@@ 40 and 10,@@ 90 in the financial year that ends in the next May , 20 cent less than during the previous pre@@ diction . &quot;
&quot; analy@@ sts anticipated according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ set 10,@@ 84 $ . &quot;
&quot; the lower views comes in spite of the price increase , which is average of 4,@@ 9 per cent and in spite of higher supplements for Bod@@ rum points of heavy and large packages which will be raised from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said that , however , that the result is expected to increase the earnings higher compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and because of growth in online trading . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company will deliver sound y@@ ields when one is the we@@ aker than expected economic conditions , above all in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; plans for the holiday employment were announced one day later than the Ri@@ val UPS announced that plans , 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5.000 additional labour force , about the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , which ended on August 31 , Fed@@ Ex 692 million $ , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; the earnings per share stood at $ 2,@@ 42 per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research and asked analy@@ sts are predic@@ ted . &quot;
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion euros .
six of cy@@ mb@@ acks were anticipated analy@@ sts anticipated 12.@@ 23 billion $ .
&quot; in recent years Fed@@ Ex has to record a decrease in international primary shipping , which brought its sales in its unity express shipping . &quot;
but the boom in online @-@ shopping has increased the results with Fed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter , sales at the Bod@@ escap@@ ing rose by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for greater packages and self @-@ assurance . &quot;
&quot; the Express unit noted higher revenue due to higher rates , while the result due to higher labour costs in the frei@@ ghter . &quot;
&quot; in the pre @-@ market trade , about an hour before opening , the Fed@@ Ex shares by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2,5 per cent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they joined 11 percent loss for the year and 17 per cent under a record high on 11 . June . &quot;
&quot; due to their most anticipated meeting in the year Federal Reserve Strateg@@ ic spent two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot visitors @-@ Mah@@ ag@@ oni table sitting in order to decide whether it is time , for the first time in nearly a decade to up@@ lift the benchmark . &quot;
&quot; Dro@@ h@@ end on them at an end of the consumed , two @-@ stor@@ ey@@ ed seat acid is a wall Picture of the United States . &quot;
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues want to put their economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a secondary order from the congress : maxim@@ izing the US &apos;s employment and prices here stable .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have recognized that there is a not@@ ated mandate : financial stability .
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight for it . it is announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to get acc@@ ust@@ omed from the un@@ preced@@ ented incentive since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most data of the economy indicate that it is solid , the latest tur@@ mo@@ il may increase the most recent turbul@@ ence on global financial markets , these vol@@ atil@@ ity due to the lifting of the interest for federal government - and be it only around 1 quarter percent@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; obviously the labour market and inflation in the first place will be the most important thing you observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Chef@@ china in the Mak@@ ler@@ firma Sti@@ ll Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think that if they were looking for a pre@@ text to do not increase the interest rate , the increased in@@ security around the global market remains enough justi@@ fication , continue to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which sec@@ ures itself in itself the financial market . &quot;
&quot; about half the econom@@ ists , which were recently inter@@ viewed by Bloom@@ berg , have predic@@ ted this week . &quot;
&quot; however , financial markets are expecting a wait for F@@ ed , with a key indic@@ ator , which shows only a 30 % chance of increasing the increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline of the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , it is because the Strateg@@ ic change the strike down by talking to that a further increase is far away . &quot;
on Tuesday ap@@ rang the D@@ ow Jones Industrial Average value around 228@@ ,@@ 89 points or by 1,4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations , that the F@@ ed policy is maintained the sentence in this week , John Lon@@ is said boss , Chief of Moody &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would lift the pro@@ positions at this time , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if you do it , they would have to go very far in their declaration to re@@ assure the financial markets so that they may not get into panic . &quot;
&quot; other experts argu@@ ed that a inser@@ tion of financial markets would be so@@ othing , because they will eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed action would eliminate . &quot;
&quot; even before one month the F@@ ed seemed to be sure to increase the set of 0,@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tight@@ ening of the mon@@ et@@ arian conditions , which would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that in spite of the complaints of Liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be needed , an increase in the proposition . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs in August was required , the improvement of the labour market in this year was solid . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate decreased in 5.@@ 1 % last month , the lowest for over seven years and close to the levels , which sees the F@@ ed as a full @-@ activity . &quot;
consultations have shown signs of a recovery .
&quot; and although inflation continued to pass under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed Repres@@ ent@@ atives said that the main reason the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can master higher interest rates and needs it because of the tension on the job market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ epher@@ d@@ son , Chief @-@ kon@@ oma from Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot;
but financial markets all over the world coinci@@ ded with the end of the last month after China had evaluated its currency .
&quot; the D@@ ow Jones Industrial Revolution fell in May at more than 16 % under his maximum , than investors fear@@ ed that a slow@@ down of Chinese economy would become the global growth drug . &quot;
&quot; the market is recovered in this month , whereby the D@@ ow is now around 10 % under the stool of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed Repres@@ ent@@ atives affect the market turbul@@ ence the complexity increases , when to raise interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if events occur on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of Chinese economy in recent weeks would not have occurred , &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low on U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of U.S. emergency . &quot;
&quot; now , he predic@@ t that they will wait at least a month to get the impact better into the handle . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable information that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is none of the leaders , therefore they should not be involved in their decision @-@ making . &quot;
but in the end the F@@ ed monetary authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank has suffered enorm@@ ously in recent years .
&quot; the mere notice of the then Lei@@ ters Ben S. Bern@@ anke was born in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could per@@ ish its mon@@ et@@ ous expansion &quot; , &quot; mis@@ erable Tur@@ b@@ ings around the world . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly wast@@ ed , can be seen from the F@@ ed Repres@@ ent@@ atives , that they are not only advis@@ ing the developments in another location , but also with other central banks and experts to find a better understanding of global economy . &quot;
&quot; their decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ abell , head of global strategy for assets of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , not@@ ated this month that the F@@ ed has a history of excess @-@ actions on financial market movements , which appear with apparently not linked to economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; cr@@ acker , un@@ anim@@ ous member of the Federal Open Market Committee , advoc@@ ated for a inser@@ tion , limited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to cut its guidance in order to cut 0,@@ 75 percentage points into three sessions , despite limited recogni@@ z@@ able impact on growth in the United States . &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed Repres@@ ent@@ atives took these cuts .
&quot; the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis like the market re@@ unification in 2008 , Adam S. P@@ ants , former member of the Committee for the Z@@ ins@@ ect of the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; recent tur@@ mo@@ il do not come close to this plane , he said . &quot;
&quot; it certainly does not want to get into the situation in which they are afraid of a inser@@ tion , because the markets are exciting , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act always contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that changed , I do not believe that it was required for the time . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ shilfe for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany during those days .
&quot; to prepare a warm welcome , not without the engagement of our honor@@ able volunteer . &quot;
&quot; also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , there are a number of people who support un@@ anim@@ ous asylum seek@@ ers in the city . &quot;
among them are Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is with body and soul teacher .
even with their 74 L@@ enzen she has still taught her .
every Thursday she does on the asylum seek@@ er at the D@@ ill@@ inger street .
&quot; there she helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , the very different classes are regarded as being at the right school . &quot;
Brasili@@ a pa@@ edi@@ atric Association Rio Grande supports nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
&quot; the Brazi@@ lian organization SP@@ RS is trying to clarify women on shock@@ ing how important good nutrition during the breast@@ feeding is . she does this with the presentation of images of babies , who su@@ ck in br@@ ust , who are painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy food . &quot;
&quot; mother &apos;s milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that they need all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young Mothers come out to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake around 500 cal@@ ories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results suggest that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only reason that sh@@ ields the m@@ others . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet flu@@ ctu@@ ating women actually affects the gen@@ es of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system . &quot;
for the new amber for the sports hall
the Gemein@@ der@@ at Bern@@ ried approved the job@@ site for the 2.3 million euros of co@@ orth@@ or@@ ate .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be flat@@ ter for solar system .
&quot; the plant@@ ations for the long run @-@ m@@ illing , at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ sman come step by step : in recent municipal council , the worked art was blessed with no big discussions . &quot;
&quot; previously the Panel had decided to include a request for a new legal &quot; &quot; excluding &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; from valid development plan . &quot;
the &quot; exception &quot; was used to permit permission to form a special form regarding the roof construction .
&quot; therefore , a &quot; saddle &quot; &quot; was supposed to be er@@ ected with non @-@ term First and Dach@@ stein &quot; . &quot; &quot;
background the planning is the intended use of the roof for solar systems : &quot; through this we get a beautifully large south @-@ roof together &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting .
&quot; in turn , it was again about the bad@@ ge , which is for energetic reasons - unlike in the development plan - should lie in ten degrees . &quot;
the volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because of the development plan regarding the roof pitch no &quot; exceptions &quot; - with the Bern@@ rie@@ der Municip@@ al Council usually more restric@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; however at the gym , there is no recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create precision waste &quot; , &quot; said St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the Turn@@ hor@@ ticulture at the Sports Centre is a Community project of the municipality and the SV Bern@@ ried .
at the expense of costs around 2.3 million euros are calculated .
supplements are expected from school and lati@@ tude .
the next trial stage will be submitted for the 18 x 36 metres long hall now presented to the Land@@ rat@@ c .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ff@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ff@@ berg shall be closed before as planned - in 2016 .
at the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) became new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of the staff are drawn from P@@ ei@@ ff@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; these are the surprising ways of hospital GmbH of the Land@@ qu@@ ent , the land@@ lady Andrea Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White confirmed . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision on the re@@ efs of the Super@@ visory Board , and the down@@ turn on Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; if the plans are implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees would continue to hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg . &quot;
the overwhelming majority of solar powered by Fischer and the further existing inside to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
&quot; the employees , who can not be offered with Sch@@ ong@@ au , is said to be offered in Wei@@ l@@ heim a workplace so Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White . &quot;
the staff were informed about the plans .
&quot; triggered the change the cancellation of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only changed since the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic and is now adapted to a private practice in direct vicinity of the hospital . &quot;
&quot; on the question of who to enter the Succ@@ ession , the name of &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , the name of &quot; Fischer &quot; in the game , which was prepared to take the leadership and switch to his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au bo@@ ute this in any case a &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; and an wi@@ dening of the range in &quot; internal medicine &quot; , &quot; says Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White . &quot;
fishermen is a specialist for cardi@@ pac@@ em@@ aker and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialised in the inner station on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ologic diseases .
&quot; in addition for the next two years , fishermen with his team , when the Super@@ visory Board will meet to meet both houses , until then next year the former hospital of Kn@@ app@@ ella , which has still been closed over 35 beds in P@@ ei@@ pass@@ berg after nearly 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the Land@@ marks had planned this for 2018 if the currently running refurb@@ ishment is finished at the Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital . &quot;

&quot; I close this . as it moves with the property , Jo@@ ch@@ ner could not say , it could give several refl@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; at present , there are a short @-@ time care of the Car@@ itas and a conference @-@ conditioning . &quot;
&quot; what Bess@@ er could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; said Fischer on the Qu@@ asi Mo@@ ve to Le@@ ch , who has been received positively and very understanding . &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house , in which fishermen have worked as Chief physician for over 30 years , did not have it . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take the post of medical director .
&quot; the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was again threatened by closure , departments were closed , for example the surgery and the birth . &quot;

a since Saturday missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palatinate is a non @-@ violent crime to the victim .
&quot; the group of young woman was found in Rock@@ enhau@@ sen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern at Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern to Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as prosec@@ ut@@ or and police on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; as a tat@@ to@@ l , one also applies to the service @-@ evening 20 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old , who in fact lead the indication rather and the investig@@ ator led to the locality of the body . &quot;
&quot; the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was missing on Sunday morning , after they did not miss on the eve for a visit to a fall in Rock@@ enhau@@ sen . &quot;
when searching for the young woman the investig@@ ators initially appeared on personal belong@@ ings of the victim .
&quot; in surveys in the friends and acquain@@ t@@ ances of the missing , finally , a crime against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;

refugees need accommodation : study war@@ ned against residential gap
the location on the German ground @-@ market is ten@@ se .
even more refugees are looking for a pay@@ able lead .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
Social housing is facing a challenge .
the separ@@ ator fig@@ hts on the German self @-@ market have long since begun .
&quot; with the subsequent refugees and working seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are moving towards a market that is already over@@ bur@@ dened in many large cities . &quot;
they compete with one @-@ purpose weak citizens for the last affordable housing .
&quot; to cover the demand for affordable housing , would have to be built 400@@ ,000 new units by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; at this end , a study on behalf of the band@@ with &quot; &quot; social housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; compared : this year , 26@@ 0,000 units are finished in Germany . &quot;
&quot; therefore , 14@@ 0,000 apartments are lacking . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer oblig@@ ated to live as asylum seek@@ ers in the first three months of their stay . &quot;
many rep@@ ay@@ er then come across the residential market and occupy themselves in the long sn@@ akes in front of the rented apartments .
&quot; according to the Statistical Office &apos;s Bundes@@ amt stayed in the last year , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers to rent . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the living side is not only to the rising refu@@ gee figures . &quot;
the study also makes considerable om@@ is@@ sions in residential construction policy of recent years .
&quot; Germany shi@@ fted a residential defic@@ it in front of each year , which is bigger from year to year . &quot;
&quot; currently , in the ball@@ lists areas were already around 77@@ 0,000 residential units , by indic@@ ted Matthias Gün@@ ther , author of the study . &quot;
many working people do not dwell in large cities in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults remained un@@ tar@@ ily due to the fl@@ oss of the apartment inde@@ vol@@ un@@ tar@@ ily longer in the &quot; hotel m@@ um . &quot;
in the large cities the number of square meters per head have fallen in the last few years for the first time .
&quot; to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; &quot; social housing construction &quot; is a new start . &quot;
new incentives are to boost new incentives for the social housing construction .
&quot; thus , the tax ev@@ asion could be ref@@ uted and the tax ev@@ asion for funded apartments must be fixed . &quot;
&quot; according to alli@@ ances , attractive tax @-@ waste may be necessary . &quot;
the convey@@ ing programme for refu@@ gee camps at the K@@ f@@ W is now very good in cities and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after the start was upgra@@ ded to 184 million euros with a total of around 300 million euros . &quot;
&quot; now , the project could even be raised . &quot;
refugees have a free time : Croatia and Slovenia are directed cor@@ rid@@ or
&quot; after Hungary virtually no longer come through , there are more and more refugees crossing the way over Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb announces the journey of Slovenia to North without a hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous but it is still dangerous .
Croatia wants to interact with neighbouring countries on the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ or for refugees .
&quot; I talked to the Sloven@@ ian ex@@ minist@@ ries , and if it is necessary we will organize a cor@@ rid@@ or , &quot; said the Croatian Minister of R@@ anko Ost@@ oj@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
EU @-@ Land Croatia is not a Schengen country .
&quot; following the postpon@@ ement of the hung@@ arian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees trying to arrive to Croatia from there to Western Europe . &quot;
&quot; 500 people have come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian television station RT@@ L reports . &quot;
Hungary had regulated its border to refugees on the day of the day .
&quot; new laws that occurred on the same day into force , this decent asylum procedures in Hungary will be practically super@@ flu@@ ous . &quot;
Croatia wants to pass refugees to happen .
&quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic stated : &quot; &quot; you can go through , and we prepare for this opportunity . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
but people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police took up the first refugees on the border of Serbia on the border of Serbia on the border of Serbia on the border of Serbia .
&quot; most of the owners , say , according to Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came both by bus and tax@@ is to the Ser@@ bian border town Si@@ d .
immediately after their arrival they had tried to arrive on foot via the green border to Croatia .
&quot; on the Croatian @-@ Ser@@ b border , the refugees arrive not on the border . &quot;
&quot; this holds the limits of the borders of other dangers , which is there a sharp Min@@ es from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s . &quot;
min@@ ent sp@@ atial must quickly create a secure gateway .
&quot; after Hungary , after the closing of the border no more refugees arrive . &quot;
on Tuesday the police described the police of 366 .
shortly before Tor@@ r on Monday there were still 93@@ 80 .
the new Hungarian laws to overcome the over@@ coming and deteri@@ oration of the limit count as a crime .
&quot; therefore , 35 criminal proceedings were introduced in the South @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eged . &quot;
condem@@ ned the judgment in prison up to five years and the ex@@ tradition from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , one took on Tuesday to the newly appointed &quot; Tran@@ se@@ ons &quot; &quot; in a total of 94 kinder@@ garten , nearly all of them - 93 - the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ gen . &quot;
&quot; among the applic@@ ants , 13 families with small children and two elderly people . &quot;
there were still 40 refugees on Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; however , there was no one who granted asylum in Hungary in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; after an Indian view , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; safe third country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the exp@@ ired asylum seek@@ ers should be de@@ ported there .
&quot; in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in Rome , few hundred refugees were gathered . &quot;
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke the workers began to settle for .
&quot; they gathered the tr@@ ash , who left the t@@ enth of people in the past weeks left at the road@@ side . &quot;
block@@ r@@ ences were re@@ constructed and one of the t@@ ager in the bor@@ derland was changed .
for the purpose of this reconstruction nobody wanted to express themselves .
Austria follow the border between Serbia and Hungary only a few refugees .
the country also has increased its border controls .
&quot; around the 20,000 immigrants took place in government dimensions but in the country . &quot;
around 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany in Salzburg .
the train from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the statement of German authorities in the morning .
in acqu@@ isi@@ tions regularly met smaller groups of refugees on foot .
Mayor sought &quot; gest@@ ed &quot; across the border
&quot; we were busy after the brid@@ ging on Sunday with the au@@ fr@@ y when suddenly ten people stood with travel off@@ ences at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; says Wern@@ stein &apos;s Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted by train to Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; because Germany had surprisingly the railway traffic in Austria because of the refu@@ gee stream stations with Austria , was promp@@ ted for them in Wern@@ stein , &quot; so city , who immediately offered his help and the bases was ch@@ opped together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars on the border to the Pass@@ au River . &quot;
&quot; before , we have only shor@@ ten@@ ed the un@@ hop@@ ed guests once , with J@@ ause and drinks . &quot;
&quot; we have said immediately , we bring it by car to Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; that was of course for us , &quot; so city @-@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let it take to pass a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire .
&quot; this was very happy , so city . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday evening , one ICE have risen in Wels from a ICE in a regional train direction Pass@@ au to leave it after short notice that rail traffic has been dis@@ continued to Germany yet still over the border . &quot;
but the regional train was put in front of the border in Wern@@ stein am Inn .
in Wern@@ stein , the cross @-@ border is generally high in the course . &quot;
the brid@@ ging association with the Bav@@ arian neighbours on Sunday hosted a two @-@ run spor@@ ty - organized by the Union Wern@@ stein and Bayern from Neu@@ kirchen .
&quot; that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has now been sent to us further to@@ ig@@ mill@@ en@@ nia , is a logical result of a seem@@ ingly sacred policy : &quot;
&quot; instead of helping Russia to help the establishment of structures that ensure humanity , our Chancellor is highly officially and publicly de@@ ed the attitude of the Hungarian government into the Dun@@ st@@ ork National Soci@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; however , there are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic states that are now facing the border areas with cha@@ otic states . &quot;
&quot; also the refu@@ gee will have to find that the &quot; &quot; pra@@ ised land &quot; , &quot; which they invited and welcome to be welcomed , nothing but another refu@@ gee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a great challenge , given the continuing refu@@ gee streams and the near winter , in us to make decent conditions for protective seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; and there will be another greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Kon@@ rad in search of 35.@@ 000 winter@@ s Quar@@ ter@@ ing &quot;
Kon@@ rad has full of his hands with the refu@@ gee spreading all hands .
Christian Kon@@ rad is used to say that his word weight has weight .
the government has used the earlier powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen @-@ Ban@@ ker in order to stop lod@@ g@@ ings for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first @-@ trial of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on .
&quot; we have no hom@@ eless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot;
&quot; also the accommodation of 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday , be without great vor@@ tex , Con@@ rad and lob@@ te the organis@@ ational &quot; champ@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Ministry was said , in contrast , from a &quot; political situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total , Kon@@ rad expects a requirement of 8@@ 5.000 deposits in the he@@ ur@@ ged year . &quot;
&quot; to meet the number , we have to be found in the next weeks of 35.@@ 000 accommodations - 20,000 will be available to the countries , 15.000 of the Bund . &quot;
&quot; if there were more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a barrel without ground , &quot; said Kon@@ rad . &quot;
he has already conducted talks with the govern@@ or .
&quot; they would have promised him , even for the coming refugees lod@@ g@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Austria it runs well , &quot; Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er . &quot;
the former VP @-@ mand@@ atar supports con@@ rad .
&quot; tomorrow , there will be a meeting with Card@@ inal Christoph Schön@@ born , the meeting will be clari@@ fied as the Church will help . &quot;
&quot; great expectations constitutes the asylum seek@@ er as well as to the OR@@ F action &quot; , &quot; as we do . &quot;
private people can offer un@@ complicated accommodation on the platform .
&quot; in addition , one hopes on hotels that are empty during winter . &quot;
Kon@@ rad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ises the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
&quot; in times of times , it could not be that lod@@ g@@ ings have to stick a certain height of the tow@@ el or size of the duties . &quot;
for a temporary time must have to apply &quot; emergency standards . &quot;
&quot; that he was successful in contrast to the Interior of accommodation , he is based on his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an older gent@@ lem@@ an , which one cannot say without further into the face of ignor@@ ance . &quot;
per@@ su@@ ading is his most important weapon .
&quot; Kon@@ rad and Mai@@ er cause no cost , as they said . &quot;
your employees want to increase their workforce to three or four .
their own source search has not been successful yet .
Kon@@ rad would want to place a container at the Stephan@@ splatz in the office .
but there are apparently problems with the permit .
Linz demands a better distribution
&quot; in advance , no opening of urban sports and other buildings like Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to arrange refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary for the moment , because people might be able to sub@@ ordin@@ ate the person concerned without these measures , the may@@ or Klaus L@@ ug@@ er ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; however , for the emergency , further sites are to be tested for their pig@@ ment . &quot;
criticism is carried out by the municipal office to the division of refugees within the federal country .
&quot; other areas , too , must do their account here . &quot;
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in a longer call with the Bav@@ arian Prime Minister Ni@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) the govern@@ or Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday the further action of the refu@@ gee question .
&quot; Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer has assured me that German borders are not sealed . &quot;
the journey of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany will continue to be possible .
&quot; however , there will be the corresponding border controls now . &quot;
there will be no more special cases with refugees to Germany .
but the precau@@ tions would however have brought to Germany with regular gul@@ ps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; by the other EU member states , called for greater solidarity in the refu@@ gee question . &quot;
&quot; that now Austria sets forth again in its borders , is a logical consequence &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; of the action of the Germans . &quot;
the next Run@@ tas@@ tic is a question of time
&quot; the &quot; &quot; new shi@@ py@@ ard &quot; &quot; in the Lin@@ er Industrial header is officially completed . &quot;
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production buildings , the B@@ ör@@ sen@@ ot@@ ated IT @-@ Group S &amp; T , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meter ) is to be rented to young , innovative enterprises from the technology area . &quot;
&quot; in IT , the clever heads our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T @-@ Chef Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
&quot; he can imagine , in starting up @-@ up companies of the new shi@@ py@@ ard , and later also what to act . &quot;
&quot; from the beginning , S &amp; T he wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - of which Nieder@@ n@@ haus@@ er promises well : &quot; the next Run@@ tas@@ tic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; € 1,@@ 7 million euros have been invested in the location of € 3,@@ 3 million from the Tech@@ center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is taken from Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ center .
&quot; 30 per cent of the 27@@ 00 square meter in the building are already rented , for a further 40 percent give it requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ ator opened a second shop in the Arctic
in the new shop Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are at the center stage .
&quot; actually , J@@ utta wanted to put a dog on a dog . &quot;
this project had to record the 49 @-@ year blo@@ om by Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ arcade game : eventually she has got to get homes in the form of another business .
&quot; in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop towards the business they sold amongst other po@@ ckets , suit@@ cases , shoes and tissues of different manufacturers , now all around Dam@@ enh@@ and@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , Wall@@ ets are starting from 75 Euro . &quot;
larger bags and accessories are up to 500 euros .
since yesterday the new shop is in operation .
&quot; previously , several weeks has been re@@ constructed . &quot;
&quot; but I over@@ looked for a long time if I want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; she says ... &quot;
&quot; for the decision was among other things , that also the Fur@@ la producer , who are at home in Bologna , from the idea of an own site where only their hand@@ bags were sold , taken . &quot;
&quot; we are the Only in Greater Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has himself Italian roots . &quot;
your fashion interest has been laid wide by her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I exchange most when something develops and I can show new trends at reasonable prices .
&quot; why so some woman in sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in ornam@@ entation , the professional woman can not be answered with latest security . &quot;
perhaps it is because a nice bag is upgra@@ ded to each out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
&quot; the pe@@ al ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place , whose inhabitants are known for terror . &quot;
&quot; this property connects to some also with the billi@@ on@@ aire , the US president . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for challenging .
whether he is un@@ spoken by foreign hos@@ tile , journalists concerns or scientists in the international crisis policy - the applic@@ ant for the US presidential campaign against the election campaign power@@ fully . &quot;
and cuts well on .
&quot; this is also registered in the Sac@@ red K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate @-@ milli@@ ard@@ ines come from . &quot;
the New Yor@@ ker &apos;s co@@ ous@@ se is a concept for many in the Win@@ zer@@ village on the wine road .
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant @-@ place is related to him over -@@ ty corners with him .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palatinate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in the election campaign . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del la@@ thes a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do vill@@ agers think about its aim to become more powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find that somehow fascinating , but are not so deeply impressed in her un@@ bre@@ vity way , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has a am@@ using documentary on the place and its famous Spr@@ int , to which by Tru@@ mp also includes the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mod@@ esty , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly also be successful if he would live in Cape Town . &quot;
to the king of the hearts he did not put it there .
&quot; although respect for the performance of the family , but also ten@@ den@@ ounc@@ ed the opinion that Tru@@ mp &quot; is already a bit of a grand@@ mouth , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; sus@@ cep@@ tive of the nickname , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the vicinity , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ aker &quot; - to the German : the Inn@@ er , says it . &quot;
Tru@@ mp is thus coming from the village of Inn@@ er .
&quot; the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began 18@@ 85 , when the later Grand@@ father was hi@@ red and opened in the United States a Local for Gold@@ gr@@ ä@@ ber . &quot;
basic stone of the property management were first property purchases in New York .
&quot; but life of grand@@ parents was not free from Trag@@ ik : your desire , to return to the country , fail at the Bav@@ arian state , to which the Pfalz was at that time . &quot;
&quot; he did not admitted Tru@@ mp because he was once without a permit , the director of the Institute for Ga@@ el@@ ic History and Popular , Roland Paul , to the film start . &quot;
Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of a &quot; illegal immig@@ rant . &quot;
this is the contrast to the members of the descendants of the descendants .
&quot; that had repeatedly been repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall , to prevent illegal immigrants . &quot;
&quot; as the pol@@ len , this is not so person@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant twi@@ sted Tru@@ mp@@ s ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a new@@ born Tru@@ mp , the grand@@ pa was born baby ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ em@@ aker in retirement looks the Americans rather dis@@ soci@@ ated , &quot; he is always so cru@@ m@@ ous . &quot;
believe he is that Tru@@ mp Be@@ fore ?
&quot; I can not imagine , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Pen@@ sion@@ s@@ tin Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ramm was mentioned as some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz with a visit something for the church org@@ el ended , which was generally well ank@@ ind . &quot;
&quot; that can I not imagine by Donald &apos;s , says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; they are becoming better if he do not off@@ set the choice , because &quot; this has such radical views , I do not know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had the ages at the time of his grandfather in the US as they were , as he would have never arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ cat Sarah High@@ lands . &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; my president is not it , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; &quot; the grapes are also ri@@ pe without the President of Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ dels Film , was inter@@ viewed for the Tru@@ mp for a long time , have seen 12 000 Kin@@ og@@ än@@ ger , also in the United States . &quot;
the charming municipality of Ram@@ s@@ au at Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; Mountain@@ wal@@ ger@@ dorf &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from the hand of vice @-@ president in the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ ub@@ ennig , the 1800 @-@ inhabit@@ ant village in the national park Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden on Wednesday had the award for gentle tourism . &quot;
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; &quot; mines &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the neighboring land , the village of Alpen@@ land is responsible for the award of the distinction . &quot;
a &quot; mountain boo@@ ger &quot; must have maximum 2500 inhabitants .

&quot; Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son came to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report in connection to the loss of land@@ lords of the liber@@ als , but there has been no major shi@@ fts on the reviews for today . &quot;

&quot; this down@@ side of the insur@@ rection seemed to play a role for Australian TV @-@ viewers , since Sun@@ rise generated average 39@@ 7.@@ 000 viewers in the five capit@@ als , in comparison with today 33@@ 9,000 . &quot;
&quot; today , a slight increase in rates for Monday ( 317.@@ 000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
today in the last months the gap to sunrise .
in August Today was an average of 318.@@ 000 compared to the 33@@ 0.000 of Sun@@ rise .
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the gap between 4@@ 0.000 and 5@@ 0.000 . &quot;
&quot; until now in September , Sun@@ rise is at an average of 34@@ ,000 spect@@ ators to 314.@@ 000 at Today . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing happened every morning .

the great novel@@ ty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former seri@@ al of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama for a recent ver@@ wit@@ ted Father , who con@@ cludes with his two children in the New Zealand for@@ ge , achieved a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 219 million spect@@ ators . &quot;
critics were asked whether Thom@@ son had a hit @-@ show solo without the rafting Star Rebecca Gi@@ b@@ ney .
the result of yesterday evening rep@@ lied with a clear &apos; yes . &apos;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven stayed strong with 1,@@ 136 millions viewers and it hit the block ( 83@@ ,000 ) and T@@ B@@ L Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26,@@ 000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 bis 17.@@ 30 pm ) of the new Quiz @-@ Show , hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ep , from an average of 44@@ ,000 spect@@ ators . &quot;
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 PM to 18 : 00 ) sp@@ rang up to 6@@ 23,@@ 000 spect@@ ators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13.@@ 000 ) . &quot;

the last three coinci@@ de : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
Guestbook un@@ covered ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki obviously have un@@ familiar with who The bach@@ elor is winning . &quot;
&quot; the woman , at the Sam Wood has finally launched in The Bachelor &apos;s Bachelor , was fil@@ med in greatest sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not cost if they are the one that has received the last rose .
&quot; but when we work with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , Sne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before coming from three two , check@@ ered , you may possibly show an indication that who will be the victori@@ ous . &quot;
Sam Wood continues its lips until the finale on Thursday sealed .
&quot; all three women have left themselves in ly@@ rical way , why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of hum@@ our , ambi@@ tion , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; could their answers to the player &apos;s break , who won the heart of the Bachelor &apos;s . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki do both quickly - except Him@@ self - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner in Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went to the house and ( Sar@@ ah ) and S@@ ams energies noticeable , I felt that they were pretty compatible and I &apos;ve thought it throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah stands with both feet on earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; he added Sel@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood would be suitable as a couple .
&quot; from her perspective , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the gradu@@ al last week its clear made that Wood &quot; &quot; could be &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this obviously isn &apos;t just a game - I am now he@@ aled on him now , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when asked was asked to choose to whom Wood shall select , if not them , then she was puzz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say it , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a deci@@ de@@ dly between Sne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor will be released on Wednesday , 19 : 30@@ h , on Ten . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start its NF@@ L career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest following his move into the USA - and there were many other teams having sent to requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ sula and it looks like a smart decision .
&quot; some trainers might have Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank , when he lost a bar@@ code as it was the Aus@@ sie @-@ Rugby @-@ Return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota . &quot;
but Tom@@ sula close to his husband and gave Hay@@ es the next chance to a P@@ unt Return and also into the ongoing play after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sula still showed his true face in the lo@@ cker after the game .
&quot; instead of having asked his ro@@ ok@@ ies in the rest of the team by the mill , he encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ sula strengthened Hay@@ ne also publicly in his press conference after the game .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ es was also encouraged by special teams @-@ coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey to forget his for@@ et@@ ched catch , and to take care of the next game . &quot;
&quot; Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t was restored in a P@@ unt , who was restored in the first toy of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings . &quot;
it was certainly not the start to the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian ge@@ ography for his NF@@ L de@@ stu@@ d .
Hay@@ ne betra@@ y the Spiel@@ feld and told later the Australian radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not be worse into his NF@@ L career
&quot; it was an thing that comes from now , it only takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
Hay@@ ne started the Schn@@ it@@ zer with his Orig@@ in Deb@@ ut back then in 2007 when a pass ran into a Tr@@ y for Queensland in his own in @-@ Goal region .
overall it was a great experience for the 27 year old .

4 people killed after polic@@ emen stra@@ ins on prot@@ esters in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in the southern Nepal after the police introduced in a crowd making the proposed new constitution , said a Beam@@ ter on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out in the district R@@ up@@ an@@ de@@ hi , approximately 175 miles west from the capital city Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad Dh@@ ak@@ al , leading District Apost@@ le , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , taking some of you stones and brand@@ ing . &quot;
Mr Dh@@ ak@@ al said the police have deplo@@ yed t@@ än@@ eng@@ as and then shot into the air before they return on rubber .
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were wo@@ unded , &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the used rubber @-@ moul@@ ding , of which it is known that they can be used traditional as less fat@@ al alternative , apparently , such a high death rate produced . &quot;
&quot; the debate was the last in weeks of violent protest in Nep@@ al@@ as southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of M@@ adh@@ esi say that new provinces come in the framework of the proposed new constitution to reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were protests in Western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus that have their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were in violent conflicts since the 10 . &quot;
&quot; in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to as@@ sign the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very contro@@ versi@@ al issue in Nepal , which has been central for centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ors acceler@@ ated the process after the devast@@ ating earthquake that had killed in April thousands of people . &quot;
&quot; the leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ors have voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the Constitu@@ tional Court in Kathmandu and said officials , that the new constitution may come into force on Sunday . &quot;

&quot; however , it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ors now . &quot;
the project is about ten to twelve million euros ( Euro ) for months in the discussion .
&quot; some fier@@ ce reactions among sea acqu@@ isi@@ ans who had arrived at the meeting , the images and new details were to the designated hotel building . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , sea @-@ owner and manager at the pro@@ visional residence of the An@@ lieg@@ er , Pro H@@ ieve , indic@@ ted , &quot; &quot; this becomes a giant cl@@ ot@@ illa , which is over@@ rag@@ ed all other bush@@ es . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , he fears like et@@ ail other project cri@@ tic that the traffic by the intended size of the plant would increase : &quot; there must be whole buses , so that the anticip@@ ation will be calculated &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens exactly on the good a acres of large area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator .
&quot; first , we must have a logical concept , &quot; said Ralf B@@ ehr@@ ends . &quot;

Google start dou@@ bling donations campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
&quot; Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . o ) announced a dou@@ bling @-@ donations campaign to which 11 million dollar spent on humanitarian agencies , which will mig@@ rate thousands of refugees , which trans@@ ush@@ ed by the European nations , as they fle@@ e from the war of tor@@ n and im@@ po@@ ver@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an unusual personal approach from the announcements of the don@@ ating call on his blog .
&quot; rather than letting one manager make the announcement make , Rita M@@ oud , a Google assistant who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , about their personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; to our trip many dark railway and bus trips , as fam@@ ine , thir@@ st , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refu@@ gee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are des@@ perate to help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four non @-@ profitable organisations seeking help refugees and migrants : doctors Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees . &quot;
&quot; Google said that the first global donations collected , up to a value of 5.5 million at g@@ oogle.com / thi@@ ther , will be doubled to 11 million $ . &quot;
&quot; Europe is faced with its worst refu@@ gee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , more than 4 million people displac@@ ed this year . &quot;

for light overweight di@@ ab@@ etics can be helpful or helpful .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for mild overweight people with type 2 diabetes may last for a new study at least five years .
it is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes after the weight loss surgery longer live than those who received non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the death data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of the weight loss surgery , which wrote a editorial one of the new study in j@@ ama Surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to enlarge the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the physical ability to absor@@ b food .
&quot; over the years Adi@@ pos@@ itas operations have proven effective in treatment of type @-@ 2 diabetes , but most studies were conducted with people experiencing disease car@@ o@@ bes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain level of weight regarding size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be o@@ bes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ effek@@ t / 1@@ D0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v
&quot; for the new study the researchers in Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital Data , which they have collected since 2007 in a study and compare two kinds of obesity surgery , to medical treatments for type @-@ 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight . &quot;
&quot; the average BM@@ I among which this operation under@@ went , ank from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the BM@@ I remained with those who have not received non @-@ surgical treatments , approximately equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; in those who subj@@ ected to a surgical procedure , respectively there are 36 % the diabetes care completely and at 28 % in part . &quot;
&quot; in comparison with the medic@@ ally @-@ treated groups , the diabetes are fully solely at one percent and partly in only two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results were developed with the controls of blood pressure , the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Ch@@ olester@@ ols &quot; generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out . &quot;
the researchers also w@@ os@@ sed the patients @-@ blood levels of her@@ mo@@ ine in A@@ 1C who reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
Hä@@ mo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1C is best held by 7 percent to write the researchers .
&quot; after the surgery , the average h@@ ubs in A@@ 1C level will take about 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
however in the medical therapy group it remained stable at about 8 percent .
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as is reflected in the improved tick @-@ glob@@ als of A@@ 1C level - decreased not the mort@@ ality in five years , such as the leading researchers Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also expl@@ ores the average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the B@@ yp@@ ass Surgery Clinic had lost more weight ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14,@@ 2 kg ) , reaching bigger leg@@ ends in BM@@ I ( 7,@@ 4 % vs. 2,@@ 1 % ) and recorded a complete exit of diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16,@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show survival for surgery after five years , there are evidence of a study of he@@ avier people in Sweden that operation leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study the aid of obesity has been subj@@ ected to obesity , some 29 per cent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group , the conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study did not have an advantage for survival in the surgery @-@ patient , Black@@ stone said , it was so@@ othing for people with a BM@@ I in 35 , which are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , without increased risk of death or kid@@ ney disease , she said . &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously , once the patient is with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think that we are too long waiting until we people get to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accum@@ ulated this genetic changes that have linked their body with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot;
love @-@ history plays in the H@@ uns@@ r@@ ück
&quot; it is an issue that is currently taking care in the Bell@@ et@@ ris@@ tik today : a young lady , too short @-@ times , un@@ popular and un@@ sight@@ ly , meet after years the weak of her youth , and this fell in her in her . &quot;
so also in the recently published novel &quot; peculi@@ arities we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa bin@@ der .
&quot; beyond the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting for H@@ uns@@ mad reader , for he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot;
the full @-@ known author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could place a liter@@ ary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot take up all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refu@@ gee crisis in the Middle East . &quot;
the Tibetan @-@ Buddh@@ ist leaders called on to end the violence in the country &apos;s home countries .
the Dalai Lama talked to the problem of the long @-@ day refu@@ gee crisis to begin at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit in the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford .
he requested that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed against the interests of individual nations or even in@@ continent .
he also stressed that the reaction of the Western European countries has ad@@ here to the refu@@ gee crisis but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama in Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to get out of the crisis , he stressed that it is only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousands of refugees , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as a real peace and genuine development , mainly by education , for these Muslim countries can be created &quot; , &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we must think about how the killing in their countries is reduced . &quot;
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and commented that George B@@ ush@@ s action after the terrorist attack of September 11 and brought out that the violent reaction of the US moved a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my subsi@@ am in a letter to President Bush and I said to him , the way to resolve this problem lies in non @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his moti@@ ves were good , but he set violence one , and this has un@@ expected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four@@ fold increase of intake of tra@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the past 4 years
&quot; po@@ ison construction centres in the US report a nearly 400 @-@ owned increase in the number of children under twelve years , swal@@ low al@@ coho@@ lic pal@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , such as Georgia po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia po@@ ison Center , sti@@ cking the cases of revenues of manual dis@@ inf@@ ants in children under 12 years , the po@@ ison construction centres , from 3,@@ 266 to 2010 on 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are increasingly frequent to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the not@@ ation , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
he said that some children can drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants while some are doing to im@@ press their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in social media .
show videos on YouTube such as young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants can only drink because of a cheap experiences .
youths have suppos@@ edly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant with al@@ soft mouth@@ wash in order to obtain a t@@ oug@@ her be@@ verage .
younger children can become an attractive sc@@ ents of the dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are par@@ ables .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant with stra@@ w@@ berry , grap@@ e and orange juice , which are very pleas@@ ing for children . &quot;
the dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant means anywhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
particularly in inf@@ ants can have a few sp@@ lash for alcohol ad@@ oxi@@ fication .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; told Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , medical director of the Gi@@ ft@@ able Centre in the Hospital of K@@ ansas , the Sender Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you would not let him get around whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children and when children come from it , then it &apos;s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell is a six @-@ year @-@ year girl who recently taken four sy@@ ring@@ es from after stra@@ w@@ berry dis@@ inf@@ ants in school was taken into a not@@ ation of treatment .
&quot; its blood @-@ soft concentration was 179 , twice higher than the thres@@ hold , which is sec@@ lud@@ ed by an adult , Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , who treated them in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlan@@ ta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah stran@@ gen@@ te her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency .
&quot; doctors survi@@ ved them over night in a separate children &apos;s detached house on signs of deer trau@@ ma , since the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had pun@@ ished the head , &quot; Rit@@ ch@@ ey said . &quot;
&quot; that was very fri@@ ght@@ ening , &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fat@@ al for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ al@@ coho@@ lic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
about alcohol ad@@ diction amounts and some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
&quot; in 2013 , two women in Ontario , women died after the g@@ low of hand@@ tra@@ des@@ inf@@ ants , which contains a toxic , un@@ declared ingredi@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; health authorities susp@@ ect that the product meth@@ anol contained the product meth@@ anol contained , a dead@@ ly solution , instead of eth@@ yl@@ al@@ coho@@ lic , which was not@@ ated as an active ingredi@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; in January the three students of the fourth class in the State of New York , their &quot; &quot; chis@@ eled &quot; &quot; cour@@ ageous to spend their &quot; &quot; teacher products around the Classroom &quot; , &quot; so there is a police report . &quot;
the cur@@ ator is highly allergic to de@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and h@@ ears them out of their space .
the police considered the ver@@ ac@@ claimed plan as &quot; proj@@ ective &quot; and subsequently un@@ discipl@@ ined measures to the school authorities .

&quot; there are rum@@ ors about D@@ ish@@ ar@@ mon@@ y in Celtic Gl@@ oria , which was spontaneous from Griff@@ i@@ ths spont@@ ane@@ ously . this consi@@ sted that he and his team mates are not under increased control , as they prepare themselves for the confrontation with the Dutch shar@@ eholder . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t believe that we feel under pressure , I think that players are looking forward to it . &quot;
the lack of cover competition in the Scottish @-@ contest te@@ as - de Bo@@ er
the former rank @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national @-@ players of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er has said that Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic there are no titles @-@ ri@@ val@@ ry with the leader@@ boards .
&quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an amb@@ assador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland do not show any highlights in the Celtic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the leader@@ boards are not there .
people here are talking about the return of the leader@@ boards .
you are talking about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk together about both teams and that is what they are interested .
there are a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m Games and there are not only the people of Scotland who want to see these games .
&quot; I will take the things around , swe@@ ar D@@ ei@@ la . &quot;
&quot; R@@ onny D@@ ei@@ la has accepted that Celtic ass@@ ures will fight , but the Norwegian chef sw@@ ans to turn things rot@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the following dischar@@ ge from the Champions League , the defeat was followed against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which are now standing at the top of the table with five points ahead . &quot;
&quot; but he said , &quot; &quot; Celtic already had bad times before , and we will come again . &quot;
now we want to come out as quickly as possible .
&quot; I know it is very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;
we feel that exactly - but we need to go forward .
&quot; we really need , really the support of Celtic because that makes the player better . &quot;
together we are so important .

unemployment in Scotland will remain unchanged while it rises in the United Kingdom .
&quot; unemployment in Scotland stayed unchanged at 16@@ 4.000 , while the number of people without working for the UK as a whole was in the same period for 10,000 to 1,@@ 82 million . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.4 percent was about the U@@ KS by 5.5 per cent as shown the figures of the Office of National Statis@@ tics ( ons ) .
&quot; in the meantime , the employment in Scotland fell to 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2.@@ 6@@ ,000 . &quot;

why I will be witnesses of an ex@@ revolution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; later today , except during a late legal intervention , I will see how a guy is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; if it happens , and I hope it is not going to sit , I will sit in an audience &apos;s gallery at the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary if Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is ex@@ tri@@ c@@ ated by the tox@@ ins . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
&quot; the invitation was already made for the first time in January on his best friend , and although I was shock@@ ed , I vote . &quot;
&quot; when the day came closer , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good opportunity to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists will be able to see in the USA , and there are often more applications available than places available , there will be a fl@@ aw@@ less lot@@ tery instead of deciding who is elected . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media outlets from 12 to five .
who is chosen will it observe it em@@ usi@@ ve .
I cannot do this .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps nar@@ do with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with teleph@@ ones and a double and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often lau@@ gh a lot if we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it won &apos;t be allowed to carry a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma would blame me on Twitter , my im@@ parti@@ ality . &quot;
here is the lesson .
&quot; tell the story of the prison@@ er , as he wants , and you will get access . &quot;
I set me with her .
&quot; it sp@@ elled that they could have &quot; it better form@@ ulate &quot; , &quot; but it still thinks that it is wrong , what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I would not do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants that an international repor@@ ter is present to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that the public relations is going to help the movement against the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , is sitting next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the event , please hear the series of pod@@ casts that I have done . &quot;
I will not want to go again here again .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is inno@@ cent .
his acts according to the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of a benefici@@ ary of reality .
yet I believe that a strong lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood is that he is not guilty of the mur@@ derer .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justi@@ fy a death .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective I will see him dying .
I can not claim to be truly objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters to which you can contact for this .
&quot; what you will get from me , is what it means to die for a man a un@@ necessary death . &quot;
man after dam@@ p police officers late pass from the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman stayed dry when he spoke the man from the C@@ anning River .
&quot; an attempt to find a man of Per@@ th , the police was un@@ successful , was un@@ successful when he was located in the sei@@ zed and sw@@ amp@@ en water , a few meters from a police force , tried to get him easy to over@@ talk to the bank . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called on Tuesday to a hom@@ ey quar@@ ry in Beck@@ en@@ ham .
&quot; when they discovered the sus@@ pic@@ ion , they tried to escape them towards the C@@ anning River . &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I come not out , come com@@ m and ho@@ l me , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Sh@@ and@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; con@@ dom Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic to make his uni@@ fied ass , therefore he turned into a reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman is negoti@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;

Peter Moody claims that stew@@ ards were seeking to dis@@ close him and threat@@ ens the racing sport
&quot; Peter Moody claims that Stew@@ ards from Racing Victoria have tried to install a spy on his st@@ ables , and dro@@ w@@ ned the race at once . &quot;
&quot; he moved to the stew@@ ards and the integration department of Racing Victoria and asser@@ ted that they conducted a personal campaign against him with the runner Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , the last St@@ roh@@ hal@@ m on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moody &apos;s Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tries to do what is best for racing sport and he found himself under difficult conditions , when it was about the positive Kob@@ old t@@ amp@@ le test in Li@@ dar@@ is he could not explain . &quot;
&quot; he held back 18 months because of the pi@@ on@@ age occur@@ rence , and didn &apos;t want it to see how to highly pad@@ ding grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have long been s@@ essed with it , but sometimes you &apos;re so frustr@@ ated that everything will come out once , &quot; &quot; said ch . &quot;
they know that it continued .
&quot; sometimes you are responding to and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said . &quot;
I will go home ton@@ ight and sleep well .
&quot; I want to move to the main point , and I want my owners think that I try my best for her . &quot;
&quot; when they start thinking , I do not do that , then I should not be more trainers . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; previously , Moody &apos;s bom@@ b had to be high in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integration department had tried to watch its stones . &quot;
&quot; before eight@@ een months ago , Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr Brian Stew@@ art in a room with a man - I &apos;d be asked - and offered him a job in my stack , to provide information about what I do within my stack , &quot; &quot; said Moody on Rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they evi@@ d@@ ently believe that I am a sc@@ amm@@ ers .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly imp@@ ose about their n@@ oses , because they have at the attempt to summar@@ ize me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , eh@@ em . Chairman of the RV@@ L , David Moo@@ y , acting president of the RV@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ und@@ ry , current CEO of the RV@@ L , were aware of this time and still are still today . &quot;
should I bring this to the view that it is personally ?
has the RV@@ L mo@@ w himself and makes people responsible for what is in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
perhaps people out there that I am .
&quot; perhaps they must take me my license and rep@@ el me , and I have no doubt that what I say , they can now think about it . &quot;
&quot; but I have now arrived at the point where I didn &apos;t matter , and this makes me sad . &quot;
this really makes me sad .
&quot; I will exercise the pressure on them , and will push it to make a decision . &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the fruit @-@ level of the trainer have established itself with the long @-@ lasting Kob@@ old investigation into Li@@ dar@@ i , and the ate Scr@@ at@@ ching resulted in that he could throw his license over the table . &quot;
&quot; Moody , best known for his preparation of the un@@ trained Masters Black Vodka , the race @-@ treatment situation is &quot; ridi@@ cul@@ ous &quot; after a pack mud or sound had been introduced to the rac@@ tors , as opposed to the rules . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot;
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has mist@@ ak@@ enly , on the leg . &quot;
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it could have been so yesterday the day that was so .
it was also so on the race day .
&quot; Moody could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the package on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened . &quot;
it is a joke .
people who set these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see one that we need rules but here is too far too far &quot; &quot; said Moody . &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ am@@ y propos@@ es against ri@@ vals because of claims to ring ri@@ val back
Melbourne Storm Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ am@@ y made criticism of the T@@ ackl@@ ing of his player as an &quot; agenda setting &quot; of two Premier League Review of the NR@@ W .
Sydney Roo@@ sters Trainer T@@ ent Rob@@ inson said that the refer@@ ee will allowed the CM @-@ players &quot; Ring@@ struggles &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in Sydney qualifying finale in Sydney on Fri@@ day@@ evening .
&quot; Bris@@ bane Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne B@@ enn@@ ett made a little conc@@ e@@ aled note to the Storm Team , after his team scor@@ ed the final victory against North Queensland Cow@@ boys on Satur@@ days evening . he called the game a &quot; &quot; exempl@@ ary &quot; &quot; of Rugby , and said that the two from Queensland not &quot; too good &quot; in Ram@@ ingen . &quot;
Bell@@ am@@ y def@@ ects the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said that they &apos;re concentrated on the backl@@ ash only on their &quot; contact . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ am@@ y added that criticism of two leading trainers at his team make him confident , since it was worried that they were worried they were worried , from the Storm Team . &quot;
&quot; that emerg@@ es again - I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Rob@@ inson about Ring@@ struggles said , when she told us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ am@@ y on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we have changed anything in our defen@@ sive system or techniques over the whole year , but over the last six weeks we have made our contact with T@@ ackl@@ es to a real emphasis , and this has provided us with us . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not getting acc@@ ust@@ omed to losing it , so it was a little shock for him . &quot;
it is already funny to do this time again and again at this season .
&quot; Bell@@ am@@ y has attacked the &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; and remin@@ ded of his ment@@ or that B@@ enn@@ ett St George Ill@@ awar@@ ra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football . &quot;
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he was compared to the evening on Satur@@ days evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; said Bell@@ am@@ y . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 , St George was cri@@ tici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said that he will take care of it . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and see it as an exciting game , especially its young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game that you want to play when you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt , making them how they can play . &quot;
&quot; there is a stronger trust because they say these things , because they are a bit worried about us playing . &quot;
they did not think about six weeks ago when it was the Big Games .
Bell@@ am@@ y also pointed out that the game Storm hits a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I have not seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts at our game , but is it an exciting game ? &quot;
or do breaks all and do not have any points any wing@@ ed ?
for me it is the schedul@@ es .
&quot; when they mention us , it means that in a phase it is still going to meet . &quot;
&quot; the Storm team released this weekend free , as they have won the right , either North Queensland Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks next morning to receive at the Final in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales will start off next morning tomorrow . &quot;
Ser@@ bi@@ er with 200.@@ 000 $ deposit to drug an@@ kl@@ age
&quot; a man who could possibly have a life @-@ long punishment threatened in the possession of 40 kil@@ ograms Kok@@ ain which was bra@@ ked by Queensland , was released according to Queensland , was released against a deposit of 200,000 each . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police took 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , launched by South America on V@@ anu@@ atu , and in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c has been observed , as he met his fellow @-@ def@@ endants in the resort and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police took 40 kil@@ ograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo . &quot;
&quot; despite an maybe liv@@ able punishment for attempt to possess a commercial quantity of co@@ ca@@ ine , argu@@ ing the law@@ yer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the café has been for a harm@@ less reason . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supre@@ me Court of Justice , Peter F@@ ag@@ an , was worried about the flight danger at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday . &quot;
at the p@@ ign@@ ite he made the police about his place of residence .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic@@ s mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to achieve his release .
&quot; after reading the di@@ still@@ ed explanations of the two people , it is clear that the issue of a security of 200,000 dollars will be a real financial burden , &quot; said judge j@@ ag@@ an . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not be sufficient to dism@@ iss him from it , he war@@ ned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c has been released against Cau@@ tion , under the conditions that he announces his Australian and his Ser@@ bian pass , in the police daily and with@@ drew to a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;

&quot; H@@ og@@ g asser@@ ted then to the officials that he did it , since it would lead to &quot; p@@ ha@@ oph@@ ile in the internet &quot; and he then , &quot; a polic@@ eman is to be afraid to sc@@ are her . &quot;

&quot; he gave to that the sear@@ ches were performed on the computer from him , but said , whether he wanted to claim a policy is to be a polic@@ eman to fri@@ ght@@ y . &quot;
he asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him pictures and he asked to send more photos .
he said that he did so to praise them .
&quot; he said he is sick in his head , when he drinks , and said he wants to see the pictures of r@@ ape and murder . &quot;

sm@@ user switches on small border crossing to Germany
more and more refugees are taken away from the large contro@@ versi@@ al points on the German @-@ Austrian border .

on Friday we will once again look back the sun again .
the mass makes it : every two years the Motor@@ Show at the I@@ AA show its novel@@ ties .
2015 is primarily a movement from the comp@@ actor to find themselves particularly well for sale .
cars from the compact class are currently in demand particularly : approximately 28.@@ 1 per cent of new registr@@ ations were falling according to power@@ train stations ( KBA ) alone in August on this segment .
this is also reflected on the I@@ AA ( publication from 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; between all the fut@@ uris@@ tic concepts , and new ar@@ kl@@ ace and luxury cars are presented this year mainly a lot of new compact models . &quot;
one of the largest pre@@ m@@ ing for the German auto industry is in the Opel Astr@@ a who will stand in autumn with the dealers .
&quot; the Astr@@ a is an extremely important model for us , &quot; &quot; said Opel leader Karl @-@ Thomas Neum@@ ann at the show . &quot;
it belongs to the heart of the brand .
&quot; as a result , the volume model is also well sold , the new Astr@@ a will not be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel represents entry below the largest competi@@ tor VW Golf in view , which starts at 17 650 Euro . &quot;
the current astronom@@ y will cost from 16 990 Euros .
the Astr@@ a is available with a new 1 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 HP .
&quot; in addition , the H@@ esse also offer further diesel and gas@@ oline engines of 70 kW / 95 HP to 147 kW / / 200 bh@@ p to which also include three @-@ cy@@ lin@@ ders for the first time . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors , VW Golf and Ford Focus there is the Opel Astr@@ a first just as fifth . &quot;
&quot; as a second variant will follow the spring of the com@@ bi , which is already visible on the I@@ AA . &quot;
and what is going to be upgra@@ ded by the Astr@@ a at the I@@ AA or new comp@@ actor ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astr@@ a @-@ competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e in the race .
at the trade fair the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively as fifth and an emphas@@ izes sporting GT @-@ version .
&quot; at the beginning of next year , he will come as a com@@ bi . &quot;
infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is the infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan exhau@@ st wants to find his position in the strong growing segment with the new model .
&quot; thereby , the compact infin@@ iti is adapting to its cur@@ ved lines full into the design line of the brand . &quot;
the basic model will get a gas@@ oline engine with a power of at least 90 kW / 122 HP .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 HP or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Suzuki Bal@@ ous : new in the segment is also the Suzuki Bal@@ eno who celeb@@ rates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
&quot; the model is offered with gas@@ oline engines , including a newly developed 1,0 @-@ liter Tur@@ bom@@ ot@@ or and an output of 82 kW / 111 PS . &quot;
the maximum torque is given by manufactur@@ er@@ dia at 170 New@@ ton@@ meters ( Nm ) .

J@@ VA Berlin @-@ T@@ egel : five square meters cells are human @-@ worthy
&quot; the Bundes@@ verfassungs@@ gericht has entered into a Ex @-@ her@@ ence of the judi@@ ciary in prison , the mon@@ ately was accommod@@ ated in one to small cell . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners have generally entitled to financial compensation if they are contained in small cells . &quot;
this decision has decided the Federal Constitu@@ tional Court in a decision on Wednesday .
those affected can even then blame the judges even if they were locked only a few days in the rooms ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 112@@ 7 / 14 ) .
&quot; this was a ex @-@ det@@ ention with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe : he was placed in the Judi@@ ciary of Berlin @-@ T@@ egel , between June and November 2009 in a single cell with around five square meters floor . the toilet was tempor@@ arily non @-@ separated . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man , who is now on an open foot according to the information of his law@@ yer , had been converted into a larger cell . &quot;
his am@@ nest@@ ing coll@@ age because of the un@@ worthy liability conditions against the country of Berlin on the ground .
&quot; however , the Constitu@@ tional rec@@ tors sh@@ iel@@ ded the ver@@ dict of the Kam@@ mer@@ ich Berlin , and reported the case to the renewed examination . &quot;
you can see human dignity that the man has been viol@@ ated .
Kam@@ mer@@ el now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons of the frag@@ ment period only a few days of liability for the compensation shall be decisive , be a compensation . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; a shor@@ ten@@ ening of the legal protection of the personality would be to fear . &quot;
the Cam@@ u@@ y must now be clari@@ fying the amount of the injury .
the det@@ ectors have often been reinforced in the past often the rights of criminal prisoners .
they said that they were only in April of a prison@@ er , because he was bare in a cell in a cell . &quot;
&quot; man@@ at@@ rust@@ worthy is a decision of 2011 , but also the multi @-@ occupation of a cell without a separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , on Wednesday also confirmed the Berliner Constitu@@ tional Court , which had an in@@ dig@@ nation in a parallel in November 2009 . &quot;
&quot; over three months , the former Kl@@ äger soldiers had been shel@@ tered from 15 to 21 hours in a similar cell , like in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case . &quot;
the Berlin pris@@ ons have also come into the head@@ lines for the last few weeks .
&quot; prisoners are therefore always en@@ closed for 23 hours , the ag@@ gres@@ siv@@ ity is rising , even to sacrifice , it is said to be already on the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; according to information of the Judi@@ th@@ pressor bases , 21 bodies in T@@ egel because of post @-@ sub@@ missions are not occupied , 19 are to fall away in 2016 . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refu@@ gee policy : &quot; we create that &quot;
the immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers are coming to Germany according to forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Finance to Germany , after a statement by vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany even is able to absor@@ b a million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated with the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can create that and we create that . &quot;
what comes to Germany is im@@ part@@ ing the following overview .
&quot; are needed after different forecasts between 35@@ 0000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of State ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) , every year - and over the next five years . &quot;
that &apos;s almost twice as much as previously it is built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
&quot; dramatic is the lack of living space , but above all on pay@@ able items : yearly from 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social housing from the flat delivery , and around these particularly cheap apartments will also apply to refugees . &quot;
&quot; Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SD@@ P ) wants to double double the promotion , from now 518 million at a billion euros . &quot;
&quot; much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing , would have to develop and would have to invest in funding from 6,@@ 4 billion per year . &quot;
scientists and foreign ministers have agreed that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in residential construction .
&quot; according to the Institute for labour market research , research and vocational training is to be limited to 55 percent of the refugees in Germany over the long term . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the refugees in Germany wouldn &apos;t be systematically asked about their qualification to help them start with her , critic@@ ised Claudia Walter , project management for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
but for the integration of refugees it is decisive whether they can work in Germany .
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the esteem in the centre @-@ society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the refu@@ ge , says Mig@@ rant Diet@@ rich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , it had given a political shift to the throne in Germany : from labour ban for refugees to recognition of work . &quot;
&quot; while there was a working ban for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years ago , this month was reduced to three months , just as the residen@@ ces imposed by asylum seek@@ ers to a place of residence . &quot;
&quot; in society - also because of the lack of qualified labour @-@ projects , the view of refugees should be transparent to the labour market . &quot;
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are lack of knowledge .
&quot; up until now , there is no preced@@ ented programme of general and occupational @-@ related language courses . &quot;
studies also show that jobs are most often used by personal contacts .
&quot; therefore , construction of networks is therefore a view to the Thr@@ än@@ hardt of the König@@ s@@ weg path . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin school administration has established that only a few refugees can give their children to the Kit@@ as , roughly ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the root @-@ root@@ ed parents , it is only once more important to keep the family , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ en , speaker for youth and family in the Berlin Sen@@ ate administration . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , to convince the family nevertheless the advantages of the cl@@ ita , the administration of hand@@ z@@ ett@@ el distributed in various languages . &quot;
&quot; should the need for educ@@ ators increase greatly by the great number of refugees , the Berlin Sen@@ ate would attempt to increase the training capacity - about by increasing more colleges . &quot;
in the countries students are prepared in teaching courses at the classes .
&quot; but they are not always taught by fully trained teacher and teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers , who only have qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; in them there is no def@@ ect , he says Beate St@@ einer from the Berlin school administration . &quot;
Deutsche Stud@@ enten@@ werk appreciate about 20 percent of refugees trying to study refugees in Germany .
&quot; basically , no state asylum seek@@ ers or tra@@ dul@@ ated the study - the only exception was so far Berlin , inside Frank H@@ enk@@ el ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned its position . &quot;
student &apos;s student could be facilit@@ ated to the university &apos;s education .
&quot; for refugees with a rei@@ m@@ bur@@ sement or down@@ s do not receive any achievements after the asylum @-@ performance law , if they start studies . &quot;
&quot; the latter always won &apos;t be an BA@@ Fö@@ G , as it will not fall under the circle of hi@@ af@@ tive persons . &quot;
&quot; in so far , refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to have been eligible for BA@@ Fö@@ G will have to shor@@ ten this sp@@ anne to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but also these funding gap must be closed , but Steff@@ en Kra@@ ch , Berlin , State Secretary for Science , and the German Stud@@ enten@@ werk . &quot;
the students should immediately get BA@@ Fö@@ G .
&quot; in future , Islam will continue to play a more important role as many refugees are Muslims and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should succ@@ essi@@ vely the same rights in Islam , as they have the churches , and to develop the existing state @-@ churches right to a new state of religions . &quot;
&quot; important would also be the founding of a Islamic welfare state , which takes care of its re @-@ cur@@ ling . &quot;
on the Rights are also obligations .
&quot; in this way , the representatives of Islam will have to be clear and ready to work with the state in many areas and to provide certain control options . &quot;
&quot; this includes the willingness , to go on against religious fundament@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ e@@ k , vo@@ ic@@ ed on Thursday the concern , religious conflicts may also be registered after Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who want to carry such conflicts in Germany now have immediately their right to stay here , in Germany , he said , &quot; he said in the Bay@@ an Rund@@ funk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law on Arab .
&quot; in future , integration will continue to be a topic of the whole society today . &quot;
&quot; this way , the majority of society must change , dis@@ man@@ t@@ ling the reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; as a result of European decisions - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ dis@@ crimin@@ atory and a general gender assessment agency for a decade . &quot;
&quot; but it learn very slowly , like the NS@@ U m@@ ord@@ al series showed , systematically ignor@@ es the rac@@ ist mot@@ if . &quot;
&quot; equal opportunities for all : what mig@@ rant organisations and stakeholders are already long calling for international agreements like the Anti @-@ rass@@ is@@ mus@@ Convention Centre , must be realised in the coming years if the country will remain peaceful and take advantage of its new citizens - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is able to support the previously expected refugees medic@@ ally , the doctor director Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gomery . &quot;
&quot; regarding both Man@@ - Power and capacities , we create it , &quot; he said the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , it is possible to flow additional money into the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , calls Mont@@ gomery , all acqu@@ isi@@ tions equal to the registration of health cards . &quot;
services could be calculated later with the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; in the long term , it is highly question@@ able , so many people with the limited @-@ performance catalog , which I see the asylum @-@ power law . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , to make the doctors above all the language barriers . &quot;
&quot; previously , so far the Berlin health scientists The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven , migrants are worse about their disease than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , also in doctors must also need interpre@@ ter costs , call them . &quot;
he would also be helped by many refugees but also with more gener@@ alli@@ ances in the emergency ad@@ patient out@@ patient .
and with a different diagnostic view .
&quot; amongst the refu@@ gee camps , about I give it significantly more untreated disabilities , and in the young people it is about HIV @-@ enlight@@ enment . &quot;
&quot; in some other cases , German doctors were reported by their education but clearly , Mont@@ gomery . &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ites or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not so hard to recognize . &quot; and what affects the sleeve &apos;s blood , either by the refugees may even alle@@ vi@@ ate alle@@ viation in sight . &quot;
the Syri@@ ans would have a high @-@ developed educational system , et@@ een refugees even doctors . &quot;
&quot; to practice , they would have to dism@@ iss their qualification and to take part again . &quot;
&quot; at least half of the population in Germany against the Federal Republic of Refugees ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) psych@@ ologically , most suffer from one post@@ injury or depres@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; very vulnerable , refu@@ gee rights , explained Diet@@ rich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recent study of the Technical University Munich proves that every five Norwegian refu@@ gee camps are traum@@ atis@@ ed in Germany .
&quot; who is suffering from a post@@ injury , suffering from other things to so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with respir@@ atory , di@@ z@@ zin@@ ess , heart and death . &quot;
&quot; further symptoms are ins@@ - and cont@@ amination , strong shock resistance and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent the symptoms of chronic would be chronic , be an early treatment needed , explained Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; until now , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically cranes are given a psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; indeed , psych@@ ologically cranes that can put an application for psych@@ otherapy , but the processing usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social welfare , we are mostly deb@@ tors or doctors who are not trained for the psych@@ ic diseases , whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often lead to failure , says Mun@@ z . &quot;

Sim@@ bab@@ w@@ es Robert M@@ ug@@ abe holds wrong speech in parliament
&quot; Mr M@@ ug@@ abe , African Anci@@ ent Guide , fell down the stairs at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ inj@@ ured , but the video of the case quickly spread across the social media . &quot;
&quot; the opening of the Parliament was also dec@@ ei@@ ved by declar@@ ations of the members of the opposition , that they had obtained anonymous deaths and war@@ ned them to accompany the submission of Mr M@@ ug@@ ello with rep@@ tiles . &quot;
last month they had spread it and interrupted him during his speech to the Nation of State in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spok@@ es@@ person of the movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese told that seven Op@@ ole politicians can have received SMS messages on their mobil@@ es that they were war@@ ned to inter@@ f@@ ere Mr. M@@ ug@@ ab@@ it &apos;s speech .

H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will extend up to 30.000 jobs
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build 25@@ ,000 to 30.000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and savings efforts at the company &apos;s services . &quot;
HP is later split up later this year in two decades of companies and the computer and printer business separate from its fast growing company hardware and its service activities .
&quot; expected job placement is leading to a burden of over 2,@@ 7 billion dollars in the fourth quarter , told HP in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; this restructuring measures will enable a competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chair and Chief Executive , which should lead the unity of separation . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise is smaller and stronger than it is HP today , and we have a broad and deep@@ est portfolio of shops that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
as an independent company we are better placed than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion US dollars and &quot; will be focused on providing un@@ reachable , integrated technology solutions for companies &quot; , &quot; such an explanation of the company . &quot;
&quot; it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s , from the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard , in order to manufacture an elec@@ tro @-@ systems and their Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of the Sili@@ con Valley &quot; . &quot; &quot;
HP has a massive restructuring run to cope with the conversion of traditional PCs towards mobile devices .
&quot; the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the biggest US @-@ tech companies , is the most recent in this field that is based on the conviction that closely foc@@ uss@@ ed companies achieve a better performance . &quot;
&quot; FC Arsen@@ al , Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ates ahead of the game against dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere &quot;
&quot; stres@@ sing about Wil@@ sh@@ ere , that it was only September and provided his rehabilitation to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play before Christmas again . &quot;
&quot; this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will be sure to miss the next four games for England and in view of its history , his participation in the next summer is certainly still un@@ certain . &quot;
&quot; the great shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate no@@ ble damage , and then back to its old sw@@ elling during the pre @-@ season . &quot;
&quot; this kind of injury is not threat@@ ening the career , &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
it is a bone that is not good healing .
it is not a big issue .
this was just an accident .
it did not stand in conjunction with his an@@ kl@@ es or with the inj@@ uries that he had previously had .
&quot; it might be true of purely medic@@ ally sight , but like W@@ enger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further inj@@ uries , always when a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it is also developing a pleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd is listed 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut in six years ago .
&quot; he also played in only 65 of ar@@ sen@@ al , 157 Lig@@ asp@@ ing in the last five seasons . &quot;
&quot; the broader picture for ar@@ sen@@ al is that in six out of eight players , since 2007 / 08 one of the two Premier League &apos;s clubs were having those of most vulner@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; W@@ enger accepts the potential of a devil , but ar@@ sen@@ al believes that an improvement in the inj@@ uries rate during the last season will last . &quot;
&quot; sometimes when you return from an injury , you have a chance period , a time in which you have to strengthen your body and gain popularity &quot; , &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zed , I am confident that he will do it and he will make a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
ar@@ sen@@ al begins his Champions League tournament on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham hot@@ sp@@ ur in the coming Wednesday and W@@ enger introduces a rotation within the team .
&quot; H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelled to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start . &quot;
W@@ enger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gi@@ b@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and The@@ o wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and the players who need it to have a little break @-@ up , &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
&quot; although ar@@ sen@@ al favor@@ ites , through group F progress , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the largest in@@ tim@@ id@@ tim@@ ents in Europe . &quot;
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ be@@ aten to 41 games after the &quot; Un@@ defe@@ ated &quot; campaign started in the last season .
&quot; the stadium was sh@@ aken on Tuesday evening by an earthquake , where on the Rich@@ ter@@ sk@@ ala 3,@@ 2 judged . &quot;
this year it was the 10th place in Zagreb .
&quot; W@@ enger is the opinion that ar@@ sen@@ al has drawn the teaching from the past season with the Champions League sur@@ render to Monaco , and will remain driven by far hope , with his management the association to his first Europ@@ ap@@ ok@@ al tri@@ umph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
it has never worked at ar@@ sen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
we are ambitious but we are not dre@@ amer .
Friend@@ s@@ fest : the comedy @-@ show that gives us serious lessons for men &apos;s friend@@ ships !
&quot; the absence of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up , now even more des@@ perate than ever happened to be asser@@ ted by young men at a 15 year . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important dead@@ lines in men at the age of 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains more common in men than among women . &quot;
&quot; to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ anes ( calm - campaign against a her@@ edi@@ t@@ ary life ) 2015 as the year of the man , with the goal to ask the culture to ask for help to seek help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the struggle to tackle this challenge .
&quot; a recent study with more than 2,000 high @-@ School students with depres@@ sive symptoms show that when the suffer@@ er had a sufficient high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy atmosphere , &quot; his chances of recovery . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , half a circle of mental healthy friends the risks of mental problems . &quot;
but of course you have to have friends to work with them .
&quot; in the age of more than social media , with its focus on style about substance , the im@@ min@@ e@@ ability of response often is more important than a significant contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital lives have the need to appear strong , funny and successful , even if in reality the isolation dominated . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by which psych@@ ologists ex@@ tr@@ ins@@ ical values name ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trinsic values - our inner long@@ ing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper . &quot;
&quot; and as stated a video play invent@@ ors and billi@@ on@@ aire recently , money can really not buy luck . &quot;
&quot; the Beautiful at Friends , was that this focus was placed on the head . &quot;
&quot; every character has not been defined by his work , but defined by his personality by inter@@ acting as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent h@@ ugs , Mom@@ ents at football in cozy arm@@ chairs and the long@@ ing from R@@ oss to Rachel - all that came out of the knowledge that men can definitely look back , even if they often keep their feelings aw@@ aken . &quot;
&quot; how an employee of telephone calls it to me : ... &quot; my audience &apos;s role for people who feel depres@@ sive and are self @-@ vulnerable , has really shown me clearly how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
&quot; the men who contact us feel often not able to talk with friends . &quot;
&quot; the old waste &quot; I come to cope with it &quot; &quot; has a tremendous impact on how the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if you talk about problems openly . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to me when I try to offer long @-@ term admir@@ ation mechanisms .
they clearly presents the little moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
&quot; as very my objective out@@ sider status on the phone to look at eye levels of des@@ per@@ ation may also help , the long term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , if you come at this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ fest with the celebration of the day completely newly designed setting , why not take your friends a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better if you look around in Star@@ bu@@ cks person alone , give him a smile and say hello . &quot;
one never knows what difference your friendship could make .
friends will send at Com@@ edy Central from the beginning - the whole 236 episode - for # Friend@@ s@@ fest
&quot; Maria meets , to help PSG , Malm@@ ö . &quot;
angel Di Maria celeb@@ rates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Edin@@ bu@@ son Cav@@ ani after his hits against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to pass to Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
Angel Di Maria and Edin@@ bu@@ son Cav@@ ani stopped course as Paris Saint @-@ Germain des Champions League &apos;s season with a extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö at the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ stadium on Tuesday started .
&quot; Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as PSG @-@ players who brought the French master to the way , but afterwards she had increased a number of occasions before they finally achieved a head start as Cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Schach@@ tj@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k , a strong start in the group A requires a strong start against the Swedish Master , since they are not only the qualification for the N.@@ O.@@ C. Ro@@ unded , but an improvement on its way to the quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , it was not a class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ him@@ o@@ vic@@ s missed opportunities in the game against his hom@@ etown of his team and against the association , with whom he started his illustrations career in 1999 , changed . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or down@@ ward in the Champions League to win . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to capture our opponents issues and relaxed , even if there are certain things we have still perf@@ ected during the season , &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; this is a good sign .
&quot; we wanted to win and we have won , although I be@@ da@@ ure , that we have not yet scor@@ ed one or two more goals . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic is returned after his bre@@ ach in one of three changes in the Paris team who could hold a 2 : 2 Un@@ decided at his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was released in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ in@@ ean wing Y@@ est@@ mer was known as the man who became to the next stage in Europe when he was transferred to the next month of Manchester United , and he pointed out why , when he ran in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense , before it was completed at Johan Wil@@ and past beautifully in the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; however , if someone believed that there would be a great victory that was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malm@@ ö , the Celtic in a Play @-@ off hit to reach this level , entered into An@@ pi@@ ff with nine nation@@ alists on the field and was up with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle @-@ field with a severe opponent . &quot;
&quot; but besides a shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ amar@@ dj@@ ic , which contributed far to Kevin Tr@@ acer P@@ fo@@ sten at the 34@@ th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , many even gave themselves sometimes , with some mis@@ ses and bad degrees , not least of I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , who was abandoned with no less than five sellers alone in the first half , and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had taken him after the rest@@ art . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless he pointed out much more to the game , when he brought his fellow @-@ players to the game , and it was a pass of I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , the Di Mary in a shooting , which was induc@@ ed by Wil@@ and in the 52@@ th minute ... &quot;
the second gate finally fell short after the hours of st@@ amp thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Uruguay ay@@ er showed it his six@@ teenth Sa@@ is@@ ont@@ or after I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic had had a left side of Max@@ well .
&quot; this ended up all thoughts about that Malm@@ ö can come back into the game , and just stop a splendid operation of Wil@@ and from the short@@ est removal to David Lu@@ iz , the end result could be low before the replacement player E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi has been recognized by the end . &quot;
&quot; the trainer from Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ eide , announced that in a class on his team , and the Norwegian said , &quot; &quot; our last Champions League game was last year . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have played only in the Swedish League , which did not have the same level . &quot;
the qualification rounds are not enough . &quot;
hut from above Paris !
it was a great game of them !

&quot; the competition show , which has just completed their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participants who could complete all levels of his obstacle par@@ cour@@ s . &quot;
&quot; during the seas@@ onal , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and Camer@@ am@@ ann Ge@@ off B@@ ritten , until the Fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; to the last task , the climb was on a 75 feet long climbing rope in 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; he ended the task within the time , which he ended the first athle@@ te that ended the gru@@ eling phase 4 by American N@@ in@@ ja Warrior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero concluded that challenge for full three seconds faster , which made him winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke to E ! messages after the hard fight , still under the shock on winning the big prize of 1 million $ . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it is amazing to think about it , I have never earned more than 10.000 $ , or had life , &quot; said Isaac E ! about his amount of money . &quot;

Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak at Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ POL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball than today the Tig@@ ers appear at the last place in the American League Central .
the Tig@@ ers reduced to their role as Spo@@ iler , however , played this part in the Tuesday perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 on target field . &quot;
the T@@ wins spoke a chance to climb inside a half of the Houston area Ast@@ ros for the second American League game .
&quot; Detroit , although only for an evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so difficult to grasp more than one of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all vic@@ tories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon gave his early pat@@ sive support to sustain than Detroit three times in the first two inside , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) took 6 times in the 1 / 3 inter@@ ings and made possible three of us .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year strong , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to throw in the bull@@ pen every game , and so I will go very focused in the game . &quot;
the design@@ ated tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns ; his first week since the middle of August .
&quot; it was the first three @-@ line hit by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits in the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th . &quot;
&quot; he hat@@ red the stroke well , &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( stroke training ) , looked clearly better at the bull@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three R@@ uns in the hinter@@ land at the end of the seventh inside , T@@ wins had their best chance to go back into play . &quot;
center F@@ iel@@ ding By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left field .
right F@@ iel@@ ding Aaron H@@ icks reached a hunt and Simon gave his second bas@@ eman Brian Dom@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the Lef@@ thand@@ ed Bla@@ ine Hard@@ y .
&quot; Hard@@ y went out , the only man , with which he was confronted , in front of the design@@ ated R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ dru@@ id Miguel S@@ ano , who described the rect@@ angle Dre@@ w Ver@@ h@@ agen a two @-@ run . &quot;
with a pair of run@@ ners and the closing @-@ run during the second brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ps to a double play .
it was that in the Major League &apos;s leading 27 times during this season that Pl@@ ou@@ les hit a double play .
&quot; after Detroit was added at the end of the ninth @-@ down interior , a R@@ BI pair against the C@@ loser of the tiger Bruce Ron@@ don , and recorded the booth of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; however , the right @-@ handed st@@ ools in three Pit@@ ches for its fifth Save . &quot;
Detroit benef@@ itted for the opening of the game by an still non @-@ motion Phil H@@ ugh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers scor@@ ed three of us in the first two inter@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an that had been st@@ aged before the game from the viol@@ ating list after he was missing for more than a month because of a sp@@ inal injury .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted to tell me , &quot; said Mr H@@ ugh@@ es , &quot; but I felt myself , when I was releas@@ ing and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches out there in the third in@@ ning . &quot;
&quot; after they received the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ bat@@ ter , H@@ ush@@ es gave a single onto Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
a two @-@ out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to the game that run a single &quot; up the Middle &quot; for the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 track series with the Run@@ es in the scor@@ ing position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed by a single in the right hand , made another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game as he tried to get to the third what the threat ended . &quot;
the Tig@@ ers laid out in the second scor@@ ed a one @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
he did not give particularly well be@@ aten but he has caught the right place .
&quot; H@@ ugh@@ es was found in a Pit@@ ch Coun@@ t , not scor@@ ed points in the third inning before it replaced by the rel@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter . &quot;
at H@@ ugh@@ es there came up to three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four lines .

Rome now has a Martin @-@ Lu@@ ther @-@ Platz
&quot; just under 500 years after the Reformation , there is a Martin @-@ Lu@@ ther @-@ Platz in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of Stadt@@ feld Ig@@ na@@ zio Marino , on Wednesday , an unknown place in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill was bap@@ tis@@ ed in the name of the German reform@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; it is now used as &quot; &quot; German The@@ ologist of Reformation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome right next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the Collabor@@ ation of the Protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
&quot; J@@ ens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , rec@@ tory of the Evangel@@ ical Lu@@ ther@@ an Church in Rome , remin@@ ded that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the bar@@ be@@ est over centuries as a minority could only live in secret their faith . &quot;
&quot; with the place I become visible in a symbo@@ lic manner , that their tradition of Christian faith are welcome in Rome . &quot;
Martin Lu@@ ther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was founded as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k for the annual turn 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he received the city at that time as a s@@ lau@@ ght@@ ened sin@@ den@@ man .
his negative impressions are encouraged to take him further by hist@@ orian in his later fight against Rome .
Lu@@ ther had then introduced with his Th@@ eses to the Ab@@ las@@ h@@ andel the division of the ab@@ end@@ onian church .
hammer professionals invested three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( verg@@ ol@@ ed ) Dorn@@ enk@@ rone is one of the main pieces of the Ot@@ mar old for his Bible .
Klaus Old J@@ ost has written the introduction and the Bible is updated .
at the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now appeared with splendid images . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who has form@@ ulated in 150 moti@@ fs its quite personal interpre@@ tations with Bi@@ ographical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
&quot; on the contrary , adapted to the respective topics , which can be quite correct . &quot;
&quot; about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he met a subjective artistic selection of the many theme of &quot; &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these cycles are cycles , which de@@ vote themes such as cross @-@ way , pl@@ agues , command@@ ments or f@@ ath@@ erh@@ ood . &quot;
&quot; in this way , he was fascinated spont@@ ane@@ ously compared to the Lu@@ ther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological alignment as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books . &quot;
and there is especially the author of Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost which has faced on the basis of painting with the respective Bible .
he has interpreted the Bible chosen by Ot@@ mar Alt selected Bible and so into the lo@@ ot . &quot;
these texts are as verbal mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; nestled between the original Bible Study of Martin Lu@@ ther and each one of the artist , who is form@@ ulated their personal thoughts on the particular situation here . &quot;
the jewel @-@ band has Golden Let@@ ters .
&quot; thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old is entitled to a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high level of in@@ timacy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately no trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in Wer@@ nig@@ er@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belong to the strict Protest@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter Order . &quot;
&quot; then the education already happened time with the tube , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
&quot; I have tried to asc@@ end this , to perhaps even go back with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to be more important to the art in the fast @-@ time period : &quot; &quot; the perception of image wel@@ ten is shaped today by re@@ cl@@ ame , and that is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is being pushed .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
images always have a bit secret and not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ os@@ aur . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt would like to let the spect@@ ator into the pictures &quot; lie down , &quot; they look at themselves , discover and sense the strength they have : &quot; the image looks for his counter@@ part . &quot;
&quot; finally on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art has been to be &quot; &quot; I like , how he takes life with his images . &quot;
&quot; I have not heard this to grasp the Bible completely , but the most important topics for him , too . &quot;
&quot; this was no collaboration on eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the images , the text explains merely . &quot; &quot; it was a pictures of the Bible . &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of the Lu@@ ther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Images speak for M@@ öh@@ ler ( Bi@@ b@@ lical ) language of love and responsibility .
part of the original - paper and sub@@ wall sub@@ types - is presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be launched on 15th November at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
start of the BM@@ X rail@@ ways
&quot; plans , place , companies commissioned , pe@@ dic@@ ted gel for a circular trial : one year later it was almost everything ready - but even before the official opening of the BM@@ X train already ended . &quot;
&quot; om@@ is@@ sions in politics and administration sought for pre@@ uss , especially in the residents who did not want to toler@@ ate the train . &quot;
&quot; so hill , looked up , new place - now with formal planning and application for building permit . &quot;
the permission will enter in October that the first congreg@@ ation was able to communicate with Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck now in the children &apos;s and youth affairs .
&quot; I hope that this year is still visible , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; further com@@ mem@@ oration &quot; &quot; with the works in the former indoor swimming pool . &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fied commitment to refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B keeps his commitment to refugees to 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga puts a clear sign on the weekend . &quot;
the football has re@@ acted to the situation in Germany and protects its policy from tackl@@ ing the tackl@@ ing problems .
&quot; I think this is the greatest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as a principle no one can say , this doesn &apos;t matter to me , I have nothing to do with that . &quot;
&quot; this has to be interesting to get this topic in the handle , &quot; said DF@@ B @-@ Chief Wolfgang N@@ ier@@ sbach . &quot;
at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on September 23 in Berlin he wants to discuss the refu@@ gee situation in Germany .
&quot; I am next Wednesday in the ch@@ anc@@ ellor and meeting there the Austrian Minister of Ms Ö@@ z@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the ch@@ anc@@ ellor . &quot;
&quot; that topic certainly will play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football could be f@@ ool and wants to help .
but the crucial wh@@ ist@@ les must ask the policy .
the German football association has therefore expanded his refu@@ gee @-@ initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; to four years .
&quot; about the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation , we ensured that this program continues until 2019 runs &quot; , &quot; declared N@@ ier@@ sbach on the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
even some allies support this program .
&quot; already this weekend , the 36 Profi@@ ver@@ eine is a German sign , if they will be on the left tri@@ ck@@ är@@ mel instead of the usual regular sponsorship ( Her@@ mes ) the print &quot; &quot; We help - # epp@@ ank@@ es@@ welcome &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we also want to make clear that everyone should help where and how they can &quot; , &quot; L@@ ever@@ lasting Sport@@ sman Rud@@ i V@@ ö@@ ller &quot; &quot; picture ( Tuesday ) and describes the project as &quot; self @-@ comprehen@@ sibility . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refu@@ gee @-@ drama for everyone , no one may see . &quot;
&quot; we do not know the Bundes@@ liga , no , we must use our strength , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly powerful , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
&quot; Hoff@@ mann , Peter Ret@@ ail said about a &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot; &quot;
at the EM @-@ qualification game against Hungary on this Friday charges the national team of women 100 refugees after Halle / Sa@@ ale .
N@@ ier@@ sbach had the support of refugees as a &quot; a large communal area of German football . &quot;
&quot; that every 36 roy@@ alties will have started in their own locations , be great . &quot;
&quot; it is just as great , that small and smallest clubs are active . &quot;
&quot; the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; which we spent , is used in football . &quot;
&quot; this is of huge importance , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; this year , the association provides the association with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government at 300 000 Euros for the integration of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have already called the whole total of 2015 , &quot; &quot; reported N@@ ier@@ sbach . &quot;
reports : SAP @-@ Fix@@ sch@@ ef loses an eye in an accident
&quot; the President of Europe &apos;s greatest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has been one of several reports according to a fall in early July . &quot;
&quot; at the accident at the stair@@ way in the house of his brother in the USA , he liked to midnight in the USA after midnight , which he held in the left hand , reports &quot; &quot; Economic Week &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost ble@@ eding , was impot@@ ent , then has moved out to the road - that he told us so the last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ Where &quot; SAP @-@ Co @-@ founder &quot; Has@@ suit . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could be able to do his job .
&quot; early October we meet in front of the super@@ visory meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Turn@@ ner . &quot;
the 54 year old managers are at the meeting and work fully operational . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; South German newspaper &quot; &quot; ( Thurs@@ days ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue the software group . &quot;
&quot; I am full for SAP there , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I got all the time in regular contact with the Super@@ visory Board and his president Has@@ ar plat@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t comm@@ utes between Germany and the U.S. , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; be it important to go to the public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; : &quot; everyone can happen . &quot;
&quot; important is to stand up again , if you go down . &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ replacement pilot magnesium from skir@@ mis@@ h ...

football : BV@@ B without re@@ us against Kras@@ no@@ dar : Weiden@@ er in the Tor
at Bor@@ ussia Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group game of Europe League finally cr@@ ashed .
the national @-@ player will also be missing the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga as well as in the Du@@ el with the FK Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 ) .
&quot; unfortunately we cannot draw on him , &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga team against L@@ ever@@ k@@ usen , let the BV@@ B coach was open again : &quot; we expect a return from him to training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; considering the high load of his pro@@ s , Tu@@ ch@@ el will alter its stem eleven only on the Re@@ us position . &quot;
so he announced a change on the door@@ ke@@ eper .
therefore Roman Weiden@@ er takes the place of tri@@ ke@@ eper Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trained on an absolute top level , pra@@ ised the football teacher of the world . &quot;
&quot; whether Tag@@ cloud @-@ plays in the future in all Europe League play , tu@@ ch@@ el made open . &quot;
with a high degree of probability it will also be the second game .
the for@@ got statement from fellow @-@ players re@@ us that the Fin@@ al@@ entry for BV@@ B in the Europe League will be the goal of trac@@ e@@ ego@@ ic Julian ap@@ eig@@ l for re@@ trac@@ eable : &quot; therefore Marco is not so wrong .
I think that we have a good chance to access the title .
robot@@ ic auto@@ s : government wants the lead role in Germany
&quot; Germany should be fron@@ tr@@ un@@ ner according to the will of the German government at the changes in technological technological developments . &quot;
the Bundes@@ kab@@ in@@ ett decided on Wednesday an Strateg@@ i@@ ep@@ ap@@ ier from the House of Transport Minister Alexander d@@ ob@@ r@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) which among other things investing in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; d@@ ob@@ r@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the I@@ AA of a &quot; &quot; new mobile Computer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; automated , connected driving will increase traffic security and ensure less stability , said d@@ ob@@ r@@ ind@@ t . &quot;
he also wants to discuss the subject with his counter@@ part from the G@@ 7 states focusing on the I@@ AA with representatives of the industry .
&quot; the Strateg@@ ic Ministry of Transport , inter alia , stres@@ ses the importance of mobile broad@@ band design and an outstanding transformation on digital hearing . &quot;
&quot; to testing new technology is at present a test route on the road 9 in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; so that the driver &quot; &quot; should not be added to the drivers &quot; , &quot; the federal government wants to review the legal framework conditions &quot; and , where necessary , to adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Germany wants to employ around international for the per@@ missible peak speed for self @-@ driving cars of 10 to 130 million kilometers . &quot;
&quot; the federal government is also aimed at making a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only people can see as a driver . &quot;
&quot; at an automated driving , the car takes over the leadership , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger . &quot;
&quot; the technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras , covering the environment and process the data in a period of seconds . &quot;
&quot; according to one from the Ministry of Economic Affairs , there will be a state @-@ automated driving on high@@ ways by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , hass@@ le @-@ free vehicles on public roads were only expected to be expected . &quot;
&quot; added value in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the site , the authors of the study for 2025 to around 8,@@ 4 billion euros . &quot;
&quot; the digital connectivity of the PK@@ W@@ s can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said the SPD @-@ Transport of S@@ ör@@ gy Bart@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in accidents and security of personal data of the driver must be clear . &quot;
&quot; even the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are skep@@ tical , however , - much more than French or Americans . &quot;
&quot; a survey on the AA institute of the For@@ sa institute on behalf of the Test Construction Dek@@ ra comes to the result , that only eight percent of the Germans believe that their own driving cars in the coming ten years will succeed , 31 percent do not believe in it at all . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents until 2025 was generated by aut@@ on@@ om driving cars , in the United States 33 per cent . &quot;
&quot; in any case , motor@@ ists in Germany are not yet ready to rely on a self @-@ driving vehicle . &quot;
&quot; following a collection of the Bit@@ k@@ om , Bit@@ k@@ om , would only agree with seven percent , take control throughout the ride on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the highway that might even imagine that in flowing traffic at least 15 percent , in St@@ au 45 percent . &quot;
good every v@@ elled would have left the car under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team@@ - and double @-@ start at table @-@ level EM
&quot; the Düsseldorf @-@ offering is a current state at the title , from 25 September to 4 October only in single . &quot;
the final decision should be handed down at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; but we are strongly enough , even without Tim@@ o the title &quot; , &quot; said Bundestag Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ ner during the EM @-@ tutorial in Düsseldorf . &quot;
the flight was at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsorship session .
the 34 year old German champion is expected on Friday .
&quot; without Tim@@ o is the disadvantage , we are no longer so a clear favorite , &quot; explained single @-@ European Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ ah@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; Ham@@ el@@ ner , who runs the ten@@ ant in J@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , but also remin@@ ded of the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; at that time Tim@@ o has also been missing , and we became Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; because of this we should get @-@ based , &quot; explained the space list @-@ fifth . &quot;
the British soccer player Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United has moved to a serious injury on the right leg .
&quot; at the Champions League game with the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven , the defen@@ ders was hit by a T@@ ackl@@ ing by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno and changed after a long treatment . &quot;
the first diagnosis was presented at the 20 year old fellow @-@ players from Bas@@ tian sword @-@ far@@ es .
G@@ aul@@ tier feels too old for a enf@@ ant .
it is a mix of very great fashion show and a wax@@ y shop : the designer Jean Paul G@@ aul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich .
&quot; highlights : man@@ ne@@ quin , which thanks to the video proj@@ ections are fri@@ ght@@ ening human . &quot;
&quot; they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who has been involved with Mad@@ onn@@ as St@@ org@@ out@@ fits the great star of the fashion scene - and that he will put men into red@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; I can no longer say that I am the enf@@ ant , the Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; it used to be it easily , meanwhile it is genuine , &quot; said Uwe G@@ aul@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is seen from September 18 to the Kuns@@ thalle that the HY@@ PO @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , is it a luck that the Mo@@ des@@ kt@@ ops has changed his first @-@ sight@@ ed attitude toward a show over his person . &quot;
&quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; for me , an exhibition looks a bit after death &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when you die , you come into the Museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously stayed in the Canadian Montreal and in Paris station .
&quot; it is about so much more than just beautiful dres@@ ses , &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger Die@@ deren . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits provide an insight into the man &apos;s look at an over@@ looked work of the man , the mo@@ de@@ history , without ever had an education . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically is the sch@@ au not built , but it is an excellent chore@@ ograph@@ ing po@@ ckets , for which much effort was run : to recover the doll@@ s , for example , a sty@@ list was engaged . &quot;
14 tons of material have passed the makers according to information of the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
just before the start of the October feast there was a special treat : a le@@ ather@@ ly out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Heidi meets Madonna .
&quot; he always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; women are more mixed than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , said Uwe G@@ aul@@ tier . &quot;
also G@@ aul@@ ti@@ ers old Ted@@ dy is visible in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , not@@ able fashion@@ able hearing of the design . &quot;
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he was attracted to his Ted@@ dy Bear and dres@@ ses .
&quot; to play with a pupp@@ et , his parents would not allowed him . &quot;
and the ab@@ ject of fashion is set to himself later .
he has theft mo@@ de@@ journ@@ als and saw the dra@@ fts of other designers such as G@@ aul@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought this later .
for his first own fashion show he cannot pay the Models .
&quot; they got nothing , they were allowed but the cl@@ ots left . &quot;
jewelry instead of she@@ ine - Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze as Fashion @-@ N@@ ic
it used to be about the long embroider@@ y in and around Pl@@ auen .
&quot; the Emb@@ ro@@ i@@ dered substances and leaders emerged in large quantities for customers , which they worked for example to blan@@ kets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this alone is no longer working , explained Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the Mo@@ ench@@ iness Pl@@ auen . &quot;
instead the fashion is again important .
&quot; in the early times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze , Fashion played a bigger role , was then push@@ es through the home textile industry - and is now being restored as a niche . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt calls a few examples : top in jewelry but accessories such as po@@ ckets and with regional traction .
&quot; at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which stimul@@ ates itself to past support , an increasing customer potential . &quot;
those who are not a niche in the Tex@@ til@@ industry in Germany is no longer a market .
&quot; with us , they already make half of all orders already . &quot;
fashion@@ ness flat Pl@@ auen along with nine other companies member of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and embroider@@ ies .
only they are allowed to carry the protected label .
&quot; over the last 15 years , roughly 80 percent of its sales will be eliminated . &quot;
private trade @-@ stores and also the wholesale trade are almost no longer available .
our products reach the customer in this way .
the mass ware is made much cheaper in the Asian region and almost exclusively via chains .
&quot; in addition , the weak@@ est of the export , up to Russia and the USA . &quot;
plenty of reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association tries to score points by environmental awareness , like Cor@@ dul@@ a Bauer by the Stick@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we introduce a quality seal , which shows that we produce ecological and socially toler@@ ated . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt compl@@ ements : &quot; this also applies to the used materials . &quot;
&quot; he was taught at the snow@@ fall outside of the Western Sax@@ on School of Zwickau , on the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and speci@@ alizes in embroider@@ ies and leaders . &quot;
&quot; to continue competition from the Asian region , one needs to find high quality and innovative products . &quot;
this takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and companies , who must first think economically . &quot;
that is why an existing design may only be varies slightly in order to maintain a customer base .
several years ago Tex@@ til@@ designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter the historical snow@@ tip new .
they also stuff@@ ed the machine in some places small kit@@ chens .
&quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ener Gold@@ smith &apos;s &quot; &quot; Bianca Hall@@ eb@@ ach &quot; &quot; inspired by this : &quot; before I could start with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ tip for her jewelry .
in an elabor@@ ate process it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people of the region identify with the subject of Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; she also delivers to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to clients , whose ancestors have lived in restor@@ ing and surroundings and want a reminder . &quot;
thus I see my jewelry as a modern amb@@ assador to the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze .

&quot; however , according to &quot; entertainment Weekly &quot; however , not a new film , but a kind of continuation , which plays 20 years after the first film with the magical n@@ anny . &quot;
it is about the experience of N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in the times of the World Economic crisis in England .

XI pushed forward to open the economy wide for the world
&quot; the economy must open to the outside world to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group who was commissioned with the ste@@ ering of reform . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; China should apply to promoting foreign investment and know @-@ how and improving strategies for business enterprises , &quot; he said in an appointment at the 16 meeting of the central management group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; start @-@ up and promote reforms to advance new momentum and vitality and offer new place for economic growth , &quot; said Xi . &quot;
&quot; the executive group has adopted a series of policies including a neg@@ ative list to regul@@ ating the market place , relaxation of the border management policy , promotion of the border management policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the citizen @-@ det@@ achment . &quot;
&quot; according to the statement , a negative list is created , the sectors and companies identified for investment not to come into question . &quot;

EU wants to double bl@@ ur@@ ry @-@ border in rob@@ ing
the European Commission wants to double the border values for Mer@@ cury in large rob@@ ing and consumers as a significantly higher dose of ner@@ ve accum@@ ulated .
&quot; the Consumer &apos;s specialities , which is a corresponding working paper of the EU , cri@@ tici@@ zed the plans : &quot; risks and side effects negl@@ ected industrial and environmental policies are passed on with full weight of balance and inf@@ ants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nervous system should be raised for large fish at the end of the food chain such as Hai@@ der or sword @-@ fish reasons &quot; &quot; from one to two milli@@ gram of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ograms of fish . &quot;
&quot; however , big car@@ c@@ lown@@ fish are already so strong , however , due to mer@@ cury that will not be sold at the basis of the remaining bor@@ ough@@ s of roughly 50 percent of the cor@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling of the limit values , then only 14@@ ,5 percent are uns@@ negoti@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in return for this lo@@ osing , the EU wants to con@@ dense the border levels at other fish from at least 0.5 milli@@ gram to 0,1 milli@@ gram of mer@@ cury per kil@@ og@@ ram . &quot;
