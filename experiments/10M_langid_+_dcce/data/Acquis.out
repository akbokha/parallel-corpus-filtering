&quot; apart from Section 4 , Special response loan can be used in general terms of the same withdrawal of responses , which apply for the organisation of the institution in general ; they are refundable at ten years in 50 years . &quot;
special response loan will be granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are refundable in these currencies .
amounts to payment of this switch are directly transferred to the organization that ret@@ ains it .
&quot; each Inter@@ actions loan can be defined by a separate loan agreement between the benefici@@ ary and the car@@ et@@ aker , which is stated in particular the origin of the resources . &quot;
&quot; the revenues from each Inter@@ actions can be used for spending on any issues in the currency of recipients or for goods or services , which are manufactured by the organization , which was established by the managers at the time of the loan granted , recei@@ vers of an individual response . &quot;
&quot; the capital @-@ payments of special actions take place on the special reaction , and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state , pay@@ able amount is returned to its entrance as soon as possible from the stew@@ ard to the concerned Member State . &quot;
the car@@ et@@ aker is taught up to the complete payment of all special response loan from the EEC concerning the inspection of the directors in preparation and by the directors for the directors and programs .
&quot; during the period of the payout of the special response loan , the car@@ et@@ aker will be taught over the development of the special response loan and the expenses for this purpose . &quot;
the publishers will be communic@@ ated by the EEC as soon as possible after completion of the Organisation of the Organisation for a detailed statement of the organization of the organization with an opinion of external invo@@ ices .
after full payout of the special response loan transmitted by the EEC as soon as possible a detailed report on the projects financed by the special features and programs .
&quot; the car@@ et@@ aker is created and performs appropriate record and b@@ illing out of which the contributions to the special editorial , resulting from contro@@ versi@@ al obligations , which are paid to the account and out of the account pay@@ able amounts and payments to the Member States . &quot;
the EEC and the managers work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; for this , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker to the full issue of the means of the special activity example of time to time to have a thought exchange about the state of the Special Tribunal @-@ related programs or projects and on all other questions related to the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; this agreement on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , the EEC and the organization may agree , not into force , the agreement and all of the obligations of the parties with immediate effect are reduced . &quot;

this agreement needs the approval by the individual member states and the EEC in accordance with the legislative provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States have been noti@@ fied the Secretary of the Council of the European Communities and the conclusion of these procedures .
the Secretary General manages this Noti@@ fications together with a Noti@@ fication via the approval of this agreement by the EEC .
&quot; this agreement will be effective and enters into force on the first day of the month , which follows the day of the named Noti@@ fications of the Organisation . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is con@@ stitut@@ ed in two head@@ ings in Danish , German , English , French and Dutch language , with each wor@@ ding is binding . &quot;
&quot; in the considerations , that the agreement is in the form of a letter to change the Annex A of the Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) - has taken the following regulation : &quot;
between the European Atom@@ ic community and Swiss Con@@ federation on the field of controlled nuclear @-@ fusion and Plas@@ map@@ hy@@ si@@ k
&quot; the European Atom@@ ic community , called &quot; Euratom &quot; &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , below , &quot; &quot; Commission &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and DI@@ E Swiss E@@ id@@ gen@@ ossen@@ schaft , called &quot; &quot; Switzerland &quot; , &quot; represented by the Swiss Bundes@@ rat , &quot; standing &quot; Bundes@@ rat &quot; , &quot; &quot;
&quot; this program comprises the creation of a large pilot plant , the project J@@ ET ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation a common company according to Chapter V des Euratom @-@ Treaty - listed &quot; Joint Company J@@ ET &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Switzerland has been engaged in research for several years with research projects in the field of controlled nuclear @-@ fusion and Plas@@ map@@ hy@@ si@@ k and is well acquain@@ ted with the concerned area .
&quot; as far as to the practical use of the controlled nuclear @-@ fusion of the present nuclear power , it is in the interest of the contract parties to avoid un@@ necessary transi@@ tions and have achieved their respective research , which have achieved a higher priority stage due to the energy crisis . &quot;
&quot; this agreement should be able to provide any contractual efforts on the field of controlled nuclear @-@ fusion and the Plas@@ map@@ hy@@ si@@ k for the high potential benefit to avoid un@@ necessary validation and accordingly to achieve the common goal of this research , d.@@ h . the cost @-@ oriented electri@@ fication re@@ reaction by using the controlled core control reaction , faster to achieve . &quot;
&quot; to achieve the target of the present agreement , the parties affili@@ ated their respective in Annex I and II this agreement defined research programmes , &quot; &quot; Euratom programme &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Swiss program &quot; . &quot; &quot;
