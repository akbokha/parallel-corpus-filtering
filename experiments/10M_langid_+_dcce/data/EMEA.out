&quot; this document is a summary of the European Public Prosec@@ ut@@ ational Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Human@@ it@@ ration ( CH@@ MP ) has been judged to reach recommendations regarding the application of the drug . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package version ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharm@@ ac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you desire further information on the basis of recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg melt let@@ ten ( tablets that count itself in the mouth ) , as a solution to one ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. wir@@ res thinking and speaking , Hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or vision of things that are not present ) , distr@@ ust and mad@@ ness ; • Bi@@ polar disorder , a psych@@ ological disease , in which the patients have a mental ep@@ isodes ( periods ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood . &quot;
A@@ bili@@ fy is used to treat the moderate ep@@ ic ep@@ isodes and prevention of man@@ ic ep@@ isodes in patients who are addressed in the past in the past .
injection solution is used for quick control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders when the or@@ al intake of the drug is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution can take care of one or the mel@@ ting items in patients , which is prepared from tablets difficulties . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time , which are exactly the same as A@@ bili@@ fy , the dosage should be modified by A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances which enable communication between ner@@ ve cells with each other . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ go@@ benzene probably acts mainly as a &quot; parti@@ te Ag@@ on@@ ist &quot; for the rec@@ ept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters Dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also Ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ go@@ eth@@ ics like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and d@@ op@@ amine , but in lower dimensions than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter works to activate the rec@@ ept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; as d@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine in schi@@ z@@ ophr@@ enia , and bi@@ polar disorder is a role to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , causing psych@@ ot@@ eric or man@@ ic symptoms decre@@ ased and its re@@ vocation will be prevented . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of ag@@ bili@@ fy to prevent the res@@ ence of symptoms , was investig@@ ated in three studies over up to one year . &quot;
the effectiveness of inj@@ ector solution was compared in two studies on 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophr@@ enia or similar diseases that compared to a plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in a further study , A@@ bili@@ fy about twelve weeks to 347 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l , in another study the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo to prevent the res@@ ence to 160 patients where the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study on 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that suffered from Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( a different anti psych@@ ot@@ ik@@ um ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
&quot; in all studies , the change of symptoms experienced by the patients using a standard sk@@ ala for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who investig@@ ates the treatment . &quot;
&quot; the company also carried out studies through to examine how the body takes the mel@@ ting , and the solution to take . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies with the injection solution I showed patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in cans of 5,@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg received a significant reduction in symptoms than the patients who received a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder decre@@ ased ag@@ bili@@ fy in four of five short @-@ term studies more effective than plac@@ ebo .
A@@ bili@@ fy that also prevented up to 74 weeks in more effective than plac@@ ebo the re @-@ employed ep@@ isodes in previously treat@@ able patients and if it was in addition to an existing treatment .
ag@@ bili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg dos@@ es decre@@ asing more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms conf@@ used un@@ rest and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , extr@@ ap@@ yr@@ am@@ id@@ ale disorders ( un@@ controll@@ able ) , les@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( trem@@ bling ) , les@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( decre@@ asing ) , fatigue and ex@@ haus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , rest@@ less ( sleeping disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ nei@@ ra ( CH@@ MP ) managed to conclude that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy ep@@ isodes at Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , as well as in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients , the mainly man@@ ic ep@@ isodes , and in which the man@@ ic ep@@ isodes had over the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ benzene in terms of the risks . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the committee also came to the outcome that the advantages of inj@@ ecting un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophr@@ enia or in patients with schi@@ z@@ ep@@ isodes at Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if a or@@ al therapy is not suitable to over@@ head the risks . &quot;
June 2004 the European Commission named Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceu@@ tical Europe Ltd . a permit for the establishment of A@@ bili@@ fy in the entire European Union .
AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y is for the treatment of moderate until heavy man@@ ic ep@@ isodes of the Bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients that were mainly man@@ ic ep@@ isodes and their man@@ ic ep@@ isodes for the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ benzene ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose for AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a lasting dose of 15 mg / day once daily independently of meals .
an increased effectiveness in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended dose for AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combined therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y in treating schi@@ z@@ ophr@@ enia and Bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
with regard to the bigger sensitivity of this patient group should be considered a lower initi@@ ate dose into consideration when clinical factors are right ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ duc@@ tor is derived from combined therapy should be reduced the Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ al dosage to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the appearance of su@@ izi@@ al behavior belongs to psych@@ ot@@ eric diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the start or after a change of anti psych@@ ological therapy ( see section 4.8 ) .
the results of an epid@@ emi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder has no elev@@ ated Su@@ izi@@ a @-@ risk of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ benzene in comparison to other Anti@@ psych@@ ologists .
Ari@@ pi@@ benzene should be applied with caution in patients with known cardi@@ ovascular diseases ( deh@@ ydr@@ ation diseases ) , cerem@@ onial disorders that treatment with blood pressure ( deh@@ ydr@@ ation , treatment with blood pressure drugs ) or hyper@@ tone ( including ak@@ zel@@ e and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) . &quot;

if with a AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y treated patients signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ sp@@ ines should appear to reduce the dose or to break the treatment .
&quot; when a patient sign and symptoms developed to indicate to a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear high f@@ ever without an additional clinical manifest@@ ation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ otic infections , including AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y . &quot;
&quot; therefore Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ benzene in patients with cl@@ amp@@ ry waste in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese or in states that are being used with cl@@ amp@@ ry cases in connection with caution . &quot;

&quot; however , there were in one of these studies , a study with Fix@@ er dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the demand for un@@ wanted zer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events with Ari@@ pi@@ go@@ eth@@ atic patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emic , in some cases extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ azi@@ aus or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar com@@ a or death , was reported in patients who have been treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ ic substances , including AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y . &quot;
there is no exact risk assessment for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emic @-@ related un@@ wanted events with AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents of patients to allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; Poly@@ di@@ p@@ her , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ h@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes Mell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes Mell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of deteri@@ oration of glu@@ co@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; a weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophr@@ enia , and in patients with biological agriculture , the use of anti psych@@ ologists , in which weight gain is seen or an un@@ healthy lifestyle , and could lead to serious comp@@ lications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary impact of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ benzene in the Central @-@ ven@@ se system , caution is recommended if Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ benzene in combination with alcohol or other central effective medic@@ inal products is taken with the over@@ lay side effects such as Se@@ aling ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 @-@ ant@@ agon@@ ist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ in , a Mag@@ ens@@ acid Blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ benzene , whereby this effect is not relevant to be clin@@ ically relevant . &quot;

&quot; it is to be expected that other high @-@ effective inf@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors from CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , like flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects have and therefore should be made similar dosage . &quot;

&quot; when you consider the common gifts of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other high @-@ effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors with AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y , the potential benefits should over@@ weig@@ h the potential risks to the patient . &quot;

&quot; the effectiveness of Abra@@ x@@ ane was investig@@ ated in a capit@@ als , at the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters used earlier an anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abroad ( in all Gab@@ e or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs by means ( given in combination with other medicines for reducing the side effects ) .
&quot; in total , in the capit@@ u@@ die 72 ( 31 % ) of 229 with Abroad patients treated on treatment , opposite 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients received , conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el included medicines . &quot;
&quot; if only the patients were treated because of metastatic breast cancer , there were no difference between drugs and survival as far as to deteri@@ oration of the disease and survival . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , with patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , in terms of these indicators , that it was more effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el included medicine . &quot;
&quot; it may not be applied with patient , breast@@ feeding , or before the beginning of the treatment low neutr@@ ality numbers in the blood . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Human@@ ity is fixed , that the first treatment was no longer propos@@ es , more effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el &apos;s medicines and that it has to be used in contrast to other P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicines . &quot;

the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic Mam@@ mak@@ ar@@ cin@@ oma is treated by data from 106 patients in two independent di@@ still@@ ed studies and of 454 patients who were treated in a random@@ ized phase III compar@@ ative study .
&quot; in a study were treated 43 patients with metastatic Mam@@ mak@@ ar@@ cin@@ oma , which was treated in the form of an in@@ fusion between 30 minutes by a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 is used as in@@ fusion between 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic Mam@@ mak@@ ar@@ cin@@ oma . &quot;
this multi @-@ cent@@ ric study was carried out in patients with metastatic Mam@@ mak@@ ar@@ cin@@ oma which received every 3 weeks a mon@@ otherapy with P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medi@@ ation of an allergi@@ c reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medi@@ ation ( N = 229 ) .

&quot; in patients with chronic kid@@ ney disease , or patients who receive a chem@@ otherapy should always be recommended in recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ lining ) in adults or between 9,@@ 5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot;
&quot; the power values of all patients are to control before treatment , to ensure that no iron ore lies , and iron supplements should be administ@@ rated throughout the treatment . &quot;

Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin will also be used before operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell to which a gene ( DNA ) brought them to the formation of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was regarded as an injection in an V@@ ene in the framework of a capit@@ als with 479 patients who caused by kid@@ ney problems caused by kid@@ ney problems caused by the reference problems .
all patients participating in this study was at least eight weeks in E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a v@@ ene before they were either by se@@ amed or continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
main indic@@ ator for the effectiveness was the change of the her@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ ary values between the beginning of the study and the trial period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
&quot; in addition , the company laid out the results of a study in which the effects of under the skin is inj@@ ected ab@@ se@@ amed with the those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o on 114 cancer patients were received . &quot;
&quot; in the study with patients who caused by kid@@ ney @-@ problems caused by kid@@ ney @-@ problems , the her@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ ation of patients were forced on ab@@ se@@ amed , in the same measure , as for those patients who have received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to the patients who continue to be E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , an increase of 0,0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12,@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which occasionally lead to symptoms of an En@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as su@@ dden , st@@ ending mig@@ rations and conf@@ ec@@ ity can lead . &quot;
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients that may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergi@@ c ) against ep@@ ox@@ et@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other components .
&quot; Ab@@ ar@@ amed as inj@@ ecting under the skin is not recommended for treating kid@@ ney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that this is caused by no allergi@@ c reactions . &quot;
the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ nei@@ x ( CH@@ MP ) wrote that for ab@@ se@@ amed according to the provisions of the European Union of evidence that the medicine was a comparable quality , security and efficiency profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;

&quot; summary of the EP@@ AR for the public , the present document is a summary of the European Public Prosec@@ ution ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ nei@@ x ( CH@@ MP ) has been assessed for recommendations regarding the application of the drug . &quot;
Ac@@ tos is used for the treatment of type 2 @-@ diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insul@@ in @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can not be displayed alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially over@@ weight patient ) in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) . • It can be applied together with another Diab@@ et@@ es@@ medi@@ ation ( Dual therapy ) .
&quot; it can also be applied in addition to met@@ form@@ in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) , which can not be satisfac@@ tory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest identi@@ fiable dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insul@@ in can be ret@@ ained the previous dose of Sul@@ fon@@ yl resin , except for patients with Hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emic ( lower blood sugar ) ; here should be reduced the dose of Sul@@ fon@@ yl resin and the insul@@ in . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body is better to be upgra@@ ded in better , and the blood sugar levels can be better set to adjust type @-@ 2 diabetes . &quot;
&quot; for more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ o therapy was analy@@ sed ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ osis , in addition they received up to 3.5 years either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood has been measured in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ ity , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) , which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a lower@@ ing of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which makes the blood pressure in applying the dos@@ es of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg were reduced . &quot;
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ o study the effect of additional gifts of Ac@@ tos to existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ent in lower@@ ing the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values around 0.@@ 94 % whereas the additional gifts of plac@@ ebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
&quot; in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insul@@ in at 289 patients was examined in addition the patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to insul@@ in , a reduction in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0,@@ 69 % after 6 months compared to patients who participated in addition to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side @-@ side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual dys@@ functions , infections of the upper respir@@ atory ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hy@@ m@@ esth@@ esia ( decre@@ ased sensitivity to maturity ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos may neither be used in patients who possibly re@@ conc@@ e@@ ably ( allergi@@ c ) compared to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , Her@@ cul@@ in@@ fertility , or di@@ abe@@ tic K@@ eto@@ acid - S@@ ur@@ es@@ pi@@ egel - in the blood ) . &quot;
it was decided that Ac@@ tos in the scope of a mon@@ otherapy ( in the sole use ) as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in patients should not appear in which met@@ form@@ es is not displayed .
October 2000 the European Commission commissioned the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited is a permit for the use of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
&quot; tablets are white to white , round , v@@ aul@@ ted and wear on one side the mark@@ ings &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the wor@@ ding &quot; AC@@ TOS . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is also shown for the combination with insul@@ in in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar can be adjusted with insul@@ in in@@ sufficient and for those met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance is un@@ suitable ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on for patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients , which are endanger@@ ed by the presence at least one risk factor ( e.g. early heart disease or sy@@ mptom@@ atic cardi@@ ovascular disease ) , the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a in@@ fertility , weight gain or o@@ hum@@ ble , particularly those with reduced cardi@@ tis reserve . &quot;
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of an in@@ fertility power that will be observed if pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is applied in combination with insul@@ in .
a kar@@ di@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ars Out@@ come study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on for patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ existing advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cul@@ ine disorder .
&quot; in this study , an increase in reports of in@@ fertility levels , which however did not lead to an increase in mort@@ ality in the study . &quot;
in patients with increased output liver disease ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standardi@@ zation ) or with other signs of a liver disease may not be used .
&quot; if the AL@@ T mirr@@ ors up to the 3 @-@ fold of the upper limit of the stand@@ ar@@ dised range , the liver disease is as soon as possible again . &quot;
&quot; if a patient symptoms develops according to a hep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ resolved exercise , fatigue , appeti@@ te , and / or dar@@ ker Har@@ n , are the liver disease . &quot;
the decision whether the treatment of patients with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on will continue to be continued until the pre@@ domin@@ ate of the laboratory parameters of the clinical evaluation .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one has been proven a dos@@ ing @-@ dependent weight concent@@ rations that can be st@@ aged by o@@ besity and in some cases associated with a hydr@@ ation .
&quot; as a result of a hem@@ ol@@ ocation , among the therapy with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on a lower reduction in the middle heads ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and of the Hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction of 4,@@ 1 % ) . &quot;
similar changes have been observed at compar@@ ative controlled studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of the hem@@ og@@ r@@ its around 3.@@ 6 @-@ 4.@@ 1 % ) and to a lower extent also in patients under Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff and In@@ sul@@ in ( relative reduction of the her@@ mo@@ eller around 1 @-@ 2 % and of the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its around 1 @-@ 3.@@ 2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insul@@ in sensitive to patients , the Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one as or@@ al branch or triple therapy with a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ osis or as secondary therapy with insul@@ in @-@ dependent hy@@ gly@@ ca@@ emic . &quot;
&quot; following the market launch was reported among the treatment with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ans , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , over a occurr@@ ence or deteri@@ oration of a di@@ abe@@ tic Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ d@@ ems with a reduction of visual acu@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and the occurr@@ ence of Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ dem@@ en , but for@@ ce@@ ful doctors should be aware of the possibility of the visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ic waste should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summar@@ izing analysis of announcements un@@ wanted events regarding bone breaks , controlled , dou@@ bling clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients who have been treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on . &quot;
&quot; the mere Fra@@ ktur in@@ inci@@ dence was 1,@@ 9 fr@@ ac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years at the with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated with teenage boys and 1.1 fr@@ ac@@ tures for women who have been treated with a compar@@ ative medi@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in Pro@@ active study , a study about 3.5 years on the examination of cardi@@ ovascular events , fr@@ ac@@ tures in 44 / 870 ( 5.3 % ) with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated patients , compared with 23 / 905 ( 2.5 % ; 0,5 fr@@ ac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years ) in patients who have been treated with a compar@@ ative medi@@ ation . &quot;
patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy and if a patient wishes to be pregnant or if a patient wishes to impos@@ e this treatment ( see Section 4.6 ) .
studies on the examination of the inter@@ actions showed that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on does not have any relevant effects on the phar@@ ma@@ co@@ ine@@ tic or Pharma@@ cology of Dig@@ ox@@ in , War@@ mar@@ in , phen@@ o@@ co@@ um@@ on and Met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
inter@@ actions with pharmaceu@@ ticals that are met@@ aboli@@ zed by these enzy@@ mes , e.g. or@@ al contra@@ indications , cy@@ clo@@ spor@@ in , Calci@@ um can@@ lo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duction tas@@ eh@@ em@@ mer are not expected . &quot;
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ ck ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) results in an increase in AU@@ C from Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on to the 3 @-@ fold .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 II C8 @-@ In@@ duc@@ tor ) results in a reduction of AU@@ C by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on to 54 % .
this is attri@@ but@@ able that under treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on which decre@@ ases in pregnant hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insul@@ in resistance of the wom@@ ens and thereby reduced the availability of met@@ abo@@ lic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fet@@ al growth .
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , individual accidents : unknown ( of present data not estimated ) . &quot;
these lead to a temporary change in the Tur@@ g@@ ors and the b@@ illing index@@ es of the lens as they are also observed in other hy@@ po@@ gly@@ c@@ emic agents .
&quot; in clinical studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T junction , the upper limit of the stand@@ ar@@ rest of the stand@@ ar@@ rest is often the same as among plac@@ ebo , however rare as in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ osis . &quot;
in a Out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cul@@ ine disease was the frequency of serious her@@ nia efficiency at Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 1.6 % higher than at plac@@ ebo if pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on respectively .
&quot; since the market launch it has been reported more about Her@@ cul@@ ine efficiency under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , however , more frequently if pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was used in combination with insul@@ in or in patients with in@@ fertility efficiency in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; a summar@@ izing analysis of announcements un@@ wanted events with regard to bone breaks out of random@@ ized , controlled , dou@@ bling clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients in the patients with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated groups and over 7.@@ 400 patients treated with compar@@ isons groups . &quot;
&quot; in the over a period of 3.5 years of ongoing Pro@@ active study , fr@@ ac@@ tures in 44 / 870 ( 5.@@ 1 % ) who treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated with 23 / 905 ( 2.5 % ) with patients with a compar@@ ative medi@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; when taking the high @-@ dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day above seven days did not appear symptoms . &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on seems to work with a activation of specific core rec@@ ept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ator . Rec@@ ept@@ or @-@ g ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) ) results in the animal @-@ model to an increased In@@ sul@@ in@@ sensi@@ tiveness of Leb@@ anese cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduces glu@@ co@@ se@@ production in the liver and increases the peri@@ pher@@ al glu@@ co@@ upon in case of an insul@@ in resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ver@@ sus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d than mon@@ otherapy has been pursued over two years to investigate the time until dec@@ ay of the therapeutic effects ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 treatment of treatment ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after the start of therapy , a blood decre@@ ased roll ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one at 69 % of patients treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ eb@@ ok@@ ont@@ rol@@ ed study on 12 months , patients , whose blood sugar were adjusted despite three month @-@ phase phase with insul@@ in ina@@ de@@ quate , to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under the Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced the average H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - value around 0,@@ 45 % , compared to the patients who continues just In@@ sul@@ in received ; a reduction of in@@ sul@@ ph@@ osi@@ ties in which with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was observed . &quot;
in clinical trials over one year showed themselves to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on a statis@@ tically significant withdrawal of the Alb@@ um@@ in / Cre@@ atin@@ in @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ ers in comparison to the output values .
the effect of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg ver@@ sus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small , on 18 weeks out of study on type @-@ 2 di@@ abe@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical studies have been observed in comparison to plac@@ ebo a reduction in the total plas@@ ma @-@ tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the free fat acids , as well as the increase in the HD@@ L@@ - Ch@@ olester@@ insp@@ els as well as neg@@ li@@ ous , however clin@@ ically not significantly significant increase LD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels . &quot;
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years reduced Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on compared to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d the total plas@@ ma @-@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol levels . &quot;
&quot; compared to plac@@ ebo was not statis@@ tically significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol levels , while under met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d decre@@ ased values were observed . &quot;
&quot; in a study over 20 weeks reduced Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , not only the so@@ ber @-@ Tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial elev@@ ated Tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de @-@ absor@@ ption as well as on the hep@@ atic Tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a kar@@ di@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ars Out@@ come study , 5@@ 238 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ existing advanced mak@@ rov@@ ascular disease in groups are random@@ ised , which received over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ di@@ abe@@ tic and cardi@@ ovascular therapy either Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; according to or@@ ous application , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is quickly res@@ or@@ ated , whereby the peak concent@@ rations is reached on un@@ changing Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in plas@@ ma usually 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; based on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV for effectiveness in about the triple of the effectiveness of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative eff@@ ic@@ acy of M @-@ II was minimal . &quot;
&quot; in Inter@@ governmental studies could be proven that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on does not have any relevant effect on the phar@@ ma@@ co@@ ine@@ tic or Pharma@@ cology of Dig@@ ox@@ in , War@@ mar@@ in , phen@@ o@@ co@@ um@@ on and Met@@ form@@ in . &quot;

&quot; according to or@@ ational use of radio@@ active mark@@ ered pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans the mark@@ er was mainly found in the f@@ eces ( 55 % ) , and to a lower scale in the Har@@ n ( 45 % ) . &quot;
the medium plas@@ ma @-@ elimination period of un@@ changing Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is for people 5 @-@ 6 hours and that of the entire active met@@ abo@@ lic resi@@ dences is at 16 - 23 hours .
the Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ concent@@ rations of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and its met@@ abo@@ lic are lower than in patients with reduced kid@@ ney function lower than in healthy Pro@@ ban@@ den , with the r@@ ats of the or@@ mal Clear@@ ance of the mother sub@@ section but res@@ em@@ bles . &quot;

this is attri@@ but@@ able that under treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on which is decre@@ ased in the creation of hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insul@@ in resistance of the wom@@ ens and thereby reduced the availability of met@@ abo@@ lic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fet@@ al growth .

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is used for treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease , where the bone breaks can be used in women after men@@ op@@ ause , where a risk for a low vitamin D mirror . &quot;
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drink or immig@@ rants ( including ant@@ acid , calcium and vit@@ al@@ pen@@ alties ) . &quot;
&quot; to avoid a maturity of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient must take place until after the first food intake of the day , which shall take place at the ear@@ liest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D@@ 3 are already separated from each other in drugs that are approved in the European Union , the company placed data from earlier studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also carried out a study with 35 men and 682 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis by to medi@@ ate the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE with regard to increasing the vitamin D reflection .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment the proportion of patients with reduced vitamin D mirror was treated with AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE , which were treated with AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE ( 11 % ) than for those who took exclusively Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also put data before , which is shown in AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE included Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at @-@ dose exactly the dose that is needed for preventing a bone lu@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed with 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of movement appar@@ ats , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ ilep@@ sy ( diges@@ tion ) , sti@@ ul@@ ence ( diges@@ tion ) , sti@@ ul@@ ence ( diges@@ tion ) , dy@@ sp@@ h@@ ag@@ ie ( dis@@ rup@@ tions ) , dy@@ sp@@ h@@ ag@@ ie ( g@@ ow@@ l ) , sp@@ las@@ h@@ ag@@ ia ( g@@ aps ) , flash@@ es ab@@ dom@@ en ( g@@ low@@ ed belly ) , as well as sau@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( all@@ ergy ) against Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other components of AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE cannot be applied . &quot;

&quot; the doctor is therefore attentive to all signs and symptoms , which should be pointed to possible mal@@ oph@@ age@@ al ir@@ rit@@ ation like dy@@ sp@@ h@@ ag@@ ie , pain while swallow@@ ing or retro@@ sp@@ inal pain , or a new or sc@@ lim@@ mer@@ ing of heart@@ burn the medicine ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of severe mal@@ oph@@ age@@ al side effects seem to be raised in patients who do not take any correct , and / or after the occurr@@ ence of symptoms resulting in a mal@@ oph@@ age@@ al ir@@ rit@@ ation . &quot;
it is very important that all dos@@ ing instructions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .

other diseases that imp@@ aired the mineral change ( such as vitamin D @-@ lack and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ denti@@ ality ) should be treated before the beginning of the therapy with AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE .
&quot; Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium @-@ supplements , ant@@ azi@@ da and some or@@ al medicines can affect the Res@@ or@@ ption of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , when they are taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients must wait after taking Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at least 30 minutes before they take other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific Inter@@ governmental studies have not been carried out , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken jointly with a variety of usually prescribed medicines without having clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is intended solely for application in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not responsible for pregnant women &apos;s pregnancy .

&quot; as a result of an conversion to an alternative form@@ ulation , a therapeutic medicines must be done and appropriate dosage adjustment to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m remains . &quot;
the dosage of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f should be primarily based on the clinical evaluation of abor@@ ation and compatibility in single case and to blood @-@ reflection ( see below ) recommendations

further dos@@ ing adjustments may be necessary later because the phar@@ ma@@ co@@ ine@@ tic of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m can change in the course of stabil@@ isation of the patient after tran@@ splan@@ tation .

&quot; tran@@ splan@@ t on adult patients , which are placed on Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , is a or@@ ale initiation dose of 0,15 mg / kg / day daily once in the morning . &quot;

dosage adjustment based in specific patient groups with reduced Leb@@ er@@ function Z@@ ur maintenance of blood levels in the targeted area can be required in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions a flo@@ ating of the dosage .
patients with reduced kid@@ ney function because the kid@@ ney function has no influence on the phar@@ ma@@ co@@ ine@@ tic of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be taken out of it that a dosage adjustment is not required .
&quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ical potential of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m , however , a me@@ tic@@ ulous monitoring of kid@@ ney function ( including a regular determination of Ser@@ um@@ kre@@ atin@@ insp@@ ections , a calculation of the cre@@ ati@@ inc@@ ance and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary system ) recommended . &quot;

recommendations on the valley mirror in the full blo@@ t The dosage should be primarily based on the clinical evaluation of def@@ ect@@ ation and compatibility of the inf@@ estation of full @-@ level Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ li@@ li@@ m @-@ Tal@@ mirror @-@ controls .
&quot; it is recommended for frequent controls of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m @-@ Tal@@ mirror during the first two weeks after tran@@ splan@@ tation , followed by perio@@ dic checks during training therapy . &quot;
blood @-@ Tal@@ mirror of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m should also change after conversion of pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , dos@@ is@@ sing changes to immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in simultaneous use of substances that could be controlled by Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is a medicine with a low Clear@@ ance , adjustments of the dose may need several days until the ste@@ ady State entered . &quot;
the data in clinical trials can make sure that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the Tal@@ mirror in the blood 20 ng / ml do not exceed .
in clinical practice the valley mirror of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m in the full blo@@ t in the first time after liver tran@@ splan@@ ts normally in the area of 5 - 20 ng / ml and with - and heart@@ tran@@ splan@@ ts patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the expl@@ oration therapy of Leb@@ er- , N@@ ier@@ en- und Cardi@@ tran@@ splan@@ tation were generally used blood @-@ concent@@ rations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious un@@ wanted events , including tran@@ splan@@ tation or other side effects , which can occur in consequence of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m under@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m form@@ ulation and the corresponding daily dos@@ ing ; transform@@ ations of the form@@ ulation or the regime should only be carried out under the narrow control of an in tran@@ splan@@ tation ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; 5 For treatment adult patients with tran@@ splan@@ ts proved to be proven towards other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ ants , there are no clinical data for ret@@ ardi@@ zed form@@ ulation Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; to the proph@@ yla@@ xis of tran@@ splan@@ t tran@@ splan@@ tation and tran@@ splan@@ ts in child abuse are still not clinical data to ret@@ ardi@@ zed form@@ ulation Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; because of possible inter@@ actions that can lead to a flo@@ ating of tac@@ tical levels in the blood and a Atten@@ u@@ ation of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , or other plant bre@@ eds during treatment with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with Di@@ ar@@ rh@@ ö is a particularly careful monitoring of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - concent@@ rations in the blood , since the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m blood mirror under such circumstances can be subject to considerable moment@@ um . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , among Pro@@ gra@@ f was considered to observe a car@@ di@@ omy@@ opathy in Kam@@ mer@@ - or se@@ pt@@ um hyper@@ tro@@ phy , which can therefore also be observed under Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders , are already existing heart suffering , a treatment with cor@@ tik@@ ost@@ o@@ ids , hyper@@ tension , n@@ udi@@ - or liver dys@@ functions , infections , liqui@@ dity and oil . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va , the effect of sun@@ light or UV light should be restricted by appropriate clothing or use of a solar code using a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms for P@@ RES like head@@ aches , modified state of consciousness , cl@@ amping and vision@@ ing , should be a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. : &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f Hart@@ l , ret@@ ardi@@ ans , L@@ act@@ ose is included in patients with the rare Gal@@ act@@ osis @-@ intoler@@ ance , le@@ act@@ ase @-@ lack or glu@@ co@@ se @-@ Gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ absor@@ ption special caution . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of drugs or herbal remedies , which are known as Hem@@ mer or in@@ duction of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can influence metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m and thus reduce the blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m . &quot;
it is therefore advis@@ able to change the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - blood mirror with simultaneous gifts of substances that can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and to adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m dosage to maintain simultaneous preser@@ v@@ ations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strong prono@@ unced inter@@ effect was performed with an@@ tim@@ y@@ k@@ cot@@ ics like K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ol , I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and Vor@@ ov@@ az@@ ol and with the Macro@@ lid antibiot@@ ic and HIV @-@ Prot@@ eas@@ eh@@ em@@ ania ( z . &quot;
&quot; phar@@ ma@@ co@@ ine@@ tical studies , that the rise of blood mirror mainly consists of the increased or@@ phan@@ age of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , caused by the in@@ hibition of gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal fluid , resulting . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ performance pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as it is used in ac@@ utes degra@@ dation , can increase concentration by Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m in the blood . &quot;
effect of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ Hem@@ mer ; therefore the simultaneous application of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be met@@ aboli@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 met@@ aboli@@ zed met@@ abo@@ lic metabolism .
da Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contra@@ dic@@ tive and therefore can increase hormon@@ al position is particularly careful in decisions about recep@@ tion@@ ate measures .
the results of animal have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus pot@@ entially reduce the Clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ on and extend their semi @-@ pro@@ long@@ ation .
&quot; the results of a small number of investigations on tran@@ splan@@ t patients provide no indication that under Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va , increased risk for un@@ wanted events with regard to the course and the result of pregnancy . &quot;

adv@@ ate is used for treatment and prevention of ble@@ eding in patients with h@@ amm@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( a due to the lack of factor VIII @-@ related blood circulation ) .
dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether Adv@@ ate to treat ble@@ eding or to prevent ble@@ eding in surgical procedures .
patients with hal@@ op@@ hili@@ a A suffer from a factor VIII short@@ age of what blood @-@ minded problems such as blood vessels in joints , muscles or inner organs . &quot;
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extr@@ acted from human plas@@ ma but after a method that is called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot;
it is produced by a cell to which a gene ( DNA ) brought them to the formation of the human scent factor VIII .
&quot; advoc@@ ate is another combined in the European Union called Re@@ ins@@ ate , similarly , however , is different , so that the drug does not contain proteins or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate har@@ rig@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of pharmaceu@@ ticals was examined as well as in surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the capit@@ als , the effectiveness of advoc@@ ate was rated in the prevention of blood vessels in 86 % of 510 new blood @-@ sep@@ iso@@ ds with &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; respectively with &quot; &quot; good &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of advoc@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are sw@@ elling , head@@ aches , py@@ rex@@ ie ( f@@ ever ) and the formation of anti@@ bodies against factor VIII . &quot;
adv@@ ate must not be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergi@@ c ) against the human bar@@ inner factor VIII , mouse or ham@@ ster@@ ling or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission sent to the company B@@ ax@@ ter AG made a permit for the intervention of Adv@@ ate in the entire European Union . &quot;
dosage The dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy depends on the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII @-@ def@@ ect according to the place and the extent of blood circulation and the clinical state of the patient .
&quot; in the following spher@@ ical events , the factor VIII activity should not be found under the specified plastic level ( in % of the standard or in i.e. / dl ) . &quot;

injection all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat the danger to the patient .
during the treatment process the control of the inj@@ ections and the frequency of inj@@ ections will be an appropriate determination of the factor VIII @-@ Plas@@ mas@@ egel .

&quot; in patients with high In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or@@ values , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures will need to be wo@@ und@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the agreement length is to be addressed after the patient , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exc@@ eeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alised anti@@ bodies against factor VIII is a known comp@@ lication in the treatment of patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .

&quot; based on the data collected since the first @-@ time data has been evaluated the CH@@ MP the benefits risk , but considering that the security profile will be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore the CH@@ MP on the basis of the security panel of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a fil@@ ing of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , decided that the fil@@ ming has to apply for further extensions in 5 years . &quot;
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ec@@ ular Limited has officially launched the Committee for Human@@ ity ( CH@@ MP ) that the company will take its application for authorisation for the intervention of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
&quot; however , the chest , the brain , the brain , the b@@ ones , or the past@@ ure ( tissues , which connects other structures in the body , and is based on them ) . &quot;
&quot; this is a kind of virus that has changed , gene@@ tically modified that it can wear an gene into the cells of the body . &quot;
&quot; with the virus in Adv@@ exin , it is an &quot; &quot; A@@ den@@ o@@ virus &quot; , &quot; that it has been changed that there is no copies of themselves and therefore cannot trigger infection with people . &quot;
Adv@@ exin could have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed by the non @-@ def@@ ective in the human body existing p@@ 53 gene , is usually borne to restore cor@@ rupt DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be restored . &quot;
&quot; at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer , when the p@@ 53 @-@ gene is broken , the p@@ 53 @-@ protein is not working correctly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company placed data from a study with a patient prior to the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i Cancer in the area of sub@@ construction , in the b@@ ones and the brain . &quot;
&quot; after CH@@ MP , the answers of the company had been checked for the questions asked questions were still un@@ solved . &quot;
&quot; based on the examination of the final documents created by CH@@ MP to day 120 a list of questions that will be sent to the company . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP , not suffici@@ ently proved that the inj@@ ections of Adv@@ exin at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ tum@@ ors will bring advantages to patients . &quot;
&quot; the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of pharmaceu@@ ticals in the body , the type of administration and the safety of drugs . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not suffici@@ ently proven that Adv@@ ance can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
&quot; the company made the CH@@ MP not aware of whether the withdrawal of consequences for patients has to participate in clinical studies or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ exin . &quot;
changing substance release means that the tablets are so coll@@ ectively that one of the effective elements immediately and the other slowly will be released over a few hours .
Aer@@ ina@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seas@@ onal allergi@@ c Rhin@@ itis ( hy@@ po@@ is@@ ks caused by a all@@ ergy to pol@@ len against pol@@ len against pol@@ len ( mu@@ til@@ ting nose ) in patients with nas@@ al skin sw@@ elling ( m@@ op@@ ter nose ) .
&quot; for adults and young adults from 12 years the recommended dose of aer@@ ina@@ ze twice daily a tablet , which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ended as soon as the symptoms , especially the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al skin ( hide N@@ ose ) . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of drugs can be found on the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
&quot; the main @-@ effective dimensions were the changes of the sever@@ ity of the hy@@ po@@ graphy of sy@@ mpt@@ om , which reports from the patient before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment . &quot;
&quot; during the study the patients received their symptoms all 12 hours into a di@@ ary , and raised with a standard sk@@ ala , as hard as the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; considering all the hy@@ po@@ ds of sy@@ mpt@@ om out except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported the patients , the aer@@ ina@@ ze as@@ sump@@ tions caused by the acceptance of symptoms around 46,@@ 0 % , compared to 35,@@ 9 % in patients , the Pseud@@ o@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al skin was regarded , the patients shown among Aer@@ ina@@ ze showed a lin@@ ation of symptoms around 37,@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % for the patients who took di@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aer@@ ina@@ ze ( observed with 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are T@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ die ( cordi@@ on@@ eness ) , on@@ sense , head@@ ache , fatigue , fatigue , har@@ ness , fatigue , In@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ) , som@@ nia and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ ina@@ ze may not be un@@ sensitive ( allergi@@ c ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , p@@ seud@@ o@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or one of the other components , against ad@@ ren@@ er@@ ge agents or Lor@@ at@@ adin ( another medicine for the treatment of allergi@@ es ) . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ ina@@ ze should also not be used in patients , which are suffering from a bott@@ led water pressure ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ san@@ itation ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ san@@ itation ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ san@@ itation ( hyper@@ tension ) , or have already caused a risk for the mur@@ dered stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission commissioned the company SP Europe to make approval for the distributors of Aer@@ ina@@ ze throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , is in whole to swal@@ low ( d. h. without it to break down or too rough ) . &quot;
Aer@@ ina@@ ze should not be used due to the mal@@ eness of data for in@@ comprehen@@ sibility and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) not to children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is to keep as short as possible and should not be continued after finishing the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application time on 10 days since long @-@ time application can decrease the activity of p@@ seud@@ o@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with the time .
after decrease in the sw@@ elling of the mu@@ co@@ us membran@@ es in the upper breath for the treatment of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin can be continued as mon@@ otherapy .
&quot; as Aer@@ o@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine contains , the medicine is also contra@@ dic@@ ated in patients who are treated with a mon@@ o@@ amin@@ oxid@@ ase ( Ma@@ o ) -@@ Hem@@ mer or within 2 weeks after the end of such a therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ e@@ tic activity at combined application of p@@ seud@@ o@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine animals with other vas@@ o@@ und@@ et@@ ine , Per@@ go@@ id , Lis@@ ur@@ id , acry@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , Eph@@ ed@@ rine , Oxy@@ met@@ az@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) . &quot;
the safety and effectiveness of these combined therapy has not been tested for this patient and the data are not enough to address corresponding recommendations for dos@@ ing .
the safety and effectiveness of aer@@ ina@@ ze were not tested in patients with kid@@ ney or liver functioning and do not submit the data to address corresponding recommendations for dos@@ ing .
patients must be informed about that the treatment in the appearance of a hyper@@ tension or a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ the or of pal@@ aces , cardi@@ ac disorders ( like head@@ aches or strengthening of the head@@ aches ) must be set . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of the following patient groups , patients suffer from digi@@ alis • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with a m@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ inf@@ arkt in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , blowjob , or bron@@ cho@@ sp@@ as@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
Aer@@ ina@@ ze is final at least 48 hours before carrying out der@@ mat@@ ologi@@ c tests because anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka otherwise can prevent positive responses to indicators for skin reactions and reduce to their extent .
&quot; in the framework of clinical trials of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , in which Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , in addition , were not observed in clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions or changes of Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; with the results of the psych@@ o @-@ serv@@ o tests could not be significant differences between the associated patients with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and those with plac@@ ebo patients , regardless of whether des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone or with alcohol was taken . &quot;
&quot; it has not been identified for the met@@ abo@@ lic of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin responsi@@ bly enzy@@ me , so that inter@@ actions with other medicines can not be excluded completely . &quot;
&quot; Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not , and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bited and neither a sub@@ str@@ ate nor an In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ co@@ one . &quot;
&quot; the in@@ concei@@ vable of the use of aer@@ ina@@ ze during pregnancy is not secured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies , however , no increase in the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population . &quot;
&quot; as a reproduction of animal studies should not always be transferred to humans , and on the basis of vas@@ oc@@ on@@ stri@@ kt@@ or@@ ical characteristics of p@@ seud@@ o@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine should not be applied in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be clari@@ fied that in very rare cases it can lead to a imp@@ air@@ ment of transport or the ability to use machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a Z@@ NS Depression ( Se@@ coding , Ap@@ no@@ e , decre@@ ased mental attention , com@@ an@@ osis , com@@ a , cardi@@ ovascular disease ) and a tick @-@ stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ) with possible let@@ als . &quot;

&quot; a Z@@ NS stimulation is particularly prob@@ able in children as well as At@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth@@ dry , p@@ up@@ ill@@ ary , and - di@@ lat@@ ation , Hau@@ ling , hyper@@ therm@@ ia and gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal symptoms ) . &quot;
this close both the in@@ hibition of the infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ern@@ al cycles as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ cells / Bas@@ op@@ hil@@ a as well as the in@@ scription of the expression of the addres@@ s@@ sm@@ ol@@ ec@@ ules P @-@ Sel@@ ect@@ tin to end@@ ot@@ hel@@ mets . &quot;
&quot; for single dose of a single dose with adults showed Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg no influence on standard sizes of the flight , including the ampli@@ fied hoses or the tasks that are connected to the thread . &quot;
in controlled clinical trials was found in the recommended dosage of 5 mg a daily inci@@ dence of s@@ fri@@ ction compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; the or@@ ale application of Pseud@@ o@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can give other person@@ om@@ im@@ e@@ tic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a T@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ die or manifest@@ ations of a Z@@ NS arous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; they took 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seas@@ onal allergi@@ c Rhin@@ itis , where 414 patients Aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets were received . &quot;
&quot; in both studies the hist@@ amine effect of aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets , determined by the total sc@@ ores for the symptoms ( except nas@@ al membran@@ e sw@@ elling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ seud@@ o@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine on the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
the effectiveness of aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets with regard to the ab@@ sw@@ elling effect , determined by the nas@@ al skin sw@@ elling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
the effectiveness of aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic group of patients . &quot;
as part of a single dose of the phar@@ ma@@ co@@ ine@@ tic study of Aer@@ ina@@ ze is des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin within 30 minutes after administration of plas@@ ma .
&quot; after the per@@ or@@ al application of aer@@ ina@@ ze at healthy Pro@@ ban@@ den over 14 days the flow @-@ weight of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and p@@ seud@@ o@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine on day 10 . &quot;
&quot; as part of a phar@@ ma@@ co@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ professional study study , which was performed with the form@@ ulation as a tablet to healthy grown pro@@ ban@@ den was determined that four Pro@@ ban@@ ders Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is un@@ mist@@ ak@@ eable . &quot;
a single @-@ response study shows that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) by Pseud@@ o@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the all@@ one of p@@ seud@@ o@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio@@ degra@@ dation was equivalent to the Ex@@ position of a aer@@ ina@@ ze tablet .

A@@ eri@@ us was studied in total eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and young people with allergi@@ c Rhin@@ itis ( including four studies with seas@@ onal allergi@@ c and two studies on patients that also have as@@ thma ) .
&quot; the effectiveness was measured by changing the change of symptoms ( it@@ ch , number and size of the square , imp@@ air@@ ment of the sleep and performance of the day ) before and after six@@ teenth treatment was established . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been submitted to im@@ ply that the body determines the sy@@ rup , the solution to one and the mel@@ ting items in the same way , as the tablets and application in children are harm@@ less . &quot;
&quot; allergi@@ c Rhin@@ itis led when the results of all studies have been assembled , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us to an average decrease of the sy@@ mptom@@ sc@@ ores ( sy@@ mptom@@ sc@@ ores ) at 25 to 32 % , compared to the acceptance of 12 to 26 % in the patients who received a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies at Ur@@ tik@@ aria was the acceptance of the sy@@ mptom@@ sc@@ ores after six@@ teenth treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % compared to plac@@ ebo patients . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us must not be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergi@@ c ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , Lor@@ at@@ adin or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; January 2001 , the European Commission Decision of the company SP Europe make a permit for the use of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; one tablet every day , with one or without a meal , to the relief of symptoms in allergi@@ c Rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mit@@ ting and pers@@ ist allergi@@ c rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see below section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there is limited experience of clinical trials for effectiveness in the application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in young people from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ing allergi@@ c Rhin@@ itis ( appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be termin@@ ated according to the previous sense of disease and can be res@@ um@@ ed after completion of symptoms and will be res@@ um@@ ed with their re @-@ return .
with the Persian allergi@@ c Rhin@@ itis ( appearance of symptoms to 4 or more days per week and over 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during all@@ ergy time treatment .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not found in clinical studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin tablets not specified when Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol can be found in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clin@@ ically @-@ phar@@ ma@@ cological study was not reinforced by as@@ eri@@ us and alcohol the high @-@ performance effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; however , patients should be clari@@ fied that in very rare cases , it can lead to imp@@ air@@ ment of transport or the ability to use machines . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials in various indications , including allergi@@ c Rhin@@ itis and chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , were reported by the recommended dose of 5 mg a day 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side @-@ side effects , about the more common than in plac@@ ebo were tired@@ ness ( 1,2 % ) , mouth@@ dry ( 0,@@ 8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0,@@ 6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with 578 youth@@ ful patients from 12 to 17 years was the most common secondary effect of head@@ ache , these entered into 5.4 % of patients who have been treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and treated with 6.6 % of patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ disciplinary study , with up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nin@@ et@@ een clinical dose ) have been applied , were not clin@@ ically relevant effects observed . &quot;
this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ s cy@@ tok@@ ens like IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ cells / Bas@@ op@@ hil@@ a as well as the in@@ scription of the expression of the ad@@ diction sm@@ ol@@ ec@@ ular cells . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study involving multi @-@ disciplinary study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of up to 20 mg a day over 14 days has been administ@@ ered over 14 days , has not been statis@@ tically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardi@@ ovascular effect . &quot;
&quot; in a clin@@ ically @-@ phar@@ ma@@ cological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of 45 mg a day ( the Ne@@ un@@ ple of the clinical dose ) over ten days showed itself , not an extension of the Q@@ T@@ c Inter@@ v@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; in a single dos@@ er study with adults showed Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg no influence on standard sizes of the flight , including the ampli@@ fied hoses or the tasks that are connected to the thread . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergi@@ c Rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the relief of symptoms such as Ni@@ ese , nose sec@@ re@@ tion and it@@ ch of the nose , it@@ ch , dre@@ aming and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ch at the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in sa@@ ison@@ al and Per@@ enni@@ al , the allergi@@ c Rhin@@ itis can be shared depending on the duration of symptoms , as well as in inter@@ mit@@ ting allergi@@ c Rhin@@ e@@ itis and pers@@ ist Rhin@@ oplast@@ y . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ing allergi@@ c Rhin@@ itis is defined as a appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persist@@ ent allergi@@ c Rhin@@ itis is defined as a appearance of symptoms to 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
as shown by the overall sc@@ ores of the ques@@ tionna@@ ire concerning the quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ Con@@ junk@@ ti@@ vi@@ tis was shown to decre@@ ases A@@ eri@@ us effectively the allergi@@ c rhin@@ itis .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria was a substitute for further forms of the Ur@@ tik@@ aria since the underlying path@@ physi@@ ology dis@@ ir@@ respective of e@@ ti@@ ology with different forms is similar and chronic patients can become easier .
&quot; as the history of hist@@ ological disease is expected , is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is expected also with the chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , even in other forms of the Ur@@ bino to an improvement of symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving as@@ ur@@ itus and the degra@@ dation of size and number of squares at the end of the first dos@@ es . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with Anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka in chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the minority of patients who do not re@@ acted on Anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka , from the study . &quot;
an improvement of the it@@ ching to more than 50 % has been observed at 55 % of the patients with disaster to be treated with plac@@ ebo patients compared to 19 % of the plac@@ ebo patients .
&quot; the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disorder of sleep and vig@@ il@@ ly significant , as being measured by a 4 @-@ score on evalu@@ ating these variables . &quot;
&quot; in a phar@@ ma@@ co@@ ine@@ tic study , where patients can be compared with the general seas@@ onal allergi@@ c Rhin@@ e@@ itis population , was achieved by 4 % of patients a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
there are no clu@@ es for a clin@@ ically relevant Kum@@ ulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days before .
&quot; however , that in the met@@ abo@@ lic of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin responsi@@ bly enzy@@ me has not yet been identified , so that inter@@ actions with other medicines will not be excluded completely . &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin shirt in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bited and neither a sub@@ str@@ ate nor an In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cot@@ ic .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of the meals to prevent symptoms in allergi@@ c Rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mit@@ ting and pers@@ ist allergi@@ c rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see below section 5.1 ) .
the prescription doctor should be aware that most cases of Rhin@@ oplast@@ y can be caused by an infection ( see below 4.4 ) and that no data are pre@@ dest@@ ined to support a inf@@ ectious Rhin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respir@@ atory infections , or anatom@@ ical an@@ om@@ ali@@ es should play a role in diagnos@@ ing the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , physical investigations and appropriate laboratory and skin effects . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years met@@ aboli@@ ze Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and find out a higher sub@@ st@@ acy ( see under section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Si@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , the restricted met@@ aboli@@ ze , is identical to those in children which are normal yet met@@ aboli@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains Sac@@ char@@ se and Sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients should not take with her@@ edit@@ ary problems of a fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glu@@ co@@ se @-@ Gal@@ act@@ osis , or a Sac@@ char@@ ase Is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ fertility . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not observed in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets were not specified when Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol can be found in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clin@@ ically @-@ phar@@ ma@@ cological study was not reinforced by as@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol the high @-@ performance effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall effects of side @-@ effects in children from 2 to 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Si@@ rup group as well as the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; in clinical studies with adults and young people in various indications , including allergi@@ c Rhin@@ itis and chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , were reported in the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study on adults and adoles@@ cents , with up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nin@@ et@@ een clinical dose ) have been applied , were not clin@@ ically relevant effects observed . &quot;
children aged between 1 and 11 years old for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy has been received from 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergi@@ c Rhin@@ itis / chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adults and children can be similar to the effici@@ encies of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adults on the children population .
&quot; as part of a clinical study with multi @-@ disciplinary study of adults and adoles@@ cents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days has been used to be statis@@ tically significant , or clin@@ ically relevant cardi@@ ovascular effect . &quot;
&quot; in a clin@@ ically @-@ phar@@ ma@@ ological study of adults and young people , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of 45 mg a day ( the Ne@@ un@@ ple of clinical dose ) has been used for ten days at adults , not an extension of the Q@@ T@@ c Inter@@ v@@ alls . &quot;
in controlled clinical trials was found in the recommended dosage of 5 mg a daily basis for adults and young people not increased frequency of s@@ fri@@ ction compared to plac@@ ebo .
with a single day dose of 7.5 mg resulted in A@@ eri@@ us tablets with adults and young people in clinical studies to no imp@@ air@@ ment of the psych@@ omot@@ ors .
&quot; in clin@@ ically @-@ phar@@ ma@@ ological studies of adults it came with simultaneous intake of alcohol neither to rein@@ forcement of alcohol induc@@ ed power , nor to an increase in the mud . &quot;
&quot; for adult and youth@@ ful patients with allergi@@ c Rhin@@ itis were as@@ eri@@ us tablets effective in the relief of symptoms such as Ni@@ ese , nose sec@@ re@@ tion and it@@ ch of the nose , it@@ ch , t@@ abo@@ lic and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ch at the pal@@ ate . &quot;
as shown by the overall sc@@ ores of the ques@@ tionna@@ ire concerning the quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ Con@@ junk@@ ti@@ vi@@ tis was shown to reduce A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively the allergi@@ c rhin@@ itis
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving as@@ ur@@ itus and the degra@@ dation of size and number of squares at the end of the first dos@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this restricted met@@ aboli@@ zed phenomenon , was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ cas@@ ier@@ n ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
similar phar@@ ma@@ co@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a phar@@ ma@@ co@@ ine@@ tic fac@@ e@@ osis study with the si@@ rup@@ form@@ ulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergi@@ c Rhin@@ itis .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was after 3 to 6 hours higher and the C@@ max approximately 3 to 4 times higher with a termin@@ als of about 120 hours .
there are no clu@@ es for a clin@@ ically relevant impact accumulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adoles@@ cents .
&quot; 12 In different single dose studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with the recommended dos@@ es comparable with those of adults , the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin @-@ si@@ rup in a dosage of 5 mg received . &quot;

&quot; in patients with allergi@@ c Rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in the relief of symptoms such as Ni@@ ese , nose sec@@ re@@ tion and it@@ ch of the nose , it@@ ch , dre@@ aming and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ch at the pal@@ ate . &quot;
in single dose @-@ crossover studies by A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg mel@@ ting tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or as@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at for inser@@ ts the form@@ ulations was equivalent .
the overall analysis of the preventive and clinical trials tests for the mel@@ ting tablet that this form@@ ulation represents an un@@ likely risk for local ir@@ rit@@ ations in clinical application .
&quot; the safety of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in children between 2 and 11 years , the restricted met@@ aboli@@ ze , is identical to those in children which are normal yet met@@ aboli@@ ze . &quot;

the overall effects of side @-@ effects in children from 2 to 11 years was similar to the di@@ lor@@ at@@ adin group similar to the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; on children between 6 and 23 months the most common side @-@ side effects were reported on the more common than in plac@@ ebo , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( 3,@@ 7 % ) , f@@ ever ( 2,3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ( 2,3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study were observed at a single dose of 2.5 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin solution for taking no side effects in patients aged between 6 and 11 years . &quot;
in the recommended dos@@ es were the Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ concent@@ rations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( see section 5.2 ) in the children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical trials was found in the recommended dosage of 5 mg a daily basis for adults and young people not increased frequency of s@@ fri@@ ction compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in addition to the established classification in sa@@ ison@@ al and Per@@ enni@@ al , the allergi@@ c Rhin@@ itis can vary depending on the duration of symptoms , as well as in inter@@ mit@@ ting allergi@@ c Rhin@@ itis and &quot;
as shown by the overall sc@@ ores of the ques@@ tionna@@ ire concerning the quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ Con@@ junk@@ ti@@ vi@@ tis was shown to reduce A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively the allergi@@ c rhin@@ itis ret@@ ained by seas@@ onal allergi@@ c rhin@@ itis .
&quot; the spread of this restricted met@@ aboli@@ zed phenomenon , was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ cas@@ ier@@ n ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; as A@@ eri@@ us solution for taking the same concentration on Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , there was no bio @-@ valence study , and it is expected to be expected that they corresponds to the sy@@ rup and tablets . &quot;
&quot; in different single dose studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with the recommended dos@@ es were comparable with those of adults , the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin @-@ Si@@ rup in a dosage of 5 mg . &quot;

June 2008 shared Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. committee ( CH@@ MP ) officially launched the company for Human@@ it@@ un@@ ov to prevent the avi@@ ation of the avi@@ our H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
&quot; A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be caused by adults and older people to protect the flu , caused by the tribe ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of influ@@ enza @-@ A @-@ virus . &quot;
&quot; this is a special kind of vaccine , which could cause a trunk of the flu , which could cause a future p@@ and@@ emic . &quot;
&quot; a influ@@ enza p@@ and@@ emic breaks out when a new trunk of the flu , which can easily spread from person to man because people do not have immun@@ ity ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; after agreement of the vaccine , the immune system is recognis@@ ing the immune system the parts of the flu @-@ virus as &quot; &quot; physically &quot; &quot; and forms an anti@@ body against it . &quot;
&quot; thus , the immune system later is able to form in contact with a Gri@@ ec@@ virus this pedi@@ gre@@ e of the ordinary anti@@ bodies . &quot;
&quot; afterwards , the membran@@ es gro@@ mm@@ et of the virus with the &quot; surface surface &quot; ( proteins on the membran@@ e surface , which det@@ ects the human body as a body @-@ off ) , certified and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot;
&quot; a inspection of some of the study centers showed that the study was not done according to the &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot;
the scope of the clinical data base for evalu@@ ating the safety of the vaccine not to fulfill the requirements of the guidelines of the EME@@ A for preventive vacc@@ ines .
&quot; should you take part in a clinical trial and need more information about your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you desire further information on the basis of recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is applied in combination with other anti@@ vi@@ ral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are caused by the human@@ en immun@@ ity level of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which are caused by the acquired Immun@@ e De@@ ficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who can not swal@@ low the capsules , there is as@@ gener@@ ase may be taken as a solution to income , but this cannot be taken together with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r since the security of this combination was not investig@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should only be removed if the doctor has been tested , which anti @-@ vir@@ ral medicines of the patient has been taken before , and the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood has been judged that the virus is being examined . &quot;
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily that can be taken along with twice daily 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ vi@@ ral medicines .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg the recommended dose of as@@ gener@@ ase after the body weight .
A@@ gener@@ ase reduced in combination with other anti@@ vi@@ ral medicines the HIV amount of blood and keeps them at a low level .
&quot; AIDS not to heal , however , cannot delay the damage of the immune system and thus the development of with AIDS connected infections and diseases . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in combination with other anti@@ vi@@ ral medicines , but without rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 736 HIV @-@ infected adults , which had not been treated with prot@@ eas@@ eh@@ em@@ ania . &quot;
&quot; that with low do@@ si@@ ert@@ em Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased medicine A@@ gener@@ ase was taken with 206 adults , who had taken formerly prot@@ eas@@ eh@@ em@@ mer , with other prot@@ eas@@ eh@@ em@@ ania . &quot;
main indic@@ ator for the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with not veri@@ fiable concent@@ rations of HIV in the blood ( vir@@ us@@ load ) or the change of vir@@ us@@ load after treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had had taken no prot@@ eas@@ eh@@ em@@ mer , even after 48 weeks under A@@ gener@@ ase more patients had a Vir@@ us@@ load under 400 copies / ml than at plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; for children , A@@ gener@@ a also has been reduced the Vir@@ us@@ load , but with the children , which were treated earlier with prot@@ eas@@ eh@@ em@@ ania , only very few to the treatment . &quot;
in the study with adults who were treated earlier with prot@@ eas@@ eh@@ em@@ ania who were treated with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced medicine A@@ gener@@ ase after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ eas@@ eh@@ em@@ mer :
&quot; in the patients with HIV , that was against four other prot@@ eas@@ eh@@ em@@ mer resistant , there came under A@@ gener@@ ase together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a greater waste after four weeks when in patients who participated their former prot@@ esters : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed if more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , Di@@ ar@@ rh@@ ö ( di@@ arr@@ ings ) , Flat@@ ul@@ ency ( Bl@@ essing ) , break @-@ r@@ ash , r@@ ash and Fatigue ( tired@@ ness ) . &quot;
&quot; 2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied in patients , which may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergi@@ c ) against Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied in patients who are being applied to patients ( a herbal preparation for treating depression ) or medicines that are just as asylum , and are in high concent@@ rations in the blood of health harmful . &quot;
&quot; as with other drugs against HIV exists for patients , the as@@ gener@@ ase , the risk of a li@@ po@@ dy@@ stro@@ phy ( die of bone tissue ) or a immune response ( symptoms of an infection , caused by the relaxing immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee for Human@@ ity grew up to the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral medicines for the treatment of with prot@@ eas@@ eh@@ em@@ atic drugs used to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ in@@ fic@@ ated adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the phar@@ ma@@ co@@ ine@@ tic amplifier , but the Committee adopted that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are taken in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; exceptional circumstances , as at the time the approval for scientific reasons only limited information . &quot;
October 2000 the European Commission sent to the G@@ la@@ x@@ o Group Limited as a permit for the use of as@@ gener@@ als throughout the European Union .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1- in@@ fic@@ ated , prot@@ eas@@ eh@@ em@@ mer ( PI ) -@@ treat@@ able adults and children from 4 years . &quot;
for usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules to phar@@ ma@@ co@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sting of Am@@ bo@@ avi@@ r can be administ@@ rated with low dos@@ es of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r should be taking into account the individual vir@@ al resistance and the pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take is 14 % less than cap@@ f@@ avi@@ r . therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution to inser@@ tion on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base is not inter@@ change@@ able ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral medicines .
2 . if A@@ gener@@ ase capsules will be applied without the reinforced addi@@ tives from Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booklet ) must be applied higher dos@@ es of ap@@ ur@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
&quot; the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral medicines , up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r that should not be exc@@ eeded ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; the phar@@ ma@@ co@@ ine@@ tic , effectiveness and safety of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low dos@@ es of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ eas@@ eh@@ em@@ ania were not examined . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the mal@@ ign@@ ity of data for harm@@ lessness and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
based on phar@@ ma@@ co@@ ine@@ tic data should reduce the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult suffer@@ ers in adult suffer@@ ers to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions on 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application is intended to treat patients with mild or moderate liver functioning with caution in patients with severe liver functioning , it is contra@@ dic@@ ated ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with pharmaceu@@ ticals which possess a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ate of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal supplements that include Johann@@ is@@ k@@ ell ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to risk reduction of plas@@ ili@@ avi@@ r during the intake of am@@ ath@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be pointed out that A@@ gener@@ are or any other anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opport@@ un@@ istic infections or other comp@@ lications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase prevents not preventing the risk of transfer@@ ring HIV to others through sexual contact or cont@@ am@@ ination with blood .
for usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used together with low dos@@ es from Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients who suffer from chronic hep@@ atitis B or C and have been treated with anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral Com@@ bination therapy and have increased risk for heavy hep@@ atic impacts of pot@@ entially dead@@ ly history .
in the case of simultaneous anti@@ vi@@ ral treatment of hep@@ atitis B or C please read the concerned information of this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing reduced liver function including a chron@@ ically active hep@@ atitis demonstrate an increased frequency of liver dys@@ functions under a anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral building therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
&quot; the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ are and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on or other Glu@@ co@@ o@@ or@@ o@@ ids , that is not recommended that the potential benefits of treatment is systematic cor@@ tik@@ ost@@ ero@@ i@@ der effects including mor@@ bus Cus@@ hing and Supp@@ ression of the out@@ patient function ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the contr@@ ac@@ eption of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duction t@@ ase @-@ Hem@@ mer Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is a simultaneous agreement with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin due to the increased risk of myth@@ ia including ra@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , Phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ ine , tri@@ cyc@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ ring ( under supervision of the International standardi@@ zation ratio ) , are available methods for determining the agents concentration . &quot;
&quot; in patients who take these medicines at the same time , as@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective because of decre@@ ased plas@@ mas@@ cul@@ t ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of met@@ aboli@@ zed inter@@ actions with am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al cont@@ ex@@ changes can be changed , but the information is not sufficient to estimate the kind of inter@@ actions . &quot;
&quot; when Meth@@ ad@@ on simultaneously is given by Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ iat@@ ry sy@@ mpt@@ om , particularly when there are also low dos@@ es of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; because of the possible risk of a toxic@@ ity , due to the high prop@@ yl@@ ism of the as@@ gener@@ ative solution to the one is contra@@ dic@@ ated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution at certain other patients . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be placed on duration 5 , when a r@@ ash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergi@@ c symptoms , or the mu@@ co@@ us membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral therapy including prot@@ eas@@ eh@@ em@@ mer , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emic , or an ex@@ ac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing Diabetes Mell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases to their therapy medicines which were associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or a hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emic .
&quot; B. higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer and@@ ro@@ de anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral treatment and the associated met@@ abo@@ lic disorders . &quot;

&quot; although a multi@@ fact@@ orial ap@@ ti@@ ology is accepted ( including use of cor@@ tik@@ ost@@ o@@ ids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ sion , higher Body @-@ mass @-@ index ) , cases of O@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral Com@@ bin@@ ary therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ate with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with pharmaceu@@ ticals which have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ate of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ es 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase may not be trac@@ ed together with pharmaceu@@ ticals and their active ingredients can be trac@@ ed mainly via CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and for the increased plastic level with serious and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C caused by Am@@ ag@@ avi@@ r caused to lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to a resistance development .
&quot; in trying , the lowest plas@@ mas@@ cul@@ ars in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be observed in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were observed very often un@@ wanted effects on the liver . &quot;
Johann@@ is@@ k@@ ell ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The Ser@@ um mirror of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r can be brought out by the simultaneous application of herbal supplements with Johann@@ is@@ k@@ ish ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; when a patient takes before Johann@@ is@@ k@@ ell , are the am@@ ath@@ avi@@ ties and if possible to verify the Vir@@ us@@ load and liber@@ ate the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ um . &quot;
a dosage adjustment for one of the medication is not required when N@@ el@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administ@@ ered along with Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ch ) .
&quot; 508 % increases , for C@@ max against 30 % lower than rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , dos@@ es were applied by 600 mg of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which defines the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this treatment . &quot;
52 % lower if Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
&quot; the C@@ min @-@ values of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; a dosage for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r and Cal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , there will be a eng@@ aging supervision , as the effectiveness and in@@ comprehen@@ sibility of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; there was no phar@@ ma@@ co@@ ine@@ tic study conducted in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but it is recommended due to the ant@@ a@@ zi@@ dis component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ a ( see ant@@ acid below ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , at Gab@@ e of E@@ f@@ avi@@ ties in combination with Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dosage adjustment is required . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ um in combination with Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , since the exposure of both prot@@ eas@@ eh@@ em@@ mer would be low . &quot;
the effect of ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in to other prot@@ eas@@ eh@@ em@@ mer and available limited data can be dism@@ is@@ sed that Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in the Ser@@ um@@ kon@@ zentration may possibly be sen@@ sed .
&quot; if this medicine should be used at the same time , caution is recommended as Del@@ avi@@ rd@@ in because of the decre@@ ases or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plas@@ mas@@ cul@@ ars could be less effective . &quot;
&quot; when these medicines will be applied together ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical surveillance should be done , because an exact pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous Gab@@ e of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 193 % and thus to a rise in with Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin related side effects .
&quot; if it is required for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , becoming a reduction in the dosage of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dose , although there is no clinical data . &quot;
&quot; phar@@ ma@@ co@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not carried out , but the plas@@ mas@@ cul@@ ars of both drugs could be increased in case of simultaneous administration . &quot;
simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily led to an increase in the C@@ max of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once a day compared to the value that has been observed after 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily without simultaneous use of fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , Hem@@ mer or in@@ duction of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , if they are being applied together with A@@ gener@@ ase , possibly to inter@@ actions . &quot;
patients should therefore be monitored on tox@@ ic responses to be monitored with these drugs when they are applied in combination with as@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ eas@@ eh@@ em@@ mer it is advis@@ able that ant@@ acid is not taken at the same time as as@@ gener@@ ase , as there can be res@@ or@@ ous disorders . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of anti@@ qu@@ vul@@ va , which are known as enzy@@ min@@ ants ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r can lead to a reduction of plas@@ mas@@ cul@@ t of Am@@ bo@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; the Ser@@ um @-@ concent@@ rations of calcium @-@ agates like Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ u@@ pin , Nic@@ or@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ o@@ pin , Nis@@ o@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be raised 10 by am@@ ot@@ avi@@ r , causing the activity and toxic@@ ity of this medicine . &quot;
simultaneous intake with as@@ gener@@ ase can increase their Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ concent@@ rations in conjunction with PD@@ E@@ 5 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors in conjunction with PD@@ E@@ 5 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors in conjunction with hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision dys@@ functions and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , in the rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ prop@@ ion@@ ate int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days at Pro@@ ban@@ c ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days at Pro@@ ban@@ c ( 4 times ) by approximately 86 % away ( 90 % -@@ Con@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ inter@@ vall 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; consequently , the simultaneous gifts of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended that the potential benefits of treatment is the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ tical corro@@ sive effects ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; at H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A Re@@ duction t@@ ase @-@ Hem@@ m@@ osis such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , which is dependent strongly from CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are prono@@ unced enh@@ anc@@ ements of Plas@@ mas@@ cul@@ ars in simultaneous administration of as@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; as Plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ o Enh@@ anc@@ ements of this H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A Re@@ duction t@@ ase to My@@ opathy , including a r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of these medicines will not be recommended with Am@@ bo@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; there will be a common monitoring of the therapeutic concent@@ rations to stabili@@ zation the mirror , since the plas@@ mac@@ on@@ concent@@ rations of Cy@@ clo@@ spor@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased from am@@ ot@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied together with oral coll@@ az@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , during simultaneous use of as@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al mid@@ az@@ ol@@ am caution . &quot;
data at the simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mid@@ az@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ est@@ y@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors will prove to a possible increase in Plas@@ az@@ ol@@ am from Mid@@ az@@ ol@@ am to the 3@@ - up to 4 @-@ fold .
&quot; when Meth@@ ad@@ on together with Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r is going to be administ@@ ered , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ iat@@ ry sy@@ mpt@@ om , especially if there are also low dos@@ es of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; because of the slight neg@@ li@@ gence of historical foot@@ ing , currently no recommendation can be given as the Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ - dosage is to adjust if Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r is administ@@ rated at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ on . &quot;
&quot; at the same gift of War@@ ber@@ in or other or@@ al anti@@ bodies together with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation Ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of Atten@@ u@@ ation or rein@@ forcement of anti @-@ thro@@ mb@@ osis effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the effect of an extra administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contr@@ ac@@ ep@@ tive is not predic@@ table , therefore also alternative methods for contr@@ ac@@ eption . &quot;
a careful control of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cyc@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example D@@ esi@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended in simultaneous Gab@@ e of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
this medicine must be used during pregnancy only after careful consumption for the mother as compared to the possible risks for fet@@ us .
&quot; in the milk , Am@@ bo@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were proven , however , it is not known whether Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r is transferred to men into the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study on imp@@ air@@ ments , which was administ@@ ered by the em@@ bedding in the uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r , showed during breast@@ feeding time a decre@@ ased increase in the 12 body weight at night &apos;s income . &quot;
the further development of the off@@ spring including t@@ erti@@ lity and reproduction capacity was not affected by the administration of Am@@ ag@@ avi@@ r to the wom@@ tier .
the in@@ concei@@ vable of as@@ gener@@ ase was examined in adults and children from 4 years onwards in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral medicines .
most of the un@@ bi@@ ase @-@ related side effects were easily up to moderate , occurred early on and led to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events , not clari@@ fied whether they are applied in connection with the intake of as@@ gener@@ ase or another at the same time to HIV treatment . &quot;
&quot; most of the above @-@ side effects come from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with prot@@ eas@@ eh@@ em@@ ania not pre @-@ treated patients 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily . &quot;

in the study of AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : N = 107 ) on patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure more than 96 weeks the following prot@@ eas@@ eh@@ em@@ mer mut@@ ations on :
in gen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance @-@ based analyses gen@@ otyp@@ ical interpre@@ tations systems can be applied to shut@@ down the activity of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 @-@ algorith@@ m for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , L@@ 33@@ F , I@@ 62@@ V , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M , with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a decre@@ ased prob@@ ability of a vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) . &quot;
&quot; conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation@@ sm@@ uster , changes can be governed by additional data and it is recommended to always move the current interpre@@ tations systems for analysis of the results of resistance levels . &quot;
&quot; on ph@@ än@@ otyp@@ ical resistance @-@ based analyses , clin@@ ically vali@@ ant interpre@@ tations systems can be used in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ical data to estimate the activity of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
firms who distri@@ butes the diagnostic resistance patterns , have clin@@ ically @-@ phenomen@@ al Cut @-@ off@@ s ( separ@@ ations ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be applied to the interpretation of results of a resistance tests . &quot;
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ ath@@ avi@@ r associ@@ ative genetic patterns creates a certain cruci@@ ble resistant against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r that remains the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r but generally received .
&quot; there are currently data on cruci@@ fix@@ ture between Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ eas@@ eh@@ em@@ as for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resistance , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;

&quot; in the other way , Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r ret@@ ains its activity against some other prot@@ eas@@ eh@@ em@@ mer @-@ resistant insul@@ ates at ; the receipt of these activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance to the isol@@ ates . &quot;
timely treatment is recommended to hold the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in borders which can affect the following treatment of no@@ ble .
&quot; the proof of the effectiveness of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open trial ( Vir@@ us@@ load ≥ 1000 copies / ml ) , with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nu@@ cle@@ osi@@ dan@@ alog@@ a ( NR@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , So@@ C ) with a PI , pre@@ domin@@ antly with a lower rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
one hundred @-@ three @-@ three @-@ three ( s = 163 ) patients with a weight@@ ed virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one NR@@ TI were included in the sub @-@ study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ sub @-@ embarrass@@ ment of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in comparison to the So@@ C @-@ PI group with regard to the time @-@ ad@@ mitt@@ ism ( HIV @-@ 1 @-@ R@@ NA ) in the Plas@@ ma after 16 weeks in case of non @-@ sub @-@ pressure thres@@ hold of 0.@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the letter of the eff@@ ic@@ acy of un@@ curved A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with total 288 HIV @-@ in@@ fic@@ ated children aged 2 to 18 years old which were treated with PI .
&quot; in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase solution for one and capsules in dos@@ es of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; it was given no low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of the associated patients had previously been treated before at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) , together with A@@ gener@@ als adopted NR@@ TI@@ s . &quot;
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the study included a plas@@ ma HIV @-@ 1 @-@ R@@ NA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the output . &quot;
19 Bas@@ ing on these data should be considered at therapeu@@ tics optim@@ isation with PI pre@@ treated children of &quot; un@@ born &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase &quot; .
&quot; according to or@@ ous administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) up to maximum ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; 508 % increases , for C@@ max against 30 % reduced , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) together with Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the agreement of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % of withdrawal of AU@@ C but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ bo@@ avi@@ r 12 hours to dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in ste@@ ady @-@ State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ influenced by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake , the scale and rate of the Res@@ or@@ ption affects . &quot;
the seem@@ ing distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and leaves a large distributor volume as well as an enormous penetration of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r from the blo@@ od@@ stream into the tissues .
&quot; this change leads to a withdrawal of the total concentration of the ingredi@@ ent in the plas@@ ma , whereby the quantity of ir@@ led ants that represents the active part , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of impro@@ b@@ ed am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r remains unchanged , the percentage of free active component parts during the dos@@ ing concentration in ste@@ ady @-@ State in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State on the range of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines , the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ ing or inhi@@ bit or a sub@@ str@@ ate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with caution will be given , if they are given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see paragrap@@ hs 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r Ex@@ pos@@ ure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r is made up of the solution 14 % less bi@@ det , as of the capsules , therefore A@@ gener@@ ase Solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ change@@ able on a milli@@ meters . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r negl@@ ected , therefore the effect of a kid@@ ney failure to be low on the Eli@@ mination of Am@@ ag@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these treatment schem@@ ata lead to Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r @-@ Plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ ke comparable to those that achiev@@ es at healthy Pro@@ ban@@ den after a dose of 1200 mg Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r twice a day without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .

the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of the hep@@ at@@ cell@@ ular A@@ den@@ ome and kar@@ zin@@ ic has not yet been dis@@ solved and the relevance of these wat@@ ched effects for humans is un@@ clear .
&quot; from the present ex@@ posi@@ tions@@ data on human beings , both from clinical trials and the therapeutic application , however , however , little evidence for the acceptance of a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;

&quot; so far , in clinical studies have been observed in clinical trials in patients neither during the administration of as@@ gener@@ ase nor after the end of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; studies on the toxic@@ ity in juven@@ iles , which have been treated with the control of 4 days , showed both with the control and with amber used animals a high mort@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; in a system@@ ic plas@@ ma position , the significant exposure below ( rab@@ bits ) or not significant exposure among therapeutic dosage was observed , however , a number of minor changes including Th@@ y@@ mus@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and a small sk@@ elet@@ on changes have been observed in a del@@ ayed development . &quot;
24 When A@@ gener@@ ase capsules can be applied without the reinforced addi@@ tives from Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booklet ) must be applied higher dos@@ es of ap@@ ur@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
&quot; the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral medicines , up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r that should not be exc@@ eeded ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application is intended to treat patients with watch@@ ful or slight liver functioning with caution , in patients with severe liver functioning , it is contra@@ dic@@ ated ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medic@@ inal products , the serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening effects may cause , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , Phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ ine , tri@@ cyc@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ ring ( under supervision of the International standardi@@ zation Ratio ) , are available methods for determining the ingredi@@ ent concentration . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase should be placed on duration 27 when a r@@ ash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergi@@ c symptoms . ( see Section 4.8 ) .
&quot; increased risk to a li@@ po@@ dy@@ stro@@ phy has been associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with pharmaceu@@ ticals and dependent factors , such as a longer and@@ ro@@ de anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral treatment and the associated met@@ abo@@ lic disorders . &quot;
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C caused by Am@@ ag@@ avi@@ r caused to lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to a resistance development .
&quot; 508 % increases , for C@@ max against 30 % lower than rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min @-@ values of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; a dosage for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r and Cal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , there will be a eng@@ aging supervision , as the effectiveness and in@@ comprehen@@ sibility of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ um in combination with Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , since the exposure of both prot@@ eas@@ eh@@ em@@ mer would be low . &quot;
&quot; when these medicines will be applied together ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical surveillance should be done , because an exact pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is required for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ a , becoming a reduction in the dosage of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin to be at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there is no clinical data . &quot;

&quot; in a clinical trial , in the rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ prop@@ ion@@ ate int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days at Pro@@ ban@@ c ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days at Pro@@ ban@@ c ( 4 times ) by approximately 86 % away ( 90 % -@@ Con@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ inter@@ vall 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; at the same gift of War@@ ber@@ in or other or@@ al anti@@ bodies together with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation Ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of Atten@@ u@@ ation or rein@@ forcement of anti @-@ thro@@ mb@@ osis effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg Eth@@ in@@ yl@@ est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ ind@@ ron ) led to a withdrawal of AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ bo@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
this medicine must be used during pregnancy only after careful consumption for the mother as compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
&quot; a reproduction study on imp@@ air@@ ments , which was administ@@ ered by the em@@ bedding in the uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding of Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r , showed during breast@@ feeding time a decre@@ ased increase in the body weight at night &apos;s income . &quot;

&quot; in the other way , Am@@ f@@ avi@@ r ret@@ ains its activity against some other prot@@ eas@@ eh@@ em@@ mer @-@ resistant insul@@ ates at ; the receipt of these activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance to the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on these data should be considered in the therapy optimization with PI pre@@ treated children of &quot; &quot; un@@ geb@@ oo@@ st@@ ert@@ em &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; however , from the present ex@@ posi@@ tions@@ data on human beings , both from clinical trials and the therapeutic application has however little evidence for the adoption of a clinical relevance of this evidence . &quot;

&quot; during an application of Im@@ i@@ quim@@ od @-@ Cre@@ me in higher than the recommended dos@@ es , there has been enhanced risk for heavy local bar@@ r@@ ons ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases also observed a treatment of severe local bar@@ ir@@ rit@@ ation caused a treatment and / or to a temporary physical imp@@ air@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the outcome of the ure@@ th@@ ra , some women had difficulties when water@@ falls , which was required a emergency relief and a treatment of the affected area . &quot;
the application of Im@@ i@@ quim@@ od cre@@ ams directly following a treatment with other k@@ ut@@ an application for the treatment of external f@@ eig@@ ners in the genital and peri@@ al range has not been a clinical experience .
&quot; limited data refers to a increased rate of f@@ eig@@ war@@ ts re@@ productions on HIV @-@ positive patients , Im@@ i@@ quim@@ od @-@ Cre@@ me has shown a lower efficiency in this patient . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of the bas@@ so@@ cin@@ oma of Im@@ i@@ quim@@ od with Im@@ i@@ quim@@ od within 1 cm to the eyel@@ id , the nose , lips or hair loss has not been investig@@ ated . &quot;
local skin reaction are common but the intensity of these reactions usually takes place in general during therapy or reactions form after completion of treatment with Im@@ i@@ quim@@ od cre@@ ams .
&quot; if it is necessary due to the complaints of the patient , or because of the sever@@ ity of the local skin reaction , a treatment period may be made of several days . &quot;
the clinical result of therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treatment of treatment approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; currently , no data on long term healing rates are available after the treatment of more than 36 months after the treatment should be held at super@@ fi@@ zi@@ ella Bas@@ al@@ cell@@ cardi@@ o other suitable treatments . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre@@ treated BC@@ C@@ s are not clinical experiences , therefore the application is not recommended in the treatment of tum@@ ors . &quot;
data from an open clinical trial point out that with large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) a lower prob@@ ability of response to the Im@@ i@@ quim@@ od therapy .
&quot; Im@@ i@@ quim@@ bo was not investig@@ ated for the treatment of act@@ inal Ker@@ at@@ ants , inside the nose or the ears or in the lips area . &quot;
there are only very limited data about the application of Im@@ i@@ quim@@ od for the treatment of act@@ inal ker@@ at@@ ants to anatom@@ ical spots outside the face and the scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the act@@ ine Ker@@ at@@ osis on the sub@@ poor and hands does not support the effectiveness in this field of use , therefore such application will not be recommended . &quot;
local skin reaction often occur on , but these reactions usually take in the course of therapy to intensity or go after the procedure of therapy with Im@@ i@@ quim@@ od cre@@ ams . &quot;
&quot; when local skin reactions to the patient cause great dis@@ comfort , or very strongly , the treatment can be susp@@ ended for some days . &quot;
&quot; out of the data of an open clinical study is emerging , patients with more than 8 AC@@ s are shown a lower rate of salvation than patients with less than 8 l@@ esi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; due to immun@@ ode@@ ant properties , Im@@ i@@ quim@@ od Cre@@ me should be applied with caution in patients who receive an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;

&quot; with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which are defined as any related inci@@ dence that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the In@@ fu@@ sion@@ ary ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be monitored eng@@ aging , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be made available in a reasonable clinical environment in the re@@ vit@@ ational equipment for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase @-@ 3 study , almost all patients Ig@@ G anti@@ bodies are to be formed against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the treatment of treatment . &quot;
patients who develop anti@@ bodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion conditional reaction must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; because little experience regarding the recovery of treatment after a leng@@ thy break , must be cau@@ tious due to the theore@@ tically increased risk reaction after a break of treatment . &quot;
60 minutes before starting the in@@ fusion with drugs ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ ships ) to minim@@ ize the potential appearance in@@ fusion responses .
&quot; in the event of mild or moderate @-@ related response , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / o@@ bu@@ pro@@ ps should be wo@@ und@@ ed and / or a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to the half of the in@@ fusion rate , where the reaction occurred . &quot;

primary outcomes for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the estimated FE@@ V and the absolute sal@@ ary in the 6 @-@ Min@@ ut@@ - Ge@@ ht@@ est .
all patients were subsequently rec@@ ted for an open @-@ label extension ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks therapy the al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients opposite the plac@@ ebo group to improve the lung function and the enclos@@ ure that is shown in the following table .
&quot; in the open extension study , an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in der@@ al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me Group and of 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me Group , as shown from the following table . &quot;
the acceptance of the estimated pro@@ cent@@ ric FE@@ V is not significant in this period of clin@@ ically not significant and the absolute lung vol@@ um@@ ina increased further proportional to the height of growing children .
&quot; from the 26 patients with a hep@@ at@@ eg@@ ed before the treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) , until the end of the study a normal living size . &quot;
within the first 4 weeks a serious dec@@ ay of the g@@ ag @-@ mirror in the Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ atin@@ in ) has been established until the study constant constant .
&quot; with regard to het@@ ero@@ gene@@ ous path@@ ologies , which was taken into account with the use of a combined repository , route in 6 @-@ minutes Ge@@ ht@@ est , Moving house ( 58 % ) , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration of 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
&quot; it was conducted a one @-@ year @-@ year @-@ 2 study conducted in which mainly the security and phar@@ ma@@ co@@ ine@@ tic of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was examined in the study at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years old ( 16 patients with heavy cl@@ amping form and 4 with the middle level form ) . &quot;
in four patients the dosage was increased because of elev@@ ated G@@ AG@@ - mirror in the Har@@ n in week 22 in the last 26 weeks on 200 E / kg .
&quot; for several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) established after the Z @-@ Score for this age group , the younger patients with the moderate delay form ( &lt; 2,5 years ) , and every 4 patients with the middle level of course . &quot;
in a phase 4 study studies have been carried out to phar@@ ma@@ aer@@ odynam@@ ic effects of different al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me metering schem@@ es on the G@@ ag @-@ mirror in the Har@@ n , the Living volume and the 6 @-@ minute Ge@@ ht@@ est . &quot;

A@@ lim@@ ta is being applied together with Cis@@ pl@@ atin ( a different drug against cancer ) if cancer is not res@@ ide ( drugs against cancer ) or &quot; Mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( by an surgery alone can &apos;t be removed ) and &quot; Mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( by an surgery alone can &apos;t be removed ) and &quot; Mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( with surgery alone ) is not easy to other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metastatic CR@@ C .
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not been treated before , in combination with Cis@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously used other chem@@ otherap@@ ies earlier than any therapy . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should take part during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta an Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fol@@ oric acid ( a vitamin ) and inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; when A@@ lim@@ ta is administ@@ ered along with Cis@@ pl@@ atin , in addition , before or after the gift of Cis@@ pl@@ atin in addition an &quot; Anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics &quot; ( medicines for stri@@ king ) and liqui@@ ds ( around a liquid hand ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood flow changes or when certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be decre@@ ased , depos@@ ited or the dosage will be reduced . &quot;
the active form of P@@ emet@@ rex@@ ed slow@@ ed the formation of DNA and R@@ NA and prevents the cells .
&quot; the transformation of P@@ emet@@ rex@@ ed into its active form goes easy to cancer cells in cancer cells , as in healthy cells , which leads to higher concent@@ rations of the active form of pharmaceu@@ ticals and a longer active period of cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the mal@@ ig@@ s Che@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ ox@@ oms was examined A@@ lim@@ ta in a capit@@ als of 456 patients , which had never received chem@@ otherapy against their disease before . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ commercial lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were treated in a study on 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , which previously had already been treated with chem@@ otherapy with the effects of Doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medicine against cancer ) . &quot;
A@@ lim@@ ta also was compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ in ( another medicine against cancer ) and both in combination with Cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study on 1 725 patients who had never received chem@@ otherapy for lung cancer .
&quot; patients who have been treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ pl@@ atin , survi@@ ved on average 12,@@ 1 month , compared with 9,@@ 3 months in the sole administration of Cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients who had previously received an chem@@ otherapy , was the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8,@@ 3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months at Doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , however , patients in which cancer did not fall into the plate epi@@ thel@@ ial cells , in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer over @-@ life cycle than with the compar@@ ative drug . &quot;
September 2004 the European Commission sent the company El@@ i Lil@@ ly Nederland B.@@ V. a permit for the launch of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
every thorough@@ fare has to be analy@@ zed with 4.2 ml 0.@@ 9 % iger so@@ dium l@@ ori@@ de solution ( 9 mg / ml ) - what a solution of 25 mg / ml results .
the corresponding volume of the necessary lec@@ tur@@ sis is taken from the through@@ put and with 0.@@ 9 % iger so@@ dium @-@ chl@@ ori@@ de solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml further ( see section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is shown in combination with Cis@@ pl@@ atin is shown to first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic bron@@ chi@@ al cardi@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is shown for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - kal advanced or metastatic non @-@ commercial bron@@ chi@@ al histori@@ ography ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body area ( KO@@ F ) adopted as intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of Cis@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours after completion of the P@@ emet@@ rex@@ ed@@ - In@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ small bronze kar@@ zin@@ om , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F extends as intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; for reduction of inci@@ dence and sever@@ ity of skin reaction must be given the day before and on the day of the P@@ emet@@ rex@@ ed gifts , as well as the day after treatment a cor@@ tik@@ ost@@ ero@@ id . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ emet@@ rex@@ ed must be taken at least 5 cans of fol@@ ks , and the intake must be continued during the whole treatment ceremony , as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ emet@@ rex@@ ed@@ - dosage . &quot;
patients must also have an in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first P@@ emet@@ rex@@ ed dose as well as after every third generation cycle .
&quot; in patients who receive P@@ emet@@ rex@@ ed , should be created before each Gab@@ e a complete blood picture , including a differenti@@ ation of the leu@@ co@@ cy@@ tes and a Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ative . &quot;
the al@@ kal@@ ine Phosp@@ hat@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ame @-@ Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( A@@ ST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ in @-@ Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should be ≤ 3 @-@ fold of the upper limit value . &quot;
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle must take place a dosage inspection at the beginning of the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ h@@ mat@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the predic@@ tive therapy .
&quot; after recovery , patients must be treated according to references in tables 1 , 2 and 3 will be treated for AL@@ IM@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with Cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of National Cancer Institute Common To@@ ic@@ ity Criteria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degrees 2 ble@@ eding .
&quot; should patients not develop @-@ h@@ mat@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ degrees 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the patient has to be interrupted by AL@@ IM@@ TA , up to the patient the value in front of the treatment &quot;
the treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA needs to be broken when in patients after 2 dos@@ is@@ tive toxic@@ ity or non @-@ h@@ mat@@ ological toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 appearance or so@@ - with the appearance of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies have no indication that in patients at the age of 65 years or in comparison to patients aged 65 years a raised ann@@ ot@@ or@@ atory risk .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to in@@ comprehen@@ siveness and effectiveness .
&quot; in clinical studies were necessary in patients with a cre@@ atin@@ in Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min no dosage adjustment necessary , which hin@@ ts for all patients recommended dosage adjustment . &quot;
the data base for patients with a cre@@ atin@@ ine clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients were examined with a live functionality of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ folding of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - border values and / or tran@@ sam@@ inas@@ en@@ sive ( in Ab@@ domin@@ ance of liver suffer@@ ings ) or &gt; 5.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in presence of liver suffer@@ ings ) , not specifically examined in the studies . &quot;
patients must be monitored with regard to Kno@@ - and P@@ emet@@ rex@@ ed should not be administ@@ ered to patients before whose absolute neutr@@ ro@@ yalty points again a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ st number has reached a value of ≥ 100.000 cells / mm ³ .
a dosage reduction for further cycles is based on the Na@@ dir of the absolute neutr@@ ality speed , Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ se and maximum non @-@ h@@ mat@@ ological toxic@@ ity as they observed in the prec@@ eding treatment cycles . ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in degrees 3 / 4 h@@ ä@@ mat@@ ological and non @-@ smoking toxic@@ ity such as Neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia , feb@@ r@@ ile Neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 Neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie became be@@ o- , if a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore all patients need to be dependent on P@@ emet@@ rex@@ ed patients treated , fol@@ klore and vitamin B@@ 12 as proph@@ y@@ - lak@@ tic measure for reduction @-@ borne toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to medium @-@ in@@ fertility ( Cre@@ atin@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ cy@@ ber acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and mind@@ es@@ - TEN@@ S 2 days after the therapy with P@@ emet@@ rex@@ ed ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; all patients , for which a therapy with P@@ emet@@ rex@@ ed is provided , the intake of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ term stay for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ emet@@ rex@@ ed ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients where these events occurred , corresponding risk factors for the appearance of ren@@ al events , including deh@@ ydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existence of hyper@@ tension or diabetes . &quot;
therefore in patients with clin@@ ically significant liqui@@ ds - accumulation in trans@@ cell@@ ular space a Dra@@ in@@ age of ergonom@@ ics before the P@@ emet@@ rex@@ ed treatment .
&quot; 5 serious cardi@@ ovascular events , including M@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ inf@@ arkt , and cerem@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events have been reported in clinical studies with P@@ emet@@ rex@@ ed occasionally , when this ingredi@@ ent usually has been administ@@ ered in combination with a different cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ical ingredi@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated Leben@@ shilfe ( except Gel@@ b@@ fi@@ eber , these vacc@@ ination is cont@@ amin@@ ated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage caused by P@@ emet@@ rex@@ ed , men should be advised before the treatment - g@@ inn , advice regarding the sperm conservation . &quot;
in patients with normal kid@@ ney @-@ function ≥ 80 ml / min ) can be high cans of non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ yl@@ ic anti@@ ph@@ yl@@ ic acid in high dos@@ es ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) to a reduced P@@ emet@@ rex@@ ed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the result of a multi @-@ multi@@ coloured adv@@ ancement of side effects .
&quot; therefore , caution is recommended when patients with normal kid@@ ney function ( Cre@@ atin@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high dos@@ es of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or Ac@@ e- ty@@ l@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ic acid in high dosage . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the treatment , on the day of therapy and mind@@ es@@ - TEN@@ S 2 days after the therapy with P@@ emet@@ rex@@ ed ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no data regarding the Inter@@ action@@ pot@@ entials as with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long sem@@ iconduc@@ tor , such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or Ro@@ fe@@ co@@ xi@@ b , the simultaneous application with P@@ emet@@ rex@@ sed for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ - x@@ ed avo@@ ided . &quot;
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual Vari@@ ability of the low @-@ level status during the disease and the possibility of inter@@ actions between or@@ al anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ zi@@ en and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chem@@ otherapy requires a increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alities ratio ) if the decision was made to treat the patient with or@@ als anti@@ oc@@ ag@@ ul@@ ani .
&quot; there are no data for the use of P@@ emet@@ rex@@ ed at pregnancy , but as with an@@ de@@ - ren an@@ tim@@ ent@@ ol@@ ites are expected for an application in the pregnancy severe birth @-@ def@@ ective . &quot;
&quot; P@@ emet@@ rex@@ ed should not be applied during pregnancy , except if the requirements for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage caused by P@@ emet@@ rex@@ ed , men should be advised before the treatment of treatment , advice regarding the sperm level . &quot;

&quot; the side effects of Or@@ list@@ at are mainly gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal nature and hang together with phar@@ ma@@ cological effect of pharmaceu@@ ticals , since the absor@@ ption of recorded fat is prevented . &quot;
the gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal effects were obtained from clinical studies with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporarily .

&quot; however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 @-@ ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , caution is offered at equal gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with pharmaceu@@ ticals which pro@@ long@@ ed the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ t@@ - interval is extended or which is up to such a renewal . &quot;
&quot; except in connection with another chem@@ otherapy , Alo@@ xi should neither be used in the days after chem@@ otherapy , nor for the treatment of nau@@ sea and testing . &quot;

in the group with the highest dosage shown similar frequencies of un@@ wanted events as in other dos@@ ing groups ; there were no dose @-@ ingredi@@ ent relationships to observe .
&quot; there were no Di@@ aly@@ sis studies , due to the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective therapy with an Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose . &quot;

results of studies with default em@@ eto@@ gen@@ er chem@@ otherapy and the study with strong em@@ eto@@ gen@@ er chem@@ otherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .

according to the evidence of clinical investigations Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the I@@ on@@ cological De@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation of the I@@ on@@ enk@@ an@@ als and extend the duration of the action potential .
&quot; the aim of the study conducted at 221 healthy Pro@@ positions , the evaluation of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of i@@ .v@@ . administ@@ ered Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single parts of 0,@@ 25 , 0,@@ 75 and 2,@@ 25 mg . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption After intra@@ ven@@ ous gift follows an initial withdrawal of Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ concent@@ rations a slow elimination of the body with an average termin@@ ology of about 40 hours .
the average maximum Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the Concent@@ ration period ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally in the entire dosage range of 0.@@ 3@@ - 90 μ g / kg in ges@@ tion and cancer victims dos@@ es .
&quot; after intra@@ ven@@ ous gifts of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 cans , the average of the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron @-@ Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ concentration at 42 ± 34 % . &quot;
&quot; from phar@@ ma@@ co@@ ine@@ tic sim@@ ulations is emphas@@ ized that at once daily Gab@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in 3 consecutive days reached total frequency ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) with the following unique intra@@ ven@@ ous obj@@ ection of 0,@@ 75 mg . however , the C@@ max after the deposits of 0,@@ 75 mg was higher . &quot;
about 40 % are eliminated via the kid@@ neys and some more 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ abo@@ lic met@@ abo@@ lic on less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on 5@@ HT@@ 3 rec@@ ept@@ or .
&quot; in @-@ vit@@ ro studies for met@@ abo@@ lic , showed that CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in reduced dimensions , the I@@ so@@ enz@@ me CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 at the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; Eli@@ mination After a intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have been found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the Ur@@ ine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
according to a unique intra@@ ven@@ ous bolt in Health@@ y was the total of 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
&quot; in patients with severe liver functioning , the termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ alb@@ eit and the average system@@ ic exposure with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , a reduction of the dosage is thus not justified . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies have been observed only according to ex@@ positions , which is considered sufficient over the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which indicates a low relevance for the clinical use . &quot;
10 out of pre@@ clinical trials made evidence that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block in very high concent@@ rations I@@ on@@ enk@@ an@@ cies who are involved in vent@@ ric@@ ular de@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and can extend the action @-@ level duration .
&quot; high cans of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dosage correspon@@ ded in about the 30@@ zzle of the therapeutic ex@@ position in humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to a multiplied inci@@ dence of Leb@@ ert@@ as , pit@@ u@@ it@@ ary , P@@ ank@@ re@@ as , S@@ ank@@ re@@ as , S@@ ank@@ re@@ as , not with mi@@ ce , but not with mi@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not completely known , but due to the used high dos@@ es and since Alo@@ xi is determined by humans for a unique application , the relevance of these results are being low for man . &quot;

after setting the treatment with al@@ ph@@ eon flame retard@@ ed the disease with more patients back than in the reference process ; it also had al@@ ph@@ eon more un@@ wanted effects .
&quot; apart from that , in the study the test results for the examination of the question , the drug is a immune response ( d. h. the body forms anti@@ bodies - special proteins - against drugs ) trigger , not suffici@@ ently vali@@ dated . &quot;
it can be applied to the treatment of Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( one with cr@@ ush@@ ing skin infection ) and small in@@ fic@@ ated Laz@@ er@@ ations ( risk or inter@@ sections ) .
&quot; al@@ tar@@ go is not to be used for treating infections , which were veri@@ fiable or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant st@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) , because Al@@ ar@@ go against this type of infections may not work . &quot;
&quot; al@@ tar@@ go may be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but for patients under 18 years of age may not exceed 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient is not talking about two to three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by block the bacter@@ ial st@@ bos@@ om@@ es ( the parts of the bacter@@ ial which are produced and inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main indic@@ ator of the effectiveness was carried out in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was elabor@@ ated after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.7 % ) of the 71 patients under plac@@ ebo spoke to the treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected Hau@@ tw@@ ences , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ exin similar response : if the results of both studies have been assembled in Hau@@ tw@@ und , talked about 90 % of the patients of both groups to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies however , however , that Al@@ tar@@ go was caused by the treatment of ob@@ scene ( ei@@ rec@@ ated hol@@ ograms in the body @-@ tissue ) or of infections that were subsequently caused by MR@@ SA , not effective enough . &quot;
the most common secondary effect with al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a maturity of the client .
&quot; the Committee for Human@@ ity is lifted up to the conclusion that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go in the short @-@ time treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections compared to the risks , • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • in@@ infected small Laz@@ ations , deter@@ rent or se@@ ated wo@@ unds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission sent to the G@@ la@@ x@@ o Group Ltd . a permit for the in@@ timacy of the Al@@ tar@@ go to the entire European Union . &quot;
patients with which shows no improvement within two to three days should still be examined and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in the event of a sensi@@ tiz@@ ing or heavy local ir@@ rit@@ ation by applying ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in Sal@@ be , the treatment is supposed to be carefully checked and an adequate alternative treatment of the infection . &quot;
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as Er@@ re@@ ger ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in secondary open wo@@ unds was the effectiveness of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in in patients with infections caused by a Meth@@ ic@@ illin resistance and hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) were in@@ sufficient .
&quot; an alternative therapy is supposed to be considered , if after a 2- to 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected place occurs . &quot;
the effect of the simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in and other top@@ ical resources on the same skin space has not been investig@@ ated and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
&quot; due to the small plas@@ mac@@ ia concent@@ rations , which were achieved for top@@ ical application on ab@@ ed skin or infected super@@ ficial wo@@ unds , is a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ scription in vi@@ vo ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
3 After simultaneous Gab@@ e of 2 times a day 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol increased the middle ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max to top@@ ical application of 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in sal@@ be on ab@@ ed skin of healthy grown men around 81 % .
&quot; due to the low system exposure to top@@ ical application in patients , dosage adjustment is not kept required when top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in during a system@@ ic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproduction of reproductive medicine and are in@@ sufficient in relation to a statement on the birth and the oc@@ tal / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
re@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy only if a top@@ ical anti @-@ bacter@@ ial therapy is clearly indic@@ ative and the use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in the gift of an systematic antibiot@@ ic .
&quot; when deci@@ ding whether the breast@@ feeding is continued / ended or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go continues , is between the benefit of st@@ ables for the baby and the benefit of the al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , the al@@ tar@@ go was used , the most commonly reported secondary effect of ir@@ rit@@ ation at the end of the place , which is about 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; mode Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in is a semi @-@ synthe@@ tic der@@ iv@@ ative of Ple@@ uro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by Fer@@ mentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Che@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
the hosts of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in is based on the sel@@ ective im@@ itation of bacter@@ ial protein synthesis through interaction at a certain bond of the 50@@ S sub@@ unit of bacter@@ ial Ri@@ bos@@ oms which diff@@ ers from the bond forms of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ rup@@ tive anti@@ bacter@@ ial substances .
data point out that the bond is involved in Bos@@ bos@@ om@@ ales protein L3 and lies in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales P @-@ binding place and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ as@@ e@@ zent@@ centre .
&quot; by connecting to this bind@@ ings inhi@@ bit Che@@ uro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ Transfer , block partial P @-@ binding and prevent the normal formation of active 50@@ S ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al elev@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; should be concei@@ ved on the basis of the local pre@@ valence of resistance to the use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in at least some inf@@ ectious forms , a consultation by experts should be targeted at least . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in the In @-@ vit@@ ro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in towards S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were delicate or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ illin . &quot;
in case of failure to treat S.@@ au@@ re@@ us should be considered the presence of tribes with additional virus factors ( like PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) .
res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults was placed 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in Sal@@ be daily under occ@@ lu@@ sion on intact and decre@@ ased skin for up to 7 days .
&quot; 516 patients ( adults and children ) , the 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days to top@@ ical treatment of secondary traumatic wo@@ unds , were obtained individual plas@@ map@@ le . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B ( diseases which affect the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years that are not im@@ mu@@ n against these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used as part of one of two dos@@ es existing vacc@@ ination with protection against hep@@ atitis B possibly only after appointments the second dose is achieved .
&quot; for this reason ambi@@ rix not only be used , if immun@@ isation exists a little risk of hep@@ atitis B infection , and is ensured that from two dos@@ es can be guided to the end of two dos@@ ing . &quot;
if a refres@@ her dose against hep@@ atitis A or B is desired , Ambi@@ rix or another hep@@ atitis C or -@@ B vaccine will be given . &quot;
vacc@@ ines take effect by raising the immune system ( the natural def@@ ect of the body ) . &quot;
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , recognis@@ es the immune system the virus and surface of anti @-@ surface as a &quot; foreign &quot; and generates anti@@ body against it . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as that since 1996 brought a Twin@@ 80 adults and since 1997 approved vaccine Twin@@ ars children .
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines will be applied to the protection against the same diseases , however Twin@@ 80 adults and Twin@@ rix children under one of three cans of existing vacc@@ ines will be applied . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix Adult identical ingredients , some of the data that supports the use of Twin@@ rix adult , also used as cover for the use of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indic@@ ator for the effectiveness was the proportion of the spirit@@ ually children who had developed a month after the last injection .
&quot; in an additional study with 208 children , the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared to an sixty @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix led at between 98 and 100 % of the spirit@@ ually children a month after the last injection for the development of protective anti@@ bodies against hep@@ atitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection from Ambi@@ rix in a six @-@ month and at a 12 @-@ month distance between inj@@ ections was similar .
&quot; the common side @-@ side effects of ambi@@ rix ( observed if more than 1 of 10 vaccine ) are head@@ ache , appeti@@ te , appeti@@ te , pain on the inj@@ ecting , red@@ ness , sail@@ ness ( tired@@ ness ) as well as availability . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix is allowed to react in patients that may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergi@@ c ) to the agents , one of the other components or ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) . &quot;
August 2002 the European Commission commissioned the company G@@ la@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ icals s.@@ a. a permit for the launch of Ambi@@ rix in the whole
the standardi@@ zed plan for the Grun@@ dim@@ mun@@ isation with ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ inations and the first dose at the date of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose is given .
&quot; if a refres@@ hing is required for hep@@ atitis A as well as for hep@@ atitis B , it can be covered with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ous vacc@@ ines or with a Com@@ bin@@ ational vacc@@ ination . &quot;
the anti @-@ hep@@ atitis with the Com@@ bin@@ ation of anti @-@ hep@@ atitis C ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ hep@@ atitis C @-@ virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) -@@ anti@@ bodies are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is not yet fully backed whether immun@@ om@@ ni@@ fied individuals who have addressed to a hep@@ atitis A@@ - vaccine as protection , as it may also be protected with no longer im@@ meas@@ urable anti@@ bodies possibly by the immun@@ ological memory . &quot;
3 As with all inj@@ uries should be available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lak@@ tic reaction after the gift of the vaccine appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring always immediately available .
&quot; if a quick protection against hep@@ atitis B is required , the standardi@@ zed basis is recommended , the 360 ELISA units form form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis C @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B @-@ surface . &quot;
&quot; with Hem@@ ati@@ cal patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , according to the Grun@@ dim@@ eri@@ zation under circumstances will not be achieved in the anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ ec@@ ular anti@@ bodies , so in these cases the gift of other vacc@@ ines can be required . &quot;
&quot; as a intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular appointments in the ges@@ ture must lead to an subtle imp@@ fer@@ ment , these inj@@ ections should be avo@@ ided . &quot;
&quot; at Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ie or blood circulation , Ambi@@ rix cannot be inj@@ ected , since it can occur in these cases to in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular gift . &quot;
if Ambi@@ rix had passed in the second life of a separate injection at the same time with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- and ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us , ac@@ ell@@ ul@@ hil@@ us t@@ ae type b @-@ vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / hi@@ b ) or with a combined mask , Mum@@ ps @-@ Rö@@ t@@ eln @-@ vaccine was enough , was the immune response to all anti@@ gens sufficient ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
patients on immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune def@@ ective must be gone out that may not be adequate immune response .
&quot; in a clinical trial , which was conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines of this form@@ ulation in adults , the inci@@ dence of pain , red@@ ness , sw@@ elling , mat@@ ernity , gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ itis , head@@ aches and f@@ ever comparable to the frequency , which was observed in the former Thi@@ om@@ ers@@ al and preser@@ v@@ ative vacc@@ ination . &quot;
clinical trials were founded by 20@@ 29 vaccine Ambi@@ rix on a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants in the age of 12 to including 15 years the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix had compared with the 3 dos@@ es Com@@ bin@@ ary elements .
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and strength at a calculation basis for a vaccine basis for a vaccine basis , but not on a calculation basis for each person . &quot;
&quot; pain was observed after the Gab@@ e of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.7 % of the Pro@@ ban@@ den , compared to 39,@@ 1 % in the pro@@ ban@@ den following the gift of a dose of 3 dos@@ es Com@@ bin@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; after the complete vaccine @-@ cycle 66@@ ,@@ 4 % of the Pro@@ ban@@ den , the Ambi@@ rix failed to get over pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % in the Pro@@ ban@@ den , which were shr@@ ink with the 3 @-@ dos@@ - Com@@ bination . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of Mat@@ ity was comparable ( d. h. over the entire vaccine cycle at 39,@@ 6 % of the Pro@@ ban@@ den , the Ambi@@ rix had compared to 36,@@ 2 % at the Pro@@ ban@@ den , which received the 3 @-@ dos@@ es Com@@ bin@@ ations . &quot;
the pre@@ valence pain and skill was small and comparable to that which was observed by appointment of the Com@@ bin@@ ary vacc@@ ination with the 3 dos@@ es vacc@@ ines .
&quot; in a compar@@ ative study at 1- until 11 @-@ year vaccine , the occurr@@ ence of local reaction and general respon@@ dents in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to that with the 3 @-@ dos@@ es combined with 360 ELISA units and the 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis C @-@ surface . &quot;
&quot; however , at the 6@@ - until 11@@ - J@@ ew , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix was a most common appearance of pain ( at inj@@ ections ) per dose , not per pro@@ band . &quot;
the proportion of vacc@@ ines that have heavy side effects during the 2 @-@ cans vacc@@ ines with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ cans vacc@@ ines with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ active hep@@ atitis C @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able hep@@ atitis C @-@ surface @-@ surface was statis@@ tically not different .
&quot; in clinical trials that were carried out at vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the Ser@@ oc@@ on@@ ver@@ sion@@ ates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 99.@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , for month 6 administ@@ ered dosage ( d. h. in month 7 ) . &quot;
the Ser@@ oc@@ on@@ ver@@ sion@@ ary for anti @-@ h@@ bs were 7@@ 4.3 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second to month 6 administ@@ ered dosage ( d. h. in month 7 ) .

&quot; with the 289 persons whose immun@@ ity was worth@@ while , the Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) against Hep@@ atitis B in the month 2 and 6 to Gab@@ e of the 3 dos@@ ages , significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the immune answers that have been achieved in a clinical comparison study at 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ , one month after completion of the full vaccine series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
in both studies the vacc@@ ines got either a 2 @-@ cans @-@ vacc@@ ines with ambi@@ rix or one 3 @-@ cans @-@ vacc@@ ines with a Com@@ bine blades with 360 ELISA units and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis C @-@ surface .
&quot; in people who were at the time of Grun@@ dim@@ mun@@ oni@@ zation between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs had been proven about at least 24 months after the immun@@ isation of Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vaccine . &quot;

in a clinical study at 12@@ - until including 15 @-@ year @-@ old could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs @-@ anti@@ bodies can be compared to immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6@@ - months vaccine .

&quot; hep@@ atitis C @-@ virus is usually transmitted by vir@@ us@@ hal@@ es foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other ways such as swimming in through waste water puri@@ fied waters . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark Ur@@ ine , a blue face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yellow@@ ing ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines Ambi@@ rix cannot protect completely before an infection with hep@@ atitis C or hep@@ atitis B virus , even if the complete vaccine has been completed with 2 dos@@ es . &quot;
if you are already infected with hep@@ atitis A@@ - or hep@@ atitis B @-@ virus ( although you / your child can not feel un@@ likely or sick / feel ) a vacc@@ ination could not prevent any disorder .
&quot; a protection against other infections that cause the liver compens@@ ate or symptoms that are similar to those after a hep@@ atitis C or hep@@ atitis C infection , cannot be convey@@ ed . &quot;
• If you have already been an allergi@@ c reaction to ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) .
an allergi@@ c reaction can be caused by ju@@ ck@@ ing r@@ ashes or ob@@ struction of the face or the tongue . • if you have occurred an allergi@@ c reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hep@@ atitis A or hep@@ atitis B . • If you have a severe infection with f@@ ever before you / your child .
&quot; • If you wish to have a protection against hep@@ atitis B ( i.e. within 6 months , and prior to the tender of the second vaccine ) . &quot;
with a possible risk of infection with hep@@ atitis B between the first and second imp@@ air@@ es the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccine with ambi@@ rix .
&quot; instead , he will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined Hep@@ atitis B and hep@@ atitis B vaccine ( 360 ELISA units of an formal hep@@ atitis C @-@ virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis C @-@ surface @-@ surface ) . &quot;
the second vacc@@ ination of this vaccine with reduced loss of effective components is usually given a month after the first dose and should give you a vaccine before end the vaccine .
&quot; sometimes Ambi@@ rix is suffering from persons who suffer from heavy blood circulation , under the skin and not in the muscle tissue . • If you are cap@@ tiv@@ ating your child because of a disease or treatment in your own physical waste . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases but the immune response to these people can not be suffici@@ ently needed so that a blood test can be necessary to see how strong the reaction to vacc@@ ination is .
21 S@@ ave you to your doctor if you have received your child further medicines ( including those who have received without cas@@ ing ) or if you have recently received it or Im@@ m@@ ung@@ lo@@ bul@@ ins ( anti@@ bodies ) or has planned or this is planned in the near future .
but it can be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hep@@ atitis A and B viruses .
&quot; if another vaccine should be given simultaneously with ambi@@ rix , should be covered in separate places and as possible as possible different li@@ mbs . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix should be administ@@ ered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lo@@ bul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine is still suffici@@ ently sufficient . &quot;
&quot; usually , ambi@@ ance is not administ@@ ered or n@@ ursing women , except there is urgent need to be covered both against hep@@ atitis A as well as hep@@ atitis B . &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergi@@ c reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( Anti@@ biot@@ ic ) .

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs to 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs to 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; on the basis of the data , which has become known for issu@@ ing the first approval for the author , represented by CH@@ MP the view that the benefit @-@ risk @-@ relationship for ambi@@ rix remains posi@@ tively . &quot;
&quot; however , Ambi@@ rix had only been placed in one member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this medicine is limited to the small patient position . &quot;
ammon@@ ium can also be used in patients at the age of more than a month with in@@ complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ def@@ ect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ium encephal@@ opathy ( brain compensation ) in the history of history .
ammon@@ ite is divided into meals - divided into several retailers among meals - swallow@@ ed under the food mixed or through a neuro@@ logi@@ sts ( thanks to the ab@@ dom@@ ini@@ qu@@ ests in the stomach of the stomach ) or a Nas@@ en@@ son@@ de ( by the nose in the stomach &apos;s leading hose ) .
it was not a compar@@ ative study since fail@@ ing could not be compared with another treatment or with plac@@ ebo ( a ru@@ medi@@ ation medication that could be compared without agents ) .
&quot; ammon@@ ium can also lead to appeti@@ te , a ab@@ nor@@ ful im@@ ra@@ ils in the blood , depression , bul@@ bs , man@@ sion , li@@ fes@@ sion , li@@ fer@@ ation , r@@ amp@@ er@@ ation , r@@ amp@@ er@@ ation , r@@ ash , un@@ pleas@@ ing body weight or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ y@@ sts ( CH@@ MP ) succeeded at the conclusion that fos@@ aps in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle to high ammon@@ ium health precau@@ tion prevents effectively .
&quot; ammon@@ ite was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , as due to the rar@@ ity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information on this medicine . &quot;
&quot; the use is manifest@@ ed in all patients , with which a complete end@@ ow@@ l is already manifest@@ ed in the new@@ born age ( within the first 28 life age ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with late manip@@ ulated form ( in@@ complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ def@@ ect , which is manifest@@ ed after the first life @-@ month , then there is an indication for use when in an@@ am@@ n@@ ese is a hyper@@ tension en@@ cep@@ tional encephal@@ opathy . &quot;
&quot; for inf@@ ants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with cany@@ ons , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form . &quot;
the daily dose is calculated individually taking into account the prot@@ est toler@@ ance and the development of the daily prot@@ ections of the patient .
&quot; after the previous clinical experience is the normal daily dose of so@@ dium gly@@ co@@ lic at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight above 20 kg as well as with her@@ ent and adults . &quot;
&quot; in patients , who suffer from an early fixed lack of carb@@ am@@ yl@@ phosp@@ hate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ sc@@ arb@@ am@@ yl@@ ase , is the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ lin or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0,@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day required . &quot;
patients with an ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ are lack of ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.3 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.4 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS tablets may not be administ@@ rated patients with cany@@ ons , as a risk for the creation of Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ zer@@ a , when the tablets reach no immediately into the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g of so@@ dium @-@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS therefore should therefore be used in patients with more sc@@ ended her@@ zin@@ ess or serious kid@@ ney @-@ efficiency as well as with so@@ dium @-@ and @-@ minded clinical states only with caution .
da met@@ abo@@ lic and ex@@ cre@@ tion of so@@ dium @-@ fer@@ but@@ yr@@ at about the liver and kid@@ neys is carried by AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS in patients with liver or kid@@ ney @-@ in@@ fertility only with extreme caution .
the significance of these results in terms of pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ dic@@ ated ( see 4.3 ) .
at sub@@ cut@@ aneous gifts of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate at young cattle ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) it came to a slow@@ ing of neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and an increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there also found a del@@ ayed matur@@ ation of cerem@@ onial syn@@ ap@@ sen and a decre@@ ased number of functional thr@@ ill@@ ers in the brain and thus a disability of de@@ growth .
&quot; it could not be observed if phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate at the people into the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS during the breast@@ feeding period is cont@@ amin@@ ated ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS entered at 56 % of the patients at least an un@@ wanted event ( AE ) and at 78 % of these un@@ wanted events , that they were not associated with AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS . &quot;
&quot; frequency is defined as follows : very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able tox@@ ic reaction to AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported from a 18 year old an@@ or@@ ec@@ tic patient , which developed a met@@ abo@@ lic encephal@@ opathy in conjunction with Lak@@ tat@@ azi@@ qu@@ ia , Panz@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ie , peri@@ pher@@ al Neurop@@ ath@@ ie and P@@ ank@@ re@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of over@@ dose occurred at a 5 month old mini@@ dd@@ ler with a acci@@ dental loss of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate that showed up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ is@@ ular neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ aboli@@ zed active connection that caused by Ac@@ et@@ y@@ ulation with gl@@ ut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine that will be sign@@ posted via the kid@@ neys .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ omet@@ rical saw Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ ut@@ amine with urea comparable ( both connections contain 2 nit@@ rogen @-@ gl@@ ut@@ amine ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers for the sec@@ re@@ tion of surplus nit@@ rogen .
&quot; 5 patients with dist@@ urbances of the ur@@ inary cycle may be assumed that for each gram is recorded between 0,12 and 0,15 g Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine @-@ nit@@ rogen . &quot;
&quot; it is of significance that the diagnosis is early , and the treatment started immediately to improve the survival chances and the clinical result . &quot;
the pro@@ gn@@ osis of the early manip@@ ulated form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in the new@@ born age was almost always inf@@ ant and the disease led even in treating ob@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids from the first life of life to death .
&quot; by Hem@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative path@@ ways of nit@@ rogen @-@ clean@@ ers , so@@ dium @-@ fer@@ rous and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate new@@ born on post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first life @-@ month ) diagnostic diseases on 80 % . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy , and have been treated before the first appearance of hyper@@ tension en@@ cep@@ encephal@@ opathy , was the survival rate 100 % , but even in these patients it came with time with many for mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical de@@ fic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in patients with late manip@@ ulated form of the disease ( including feminine patients with het@@ ero@@ bic en@@ ran@@ sc@@ arb@@ ol@@ yl@@ ase @-@ Man@@ gels ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ tension en@@ vis@@ but@@ yr@@ at and then permanently with so@@ dium she@@ et@@ but@@ yr@@ at and a prot@@ ect@@ reduced diet , was the survival rate 98 % . &quot;
existing neuro@@ logical de@@ fic@@ its are also little reversible and in some patients may occur another deteri@@ oration of neuro@@ logical jurisdiction .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate oxi@@ di@@ zed , which is con@@ stru@@ ed in liver and kid@@ ney enz@@ ym@@ atic with gl@@ ut@@ amine , with Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine . &quot;
the concent@@ rations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and his met@@ abo@@ lic osis in plas@@ ma and ur@@ ine were obtained after Gab@@ an of a single dose of 5 g so@@ dium @-@ fer@@ yl but@@ yr@@ at for single use as well as repeti@@ tive Gab@@ en of or@@ mal dos@@ es of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled studies ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and his met@@ abo@@ lic were also investig@@ ated with cancer types of so@@ dium @-@ fer@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after a oral single dose of 5 g so@@ dium @-@ but@@ yr@@ at in tobacco form 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plas@@ mac@@ on@@ concent@@ rations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cir@@ c@@ ations or hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) the next morning after @-@ up fir@@ es no phen@@ yl@@ ates in the plas@@ ma .
&quot; with three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeated with so@@ dium @-@ kran@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three single parts ) , the middle of phen@@ yl@@ oc@@ at@@ ec@@ ul@@ ations on the third day five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
sec@@ re@@ tion The medication is made within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the jug@@ ular product Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ ut@@ amine over the kid@@ neys sign@@ posted .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests had copper @-@ so@@ dium @-@ but@@ yr@@ at with tox@@ ic and not tox@@ ic dos@@ es covered rats ( investigation 24 and 48 h after or@@ ous administration of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
&quot; AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS Gran@@ ul@@ at is taken either oral ( inf@@ ants and children , who are not able to swal@@ low tablets ) or on a neuro@@ logi@@ um or a Nas@@ en@@ son@@ de . &quot;
&quot; after the previous clinical experience is the normal daily dose of so@@ dium gly@@ co@@ lic at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day at new@@ born , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight above 20 kg as well as with her@@ ent and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammonia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ded amino acids ) , Car@@ ni@@ tin and Ser@@ um prot@@ ein in Plas@@ ma should be held within the Nor@@ mal@@ en@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in patients , who suffer from an early fixed lack of carb@@ am@@ yl@@ phosp@@ hate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ sc@@ arb@@ am@@ yl@@ ase , is the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ lin or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0,@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day required . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS Gran@@ ul@@ at contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per gram so@@ dium gly@@ c@@ rate , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium , which is equivalent to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; if R@@ atten@@ f@@ utes had been susp@@ ended in front of the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active met@@ abo@@ lit by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , it came to l@@ esi@@ ons in the pyr@@ ami@@ ds of the brain . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able tox@@ ic reaction to AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported from a 18 year old an@@ or@@ ec@@ tic patient , which developed a met@@ abo@@ lic encephal@@ opathy in conjunction with Lak@@ tat@@ azi@@ qu@@ ia , Panz@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ie , peri@@ pher@@ al Neurop@@ ath@@ ie and P@@ ank@@ re@@ atitis . &quot;

&quot; based on investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle can be adopted , that for each gram can be produced between 0.12 and 0.@@ 15 g Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; already existing neuro@@ logical de@@ fic@@ its are also little reversible , and in some patients may occur another deteri@@ oration of neuro@@ logical jurisdiction . &quot;
according to a oral individual dose of 5 g so@@ dium @-@ but@@ yr@@ at in Gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form have been found 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plas@@ mac@@ on@@ concent@@ rations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
&quot; during the duration of durability , the patient can store the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C . &quot;
&quot; with this procedure , the small exhibition sp@@ oon contains 0.@@ 95 g , the average measuring sp@@ oon 2,@@ 9 g , and the large measuring sp@@ oon 8,@@ 6 g so@@ dium . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to get the medication over a probe , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS can also be dis@@ solved in water ( the solv@@ ent of so@@ dium @-@ fer@@ but@@ yr@@ at is up to 5 g in 10 ml water ) . &quot;

&quot; Angi@@ ox will be used to treat adult patients with &quot; &quot; lo@@ ons cor@@ on@@ eness &quot; ( ACS , decre@@ ased blood flow towards the heart ) , for example , in inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest ) or M@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ inf@@ arkt ( heart attack ) without &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ ung &quot; ( an an@@ om@@ al measuring value at electro@@ cardi@@ olog@@ ram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
will Angi@@ ox to prevent blood c@@ ages in patients applied to a PCI will take a higher dose and in@@ fusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure .
this can contribute to patients with anxiety or heart fall to the maintenance of blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; nearly 14 000 patients participated in the capit@@ als of the treatment of ACS at all the treatment of an@@ gi@@ ox , with the effect of an@@ gi@@ rot@@ an @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another medicine to prevent blood pressure ) and a GP@@ I was compared to a gly@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an ) and a GP@@ I . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI the patient was often a St@@ ent ( a short tube , which began to prevent a cl@@ asp ) and they were additionally given other medicines to prevent blood c@@ ages , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; when the treatment of ACS was Angi@@ ox - with or without gifts of GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( death@@ s , heart inci@@ dents , or tur@@ as@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation ) after 30 days or a year are as effective as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who subj@@ ected to a PCI it was an@@ ox in terms of all indicators just as effective as Hep@@ arin , except heavy blood vessels when it was significantly more effective than Hep@@ arin . &quot;
Angi@@ ox must not be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergi@@ c ) against bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , other hi@@ ru@@ dine or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; it may not be applied in patients that recently had a blood @-@ blood , as well as with people with rigid hyper@@ tension or serious kid@@ ney problems or a heart infection . &quot;
the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ nei@@ x ( CH@@ MP ) wrote to the conclusion that Angi@@ ox in the treatment of ACS and during an PCI is a convenience replacement for hep@@ arin .
September 2004 the European Commission commissioned the Company The Medi@@ c@@ ines Company UK Ltd .
for the treatment of adult patients with ak@@ utes cor@@ on@@ ar@@ tis@@ men ( inst@@ abil@@ e Ang@@ ina / non @-@ sl@@ ist attack . ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) at a emergency access or when an early intervention is planned .
the recommended Initi@@ atives osis of Angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intra@@ ven@@ ous bolt from 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if the patient is carried out a PCI card , an additional bolt from 0,5 mg / kg and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention on 1,@@ 75 mg / kg / h increases . &quot;
after the PCI can re@@ produce the reduced In@@ fu@@ sion@@ sd@@ osis from 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours .
&quot; immediately before the procedure is to be administ@@ ered a bol@@ us@@ ement of 0,5 mg / kg , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1,@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the Rhin@@ oplast@@ y . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dosage of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with an PCI consists of a initi@@ als from 0,@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and an in@@ accurate in@@ fusion with a dose of 1,@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery . &quot;
the security and effectiveness of a sole bolt for@@ cri@@ e of Angi@@ ox was not investig@@ ated and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
&quot; this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) can be short@@ ened under 225 seconds , should be a second bol@@ tion of 0,@@ 3 mg / kg / body weight . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the appearance lower ACT values , the constitu@@ tive and dil@@ uted medicines before the application carefully mixed and the Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis can be administ@@ ered rapidly . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT Value is more than 225 seconds , another surveillance is no longer required , which is 1,@@ 75 mg / kg In@@ fu@@ sion@@ sd@@ osis will be correct . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a medium @-@ heavy kid@@ ney function ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , treated with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din against ACS or not ) , should be a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1,4 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; lies the ACT value below 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0,@@ 3 mg / kg to administ@@ er and the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis again . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a medium @-@ heavy nose , which resulted in the phase III I@@ - PCI @-@ study ( replace @-@ 2 ) that was the ACT value 5 minutes to Gab@@ e des Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without dosage adjustment on average 366 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 For patients with severe kid@@ ney treatment ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sec@@ ular patients is an@@ gi@@ ox cont@@ amin@@ ated ( see under Section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with an@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after ter@@ mination of the intra@@ ven@@ ous Gab@@ ions or 8 hours after the end of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous for@@ s of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous Hep@@ arin .
• Unknown hyper@@ sensitivity against the active ingredients or against Hi@@ ru@@ dine • active ble@@ eding or increased blood circulation system due to a disturb@@ ance of the her@@ mo@@ st@@ acy system and / or ir@@ reversible inhi@@ bit@@ al ble@@ eding . • severe un@@ locking d@@ us@@ ation ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients have been carefully super@@ vis@@ aged during treatment with regards to symptoms and signs of a blood flow especially if bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din can be administ@@ rated in combination with another anti@@ oc@@ ag@@ ul@@ an ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; even if with PCI @-@ patients under Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine most ble@@ eding points can occur in patients , which occur in a per@@ k@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) during treatment in principle . &quot;
&quot; in patients , the War@@ mar@@ in take part and treated with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , should make a surveillance of IN@@ R @-@ Wer@@ ts ( International norm@@ ative @-@ ratio Ratio ) , to ensure that the value is achieved before the treatment with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din back before the treatment existing level . &quot;
&quot; proce@@ eding from the knowledge of the working mechanism of anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ zi@@ en ( Hep@@ arin , War@@ mar@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tika or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ der@@ h@@ mer ) can be taken out of it that these agents will increase the blood circulation . &quot;
with the combination of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din with Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ sion@@ al numbers or anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ zi@@ en are the clinical and biological her@@ mo@@ st@@ acy parameters in any case regularly .

&quot; both in the be@@ vali@@ ru@@ din group as well as in the with hep@@ atitis , it joined women as well as patients over 65 years more frequently to adver@@ se events than with male or younger patients . &quot;
heavy ble@@ eding have been defined according to the Ac@@ uity and TI@@ MI sizes for heavy blood vessels as in the form of table 2 .
both light and heavy blood vessels performed less frequently than in the groups with hep@@ arin plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ prints plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( see chart 2 ) .
&quot; an Ac@@ uity heavy blood flow was defined as one of the following events : in@@ extraction , retro@@ sp@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ oc@@ ular blood flow of ≥ 3 g / dl without apparent blood flow , re@@ dem@@ ining of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bal blood flow , re@@ operation due to a blood flow , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion . &quot;

the following information about side effects are based on the data of a clinical study with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din at 6000 patients who under@@ goes to one PCI .
&quot; both in the be@@ vali@@ ru@@ din group as well as in the hep@@ at@@ arin manufacturing groups , it joined women as well as patients over 65 years more frequently to adver@@ se events than with male or younger patients . &quot;
both light and heavy blood vessels performed less frequently than in the compar@@ ative group under Hep@@ arin plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or .
&quot; the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported after comprehensive application in practice , and are arranged according to system design classes in chart 6 . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is immediately dism@@ is@@ sed and super@@ vis@@ e the patient with regard to signs of a ble@@ eding . &quot;
&quot; Angi@@ ox includes Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , a direct and specific Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in@@ ous inhi@@ bit@@ or , which is located both at the cat@@ aly@@ tic center as well as at the Ani@@ ol bind@@ ing@@ region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in bin@@ ds , regardless of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or at Ger@@ inn@@ sel . &quot;
&quot; the bond of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din at Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in turn out the bond of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ Ar@@ g@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly , making the function of the active center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in re@@ generated . &quot;

&quot; Ap@@ id@@ ra is used to treat adults , young people and children from six years with diabetes who need a treatment with insul@@ in . &quot;
Ap@@ id@@ ra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the ab@@ dom@@ inal wall , the thig@@ h or the upper arm inj@@ ected or as a continuous in@@ fusion with an in@@ sul@@ ph@@ um pump . &quot;
diabetes is an ail@@ ment in which the body is not enough in@@ timacy to control the glu@@ co@@ es@@ pi@@ eg@@ els ( sugar ) in the blood or the In@@ sul@@ in is not effective .
&quot; In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in is very slightly different from human insul@@ in , and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter efficiency cycle than a short @-@ effective human insul@@ in . &quot;
&quot; ap@@ id@@ ra was developed in combination with a slow insul@@ in in patients with type 1 diabetes , where the body can not produce any insul@@ in in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; in type 2 @-@ diabetes , where the body can not be eff@@ ected in in@@ effective , ap@@ id@@ ra was investig@@ ated in a study with 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main index@@ ator for the effectiveness was the change of concentration of the substance of the substance of the gly@@ cos@@ ity ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
&quot; in the first study with adults with type 1 @-@ diabetes , after six months a lower@@ ing of 0,@@ 14 % ( from 7,@@ 60 % to 7,@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0,@@ 14 % at In@@ sul@@ in@@ lis@@ per . &quot;
in adults with type 2 diabetes the lower@@ ing of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration 0.@@ 46 % after six months with ap@@ id@@ ra compared to 0.@@ 30 % for humanitarian Nor@@ mal@@ insul@@ in .
&quot; Ap@@ id@@ ra must not be used in patients that may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergi@@ c ) against In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or any of the other components , or in patients who already suffer from a hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emic . &quot;
the dos@@ es of Ap@@ id@@ ra may have to be adjusted when it is administ@@ ered along with a number of other medicines that can affect blood @-@ glu@@ co@@ asts .
September 2004 the European Commission commissioned the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ orio Germany GmbH is a permit for the establishment of Ap@@ id@@ ra in the entire European Union .
Ap@@ id@@ ra is known as sub@@ cut@@ aneous inj@@ tion either in the area of the ab@@ dom@@ ini@@ ums of the thig@@ hs or of the Del@@ t@@ am@@ usk@@ els or sub@@ cor@@ ding by continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the ab@@ dom@@ inal cord .
&quot; due to the decre@@ ased glu@@ co@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and the di@@ min@@ ated insul@@ in can be en@@ vis@@ aged in patients with a restriction of the liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of the efficiency , the brand ( her@@ - ) , the In@@ sul@@ ph@@ yp@@ s ( normal , n@@ ph , dri@@ ps , etc . ) , the type of insul@@ in ( animal insul@@ in ) and / or the manufacturer method can draw a change in the insul@@ in demand . &quot;
&quot; 3 An in@@ sufficient dosage or break@@ through treatment , especially in patients with a insul@@ in char@@ geable diabetes , can lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emic and a di@@ abe@@ tic K@@ eto@@ azi@@ cer . &quot;
&quot; the change@@ over of a patient at another In@@ sul@@ int@@ ype or an insul@@ in another manufacturer should be carried out under strict physician supervision , and can make a change of dosage . &quot;
the time of awakening of a hy@@ po@@ gly@@ c@@ emic depends on the working profile of the used In@@ sul@@ ine and can therefore change in the conversion of the treatment schem@@ as .
&quot; among the substances that can increase the blood decre@@ ases , an@@ ale anti@@ di@@ abe@@ tic , an@@ op@@ yr@@ amid , Fi@@ br@@ ate , Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ tin , Mon@@ o@@ amin @-@ oxid@@ id@@ ase ( Ma@@ o ) -@@ Hem@@ mer , Flu@@ ox@@ f@@ yll@@ in , Pro@@ po@@ x@@ yp@@ hs , S@@ aliz@@ yl@@ yp@@ hs , S@@ aliz@@ yl@@ yp@@ hs and Sul@@ fon@@ amid @-@ antibiot@@ ics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ oly@@ tika such as Bet@@ ab@@ lock@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ id@@ ine , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ ine and reserves the symptoms of ad@@ ren@@ water counter@@ regulation will be or lacking . &quot;
animal experim@@ ental studies show no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and Human@@ insul@@ in regarding pregnancy , the embry@@ onic development , the birth or the post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known as In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in into the human mother &apos;s milk , but generally occurs In@@ sul@@ in neither into the mother &apos;s milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ ated after or@@ ous application . &quot;

heavy hy@@ po@@ gly@@ c@@ als with awareness can be given by an in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ co@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) which is given by a doctor or by intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of glu@@ co@@ se by a doctor .
&quot; after a glu@@ co@@ agon@@ ary project , the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to identify the Ur@@ - and severe hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and avoid similar ep@@ isodes . &quot;
insul@@ in sen@@ kt the blood sugar levels through the stimulation of the peri@@ pher@@ al glu@@ co@@ up ( especially through sc@@ el@@ ett@@ mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as by the in@@ hibition of glu@@ co@@ production in the liver .

In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a twice as fast active efficiency than normal human insul@@ in and achiev@@ es complete glu@@ co@@ efficient effect about 2 hours earlier than human insul@@ in .
&quot; from the data was clear that at an application of In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal is reached a compar@@ ative post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ous gly@@ c@@ emic control , which is given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
