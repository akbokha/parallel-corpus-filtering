the package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; by using these easier available .
further information on the use of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in features can be found in the manual for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ;
&quot; to load these modules in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; to load settings extensions .... open the card menu tools and select the desired modules . &quot;
this is a list of standard blocks from the package ; add@@ ons . please note that any more modules on your system are installed if you have additional software installed .
you should install the package to install the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; if you compile this package .
&quot; to use the crash module , click in the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; on extras , you can view the page , the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; the list of abstr@@ acts , if available , delete . &quot;
the module An@@ sy@@ filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under extras . with the module you can filter &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current working directory in different ways .
&quot; to use the DO@@ M developer in the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or , select the DO@@ M tree ... and thus open a new window with the DO@@ M . as a default the display begins with the root notes of the document , example : next element , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this wor@@ m knot@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the module &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view for objects with the M@@ IME type ino@@ de / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different tool@@ bar and text views , to view the content of your local file system . &quot;
&quot; the speci@@ ality of &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; consists of the Ord@@ n@@ erh@@ arch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called tree @-@ map gra@@ ding . each object is propor@@ tion@@ ate to its size . this size must be proportional to its size . this size must be proportional to its size . this size must be propor@@ tion@@ ate to its size , that the sum of the sizes of the sub@@ ordin@@ ate object of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; at &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; reflects the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries can be defined in it . thus , the size of a folder can be easily recognized when they can be seen below in the folder hier@@ archy . therefore , &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; as a graphic and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; -@@ command you can be seen . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; an entry in the tre@@ k presentation represents a rect@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your file system . to simplify navigation , the right @-@ edge meaning@@ ful and lab@@ eling settings . &quot;
&quot; the colour of a rect@@ angle that is swit@@ ched over the color mode , can either be deep for the light detection of the nest@@ ing or the figure of another file name such as name , owner , group or m@@ ime @-@ type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be used with the different characteristics of the appropriate file or folder . for each property , you can define if it is shown at all , only if there is enough space to display or if the surface of sub@@ woofer can occur ) . in addition , you can define the relative position of the marking in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; at Dar@@ ling algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the area should not be respected for the size of the entry . at the stairs in &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; this target will not always be respected . please note that the sub@@ ordin@@ ate entries will no longer be available . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rect@@ angle is square . &quot;
&quot; as distribution of the area of an entry for the sub@@ ordin@@ ate entries , the implementation remains to be left . here it is intended for the lab@@ eling and avo@@ idance of rank@@ ings by frame always advant@@ age@@ ous the areas such . these are the best methods of this are lines , columns or recur@@ sive branch . &quot;
&quot; you can set the minimal booked surface for an entry on the menu entry . instead , a space pattern is drawn to the area of the higher @-@ level lecture , to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a sub@@ ordin@@ ate entry . &quot;
&quot; originally , &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets which was developed for use KC@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind . &quot;

&quot; a simple to use the camera site will provide you with your digital camera , and your photos directly in &amp; D . more than 1000 digital cameras will be supported by using the library of the library . of course , each medium and every card reader , which is supported by your operating system , with &amp; D . &quot;
&amp; D came ; incorpor@@ ates a fast image processing with basic training tools . you can use them to evaluate and correct your photos with KDE image plugins Interface ( manual ) modules are easily expanded .
&quot; although &amp; D came ; easy to use , it provides du@@ sting professional skills . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit Far@@ br@@ aum and all available modules support the raw converter by means of li@@ brown , DN@@ G export and IC@@ C @-@ color workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more met@@ ad@@ ata , such as &amp; eg ; about the camera or the lens , which can be sought . &quot;
&quot; as all &amp; k@@ de ; programs also &amp; D came ; an open source project . that means , it is dependent on the support of the end users . they should therefore report problems and improvement . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D came ; tried to make the mil@@ king of problems or suggestions for them . wherever you have entered in the program , the help menu contains an entry problems or wishes .... This opens a dialog with a under@@ lined link . all required information is listed here . follow the instructions to send your report . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D came ; is a project that is supported by a community . i.e. , the user and developers came to each other . if you have a regular user of &amp; D , then we would like to answer any questions of other users . in this mail@@ ing list , however , you may have questions to other users . in this mail@@ ing list , however , you should therefore be powerful , this language should therefore be powerful . &quot;
you can also visit the Q ; homepage to visit news about free versions and other information about &amp; D .
&quot; the best start to get involved in &amp; D , is the registration in the developer @-@ mail list . instructions to report in the developer @-@ mail list of &amp; D came ; &quot;
&quot; when you start &amp; D ; for the first time , you will be wonder@@ ing where you specify your pictures and your database . you can specify a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the folder icon to select a folder . &quot;
in the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here the data retri@@ eve is stored . this path will remain equal for all frames .
later you can add a lot of folders like you want to add . &amp; D came ; will be used in addition as Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek . settings / K@@ am setup Coll@@ ections .
&quot; if you have already a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder , the pictures illustr@@ ated as basic folder . no picture will be modified as an album . no picture will be changed . during the passage of the folder you will get a progress show like this : &quot;
&quot; &amp; D came ; allowed to recur@@ sively the bibli@@ othek@@ e@@ ad throughout all the depth . you can no sub@@ folders , unless it was in hidden folder . this allows you to insert a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as basic folder , you will notice that the albums in M@@ any Al@@ ben@@ ches have no photos than symbols . you can change it by selecting a favorite photo from the album and this will be used on the folder icon . further details can be found in the section albums . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the base folder , you can set in &amp; D ; your digital camera record . after that you should learn how you use My albums and My tab to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , so &amp; D entered . the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu Help raw cameras . &quot;
how to create this and with raw files is described in the sections of Ro@@ h @-@ De@@ co@@ der@@ settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
&quot; a simple to use the camera site will provide you with your digital camera , and your photos directly in &amp; D . more than 1000 digital cameras will be supported by using the library of the library . of course , each medium and every card reader , which is supported by your operating system , with &amp; D . &quot;
modern Dig@@ ital@@ k@@ amer@@ as are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) the camera will appear as a USB mass storage device . the camera will then be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its der@@ iv@@ atives . older cameras can also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; D came ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 for communication with digital cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is also supported the Picture Transfer Protocol , which has been developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transmission of pictures of digital cameras to b@@ ills and other peri@@ pher@@ als without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras will use the serial interface for their communication with the machine . as photos in general large files are slow and transfer through the serial port are slow , this connection is now out@@ dated . &amp; rade came , supports these cameras and conduc@@ ting the pictures with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link . &quot;
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support and therefore can be read by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 compan@@ ions . if the Exif support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the Exif support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the Exif support is not exist@@ ent in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the Exif support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the Exif support could not be read in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the Exif display may not be missed or the production could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things on &amp; D came ; is how easy to expand its functionality through modules :
K@@ IP@@ I Modul@@ es : the KDE image plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common modul@@ ation for &amp; D . the objective is to provide the modules with all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
&quot; modules can manip@@ ulate images in virtually any way , as well as a user can . your advantage is that it is much easier , &amp; D came ; by writing a small module to complement one function when changes in &amp; ordered ; even perform . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the page with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch in full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; drag and drop off images works anywhere : you can place an image in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ms , on the horizontal partition line or into another application window . the only restriction is not in terms of words , data sli@@ ste or sou@@ ps . &quot;
&quot; - a dat@@ yp@@ ical selection allows you to recover the most common : JPEG , PNG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio
the text filter is used only for the fields which are currently displayed in the tool@@ bar only when this ind it will appear . what fields can be displayed in the dialog of the alarm settings .
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; M@@ eine Al@@ ben@@ li@@ &apos; ; provides an organized view on your photo@@ cop@@ es . all photos that were saved by &amp; D . these albums are saved according to the folders , in which they have been created on the hard disk , according to the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ properties or after the date , where the album can be changed in the properties of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you have set a scanner , you can also add a photo directly into an album . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album . select the album Im@@ por@@ ters screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; to move a picture from one album to another one or move , you can select the photo using the mouse on the target album and drop it . you can move on the same way to move or copy it . simply select all the photos and move it to the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and album properties allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album properties , you need to click on the album and edit in the context menu Alb@@ um@@ properties . &quot;
&quot; Alb@@ um@@ - Coll@@ ections : are a method to highlight your albums , so that you can add a collection of your photos if you want to add new collections or remove albums . if you want to add new collections or delete them , you can make it in the settings for collections . &quot;
the Alb@@ um@@ - Date : will be used if you sort out your albums by date with view albums sort by date .
&quot; the buttons , average , latest : these put the date on the oldest , of the latest image or the passage of the album . it will first attempt to calculate the average of images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , instead the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; when you first got an album in &amp; D , the first image of the album viewed as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this will help you to see the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you must click on the image with the right mouse button and in context menu &amp; quot ; As Alb@@ um@@ vor@@ schau . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can only be included in a collection and collections can not be closed .
&amp; D came ; supported the input of stit@@ ches for individual photos in the area of My keyword list left in the main window . album Coll@@ ections have a different effect . the collection always belong to all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
&quot; the window window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all pictures in this album are displayed in the picture window . each photo will be shown in a preview , you can customize the size of this pre@@ ference with the two lou@@ d@@ speakers in the tool@@ bar . &quot;

&quot; you should be aware that it may not occur after processing through other image programmes . some programs can not store it with the image contained in the picture . some programs can save this data from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture etc. lost . &quot;
&amp; D came ; introduces two possibilities for rotation . the easi@@ est is to click on the preview and select Dre@@ w . in the sub @-@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
&quot; to change the filename of a photo , you can click with the right mouse button on the preview and select a ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you maintain the extension ( .jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; if you came a photo of &amp; Poker ; delete , it is del@@ ayed to the M@@ ül@@ mer of &amp; k@@ de ; post@@ pon@@ ed F@@ 8 image Del@@ ete or Ent@@ f Falls you prefer really del@@ e@@ tion , you can use this by adding Shift . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My dat@@ um@@ sli@@ ste@@ quot ; organized your photos from the data . &amp; D came ; used for either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last change in the file . &quot;
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all the photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the data sheet below , so that you can only show the photos of the selected days . &quot;
&quot; photos with keywords provided a flexible and powerful way to organize your photos and cat@@ alogues . tags are stick@@ ers , the individual pictures or whole groups can be assigned . once a keyword can be assigned to a photo by selecting this sample or a search . &quot;
&quot; if a keyword is selected , all the photos marked with this keyword , displayed . &quot;

&quot; &amp; D came ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorith@@ m . this allows you to compare to these sig@@ natur@@ es . the lower the difference between two images , the more comply with them . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area where you can fall to each picture . by means of a sw@@ elling , the result is enlarged or decre@@ ased by clicking on the icon of in@@ lay search in the left page row , then it will open and you can fall there . &quot;
sk@@ etch : open @-@ color sk@@ etch : draw a fast sk@@ etch and &amp; D ; find the matching images . also here can be a sw@@ elling .
&quot; this rider provides an intuitive approach based on the Mar@@ ble mini programme . you can move using the mouse wheel or th@@ omas . click C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to pull out a square . all images within these coordinates are filter@@ ed and displayed . this is of course ahead that your pictures will contain ge@@ o data . &quot;
&quot; in the field below you can specify a name for your Ge@@ o filters . this will then be added for a later use of the list below . he works like a live geo@@ ord@@ ner . &quot;
&amp; D came ; introduces a lumin@@ ous table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . he works with all supported image formats , also raw files . &quot;
&quot; select one or more images from any view in the main window , and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L D@@ em bul@@ b are added from the context menu . the selection will be added to the lumin@@ ous and its window . if you are back in &amp; D ; main window , you can open the lumin@@ ance fast with L extras . &quot;
&quot; from the preview bar you can compare the images you want to see in the left or right area of the window , and put there . a small arrow shows you to which copy out of the tool@@ bar , select and Zoo or shift oper@@ ations on one of the images , then they will be compared with the other image , then they can compare the same area of both images . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to view quickly from a picture series , then the two first pictures are automatically loaded into the areas to the same image . the right Ad@@ ded picture is shown in the right section . this simpli@@ fies it through a number of similar pictures . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal wages also work directly from the light@@ table like F@@ 4 file Edit ... &quot;
&quot; all images from the right side bar of the main window are available for both pro@@ spect@@ acle in the lumin@@ aire . this makes it e.g. simply visual differences with exposure data . &quot;
&quot; in the lower end of each area you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function , you need to detect the visible paths . in order to check the visible field of the picture , you need to check this click and the &amp; L@@ MB ; pressed onto the same image , both images will show the same image area . &quot;
the zo@@ oming works as well as in other opinions . simply use the zoom control among the pictures or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to enter into the picture and out to zo@@ oming . this happens in both pictures if you are in the mode preview .
&quot; what is a digital survey management - away from the Mo@@ de@@ word - digital survey , each part of the process is followed by the final output and permanent storage . each of the photos records , sc@@ ans or digital photos records a form of digital survey . &quot; most of us do this , but not in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool to secure a plan and practical tips on how to secure your pictures , protect and use photos . so we look at the procedures for digital phot@@ ogra@@ fen the &amp; D . we look forward to the procedure for digital photography . we look forward to secure , secure , evaluate , evaluate , waiting , wait and export of images files . &quot;
&quot; digital survey takes on , index@@ ed , categorized , sec@@ ures , sec@@ ures , transform@@ ing , assembled , con@@ fin@@ alized , and exported content that creates a mon@@ ary or cultural value . &quot;
&quot; met@@ ad@@ ata are defined as data on data . met@@ ad@@ ata are defined in accordance with your definition of data , information on or documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment . &quot;
&quot; I d@@ are to maintain , if you need more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you need not even know how many photos you don &apos;t even know how many photos you don &apos;t have to know how many photos you don &apos;t have to store any specific sear@@ ches and a safe archiving on which you can access with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first what you do and need to know before you have to maintain the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . you need to decide whether to have access to your photos , whether you want to have access to your photos , or on a network drive &amp; etc ; take that you have to switch to a larger drive at some time . &quot;
&quot; maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly through your location . if you organize enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . then export is a folder for images you print or on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have different requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing of photos , archiving , work processes , consistent audi@@ ences of images to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years are 95 % archives and 5 % working files , and you will not want to organize your structure for this content . &quot;
which types of files are fit together ? the separation of file types makes the st@@ acking processing easier . separate new of old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are searching for an original or a derived image .
&quot; we also recommend the option met@@ ad@@ ata in the Settings page of the met@@ ad@@ ata in &amp; D . this provides certain that Ex@@ if@@ - and IP@@ TC data will be written in the file , then you can save the met@@ ad@@ ata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate item in the menu Album . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what if you want to change ? this presents a met@@ ad@@ ata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones . &quot;
&quot; now the real work , since you should choose any photo words , lab@@ eling and a review . of course , you can choose the same attributes , and then put the value then . you start best with the rating or the leader@@ board . this makes sense , since you can concentrate on the best photos at the best photos . &quot;
&quot; let us now let us with keywords , keywords , as you are frequently called for other programs or categories . all three are syn@@ onymous for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; when you import cat@@ alog@@ ed images from another source with built @-@ in terms , then &amp; D entered into the right place . the um@@ sort of the Hier@@ archy inside the tree is not a problem and can simply be done by the pull of a sub @-@ tree on another . the amended keywords are track@@ ed by &amp; D ; updated during it the under@@ trees were pursued . &quot;
the graphic shows how different met@@ ad@@ ata is over@@ cut . this is a very cru@@ de representation since each block of met@@ ad@@ ata in truth consists of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and cal@@ ender data of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section relate to lab@@ eling or comments to harmon@@ ise the third important tool for your met@@ ad@@ ata .
&quot; you want to just let your photos just watch , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . they are sure to be interested in your photos . &quot;
&quot; take a look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you see it closer , then start to see some details , fol@@ ks , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I say to you that of the Lan@@ de@@ platz of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French mand@@ y 60 years after the land@@ ing is . Wow ! it starts to dream , associates , the historical time span is back again , you might even listen to the silence . the lab@@ eling has completely changed your perception of this panorama . &quot;
&quot; for others who consider the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should show a story , to help Him over the mot@@ if you moved to what you understand what you understand . &quot;
it &apos;s OK when an image is not perfect when it comes the strength only with a let@@ ter@@ ing for itself alone .
&quot; with &amp; D ; you can export as a lot of text , in an international alphab@@ et ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , then you can even use it for a selection of pictures at the same time . KDE provides you a spell check for a selection of pictures at the same time . &quot;
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find into another city without navigation system ? was it Earth not a boring planet before G@@ oogle@@ Earth ? well because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now already with light speed .
&quot; the possibilities for Ge@@ ol@@ ocation are already in@@ separ@@ ably and are able to open up in the future , you can repeat your travel , in the near future , you can also post k@@ ml files . this then shows the pictures at G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flick@@ r &amp; etc ; with the G@@ oogle@@ Maps @-@ viewer . &quot;
&quot; the copy@@ left is a word play with copyright and describes the terms of copyright laws to remove constra@@ ints on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms are also considered in all amended versions , so also for the work of others . &quot;
the following description tells you what information is available in the set @-@ up page of &amp; D ; as a information you should be depos@@ ited :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym@@ ously for adults and authors ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who has created the photo to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a firm or organization should not be changed . this field does not support nor sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym@@ ously for reference line ) : associated with the author . examples of this field contains the work of the photographer . examples for this can be title as : Employee photographer , freelance photographer or independ@@ ant photographer . since this is a note to the author &apos;s author , it must be filled this as well . &quot;
&quot; ( syn@@ onym@@ ously for providers ) : use the vend@@ er@@ field to identify who it . this must not be listed here . if the photographer can be listed here . if the photo is listed here , then the group / Agentur is listed here . if the image is a stock photo , then the group / Agentur is specified here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this no protection against abuse can offer them , delete or change . the solution for this problem is digital water@@ mark . for individuals , this protection is only very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and half @-@ professionals , this protection is very important for it . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; D came in the near future to provide such a module for the for@@ kli@@ ft processing .
&quot; topics : sheet metal , turn@@ outs , black@@ boards , ECC , over@@ load , recovery , red@@ und@@ ancy , dis@@ ast@@ ance , back@@ time , temperature , data size , widespread super@@ sti@@ tions &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that may have lost on the road or a fire . these kinds of loss may also happen to you with traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . this section is about problems in the so called new media . &quot;
&quot; roll On@@ track , the biggest data collection of the world , has some interesting statistics which has a data loss . &quot;
&quot; to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs must be treated these prec@@ ari@@ ous quality and you may not stay longer than a couple of years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archi@@ ved quality . there are offers about Gold coated DVDs , &amp; Dollar ; 2 the piece that is a life time of 100 years for themselves . whether you believe that is in your discretion . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD discs can be un@@ read@@ able , but you can use this risk in which you can use good discs and good recording sessions . the best DVD recording devices are not much more reliable than the cheap , but you write a lot of reliable . it is therefore the right to choose the right . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to errors , even if you just have written a check@@ sum@@ ation mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we needed for the form@@ atting and the control environment . despite this massive protection , they need for the form@@ atting and the control environment , in spite of this massive ag@@ eing , Ultra@@ Light Light , Kr@@ atz@@ er , Stau@@ b &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs there is a cheap program called I@@ so@@ Bust@@ er that appears to be done with CDs and DVDs . it works on Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is also not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications the cor@@ rupted data from damaged disks , hard drives , Flash@@ ing , USB drives , etc . &quot;
optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to win the formats against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six@@ teen the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8,5 GB . everything about CDs and DVDs was said of course also for the Blu @-@ ray disc .
&quot; then burn slowly with a good recording of high quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ etary format . read afterwards the media with a description , date &amp; author marks and afterwards on a clean , dark dry spot and above animals protected town . do not forget to read the data on the next generation of media or software that can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media . &quot;
Disk@@ manufacturer reserve your statistics for yourself . your production facilities include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study about the error mechanisms of hard drives : flo@@ ppy disk . &quot;
&quot; shortly : Dis@@ ks will keep on the lon@@ gest . if you are operated in the temper@@ ament range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C . at lower temper@@ ament , the most common error message , SMAR@@ T can not determine this mistakes . some of SMAR@@ T is determined the most common fail@@ ures . this is a expected life time between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; this is only the complete set due to over@@ tension . of course , you can also loss data loss due to an power loss before you have secured files , but these losses usually can be restored without major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electrical equipment stream does not make a lot to do that in devices with a computer chips and high @-@ speed processes , these an@@ om@@ ali@@ es coll@@ ects these an@@ om@@ ali@@ es key@@ boards , complete data loss , hard@@ ware@@ mother@@ boards and other def@@ ective tissues which leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; the most widespread protection against power levels is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bed a part of energy supply and the rest . it is usually available in the form of a so@@ ckets . &quot;
&quot; if you &apos;re looking for an over@@ eating protection , then you should pay attention to the UL 1449 standard . this guarantees a specific minimum of protection . you should also consider that he protects the protection against flash accounts and therefore protects the properly connected devices . &quot;
&quot; because an over@@ voltage can use every cable to your computer , you should consider that also all peri@@ pher@@ als can be connected to your system . some manufacturers provide a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ ax@@ ial cable and the television card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , then you will need a portable Over@@ voltage protection . a large number of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks and therefore also contain the protection for the modem . thus you are ideal for on the go . &quot;
during an over@@ time protection of your system before smaller spon@@ ge in the power lines will not really help you . even an inci@@ dent of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a under@@ break@@ able power supply .
&quot; in addition to the protection against sur@@ ge@@ ars can provide these devices automatically cor@@ dless energy , if a power supply you can continue to store up to the current again . if you need a US@@ V running . in addition , you should be sure that they perform the same quality standards like a hand@@ craft@@ sman protection . in addition , the life @-@ time of the battery and the attached software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; the potential risk that you are exposed to your b@@ illing system and compare its safety at electricity dis@@ infection with the costs for avo@@ idance of this . a high quality hand@@ voltage pressure you can get up to &amp; euro ; 20 , A 500@@ w US@@ V can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 20 . this is just a small price . at the end , you should always think all the cable before you go into the holidays . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web Service includes S3 - Sim@@ ple Storage Service - a simple memory service . with the right configuration you can use this as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows user . this allows you to use this as a backup job for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any quantities of data . &quot;
&quot; they are very expensive compared to the hard drives , however very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; Dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost @-@ Dollar ; 500 . in addition , you must send the data about the compar@@ atively slow Internet . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the solutions are therefore suitable only as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . it is too slow . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flick@@ r ( Yahoo ) , Flick@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo @-@ community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com are available for photos . your free memory is available on 1 GB . the professional version will not be available in full resolution online . for 25 $ a year you will receive unlimited memory that should be checked in reality . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data protection are the web solutions very secure . transmission errors are automatically set @-@ up , and with the large companies included in the offer a backup and a distributed memory . this makes them des@@ ast@@ er@@ able . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all transfers are sus@@ cep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs are at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
&quot; the worst thing about it is that you nobody occurred when a transmission error occurred , not if this is destroyed during your hardware . it is quite disturb@@ ing that it is in your machine . no one seems to have no protection to it . no one seems to have thought it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data way than that in your computer . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable power parts are another source of transmission rate , since they generate interference within the data flows . in normal file systems these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are currently not particularly affected by brid@@ ging problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year . &quot;
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems appears to be one of two candidates and can be able to deal with sheet errors on low level and is available under a GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is soon available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows available . read this article in english .
oracle has started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still used in alpha status . it uses the same protective mechanism the Z@@ FS and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
&quot; do not appreciate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in not@@ ebook , and 46 % in the workplace systems . if Not@@ ebooks is already the part of the theft of the theft . &quot;
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than the Mei@@ ists . it leads to a lower damage than e.g. theft , or rest@@ install@@ ations . and it is currently only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; for a long time no longer has been health@@ i@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss as propri@@ etary systems : wrong , N@@ TFS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and XF@@ S to name the widespread fil@@ esyst@@ ems . a very good english article can be found here . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent cor@@ rupt data and data loss : incorrect , only the speed of the investig@@ ating process during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status will be prevented before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : false , theft and human error are the main interests of data loss . &quot;
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 blocks from fundamental physical boundaries . it is that while the technology is further developed there is a natural fron@@ tier for this progress . Sensitivity and pre@@ characteristic for all types of light sensors are no longer distant from this border .
today cameras go towards the 10 Meg@@ api@@ x@@ el@@ sens@@ oren too . even though this dis@@ solution is more deteri@@ or@@ ated for compact cameras and high quality optics are the optim@@ um for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have your border with 10 @-@ 12 Meg@@ api@@ xel . for higher resolution you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24x@@ 36@@ mm ) or bigger formats .
&quot; a 750@@ GB hard disk will get you today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not get any other responsible for data transfer . 6 % of all PCs are affected by a plan and test this backup before you make something vulnerable as the re@@ install of your operating system , the exchange of plates or the biggest modification of hard disks . &quot;
&quot; supp@@ ose you make every day your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a bl@@ itz , you are lucky when the drive was not connected to the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster propos@@ es locally and destroyed a lot . forget aircraft pieces : fire , water , electricity , children and theft for your data are dangerous enough . they usually concern a whole room or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Des@@ ast@@ er@@ prevention always means a local storage , always bring your f@@ uses the stairs into the neighboring house , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as above mentioned is a common reason for a data loss , despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save it one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all the files are to be backed up . it is a snapshot of without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differenti@@ ation : a backup of the files have been changed since the last complete assurance . creates a complete snapshot of two times : the complete assurance and the last difference .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files have been changed since the last backup . this backup comes back at the original status at any time . this backup comes to a ver@@ sion@@ ing system the next one with the exception that it is only temporary and not ongoing .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer@@ ring tran@@ scripts only the difference of files that were really changed . this is com@@ pressed and if you want to increase security over ss@@ h .
backup important pictures directly after you save it on your computer to a DVD or other optical medium .
&quot; this course leaves you enough time to discover losses and restore again . at the same time you come up for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the work@@ book . at the end , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot should be manually done after which you have made a complete review . &quot;
&quot; themes : met@@ ad@@ ata , in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , repeti@@ tion of images and met@@ ad@@ ata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , visibility , ... , use of the internet . &quot;
&quot; that valuable images will survive the next 40 year , that is about the time period in which you really want to remember you because they should remember your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be observed : &quot;
since the future due to your nature is un@@ predic@@ table you need to consider everything today . unfortunately there is no other option than a certain vig@@ il@@ ance to release . unfortunately there are no other option to be compatible with caution . all 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself as the current system is re@@ wards so easy to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered with the explanations in this document . use and switch to open standards that are supported by many applications .
&quot; Virtu@@ alization is now available for everyone . if you have an old system , then store it on and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and securing technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the expert pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size . this means actually always enlarge .
let &apos;s go out that you have planned a scal@@ ability with one planned and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated record or partition . at * nix Systems as &amp; Linux ; can copy this area and shift on a new record :
&quot; check with the command d@@ mes@@ g , whether your new record has been recognized by the system , but do not hang it . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Dollar ; dd if = / dev / sd@@ c # Source is / dev / sd@@ c , the new record / sd@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the plate in MB@@ s ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , fat@@ 16 , 32 and Reiser@@ FS &amp; Dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of Reiser@@ FS if necessary &quot;
&quot; open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software can read more , then you can create it . this task will become easier from year to year . &quot;
GI@@ F is a propriet@@ ory , pat@@ ented format that dis@@ appears from the market . they should no longer use it . &quot;
&quot; PNG was replaced as an open source standard , it can replace X@@ MP , ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ ad@@ ata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . PNG possible Gam@@ ma@@ - and chrom@@ ati@@ ity data for a improved color assignment in het@@ ero@@ gene@@ ous platforms , but not as many as TI@@ FF and a slow com@@ pression . this format we would like to recommend you to save your pictures . &quot;
TI@@ FF was widely used as a photo format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ com@@ pressed form or in a container with a ver@@ lu@@ st@@ free com@@ pres@@ sion@@ sal@@ ation@@ ism ( DE@@ FL@@ ATE ) . it is managed to store images in this format . a problem is however more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DN@@ G The Digit@@ ale Neg@@ ative file format is a licensed and open raw format that developed by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G has been developed on the TI@@ FF / EP Format and comm@@ its for the use of met@@ ad@@ ata . a hand@@ ful of camera is now available and we hope that the competit@@ or Canon and Nikon it is also some@@ time .
&quot; this is possibly one of the reasons why to replace 2001 , Adobe its XML based X@@ MP technology , in order to replace the &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ forms ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers draw it from an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format , as it saves the met@@ ad@@ ata separately from the image file . it can only be used to problems in the link between the Metad@@ at@@ end@@ at@@ ei and image file . therefore , you should think about whether you use DN@@ G as a container and put everything there . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online Metad@@ at@@ and@@ ards , which includes a large range of applications and business models , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and clari@@ fication efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of met@@ ad@@ ata ards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import images from the camera , the Card@@ reader or the scanner . so long the pictures on the camera , you can use this as temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to DN@@ G and save it in your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
&quot; for an enemy @-@ free processing , you can use external programs . if you edit the pictures again with &amp; Send ; then you should edit the met@@ ad@@ ata again . these were cut by the other programs under circumstances . &quot;
&quot; use the edited images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . then export it in MPEG , use in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; D . in the section Add pictures to an album , you can already add a description as you can already add on your hard disk . however , the camera interface makes you a lot of advanced settings to im@@ print from pictures to your Alb@@ um@@ at@@ enb@@ ank . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; D , connect them to the computer to turn the camera to the scor@@ er dus to turn and switch it . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect with your camera . if the connection is made . some cameras do not appear at the bottom and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will display . some cameras do not display a look @-@ image for each file , photos , movies , music etc. on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information to any entry . with the page properties and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of a entry or its met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; this dialog shows file characteristics and the photo information to be stored intern@@ ally from the camera . a symbol indicates that the picture has not been downloaded to your computer . note that with some Dig@@ ital@@ k@@ amer@@ as does not require any information available . &quot;
the tab met@@ ad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ ad@@ ata such as Exif display , GPS etc. the image . this information is the same as in the met@@ ad@@ ata page row from the main window of &amp; D ; or the image processing . note that these met@@ ad@@ ata are not available at some Dig@@ ital@@ k@@ amer@@ as . &quot;
the easi@@ est way to download photos on their computer is the click on the button to download and then download the selection of all . this loads the photos from their camera into one single album in &amp; D . by downloading the photos can be downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
&quot; if you do not want to download all the photos , you can only choose the desired with the default methods of &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the button to download and then download then selected . the button check out is as long as you selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera is supported , an option is new to download . these pictures have been downloaded by &amp; D . in this case the new images marked with a star in the window . if you choose this option , of course only the new pictures are downloaded . &quot;
&quot; when you download the buttons All or use them , appears a dialog with which you can select the target album , displayed like normal folder , displayed like normal folder . select the target album out of the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after that you have chosen the target album , press OK , and &amp; D . loads the photos from the camera into the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all of them at once , by clicking the button Del@@ ete . if you only need to delete them , then you have to delete it and delete deleted remove . &quot;
&quot; note that there are no possibility to restore you from the camera , deleted . they should not be deleted if you delete them from the camera . if you want to delete them from the camera . if you want to delete them from camera , since this is much faster now . &quot;
cameras do not use as a fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos frequently not particularly meaning@@ ful names . this can usually be cancelled after the photos from the camera . therefore it can be useful to integrate the date and time when the image was taken into the file name in the file name .
&quot; in the next section you will find options for turning and mirr@@ ors of the image and for dat@@ al@@ based under@@ carriage . if you use this latter option , automatically a folder is created per day . &quot;
the options D@@ uring the transmission opens three more options that are performed before the photographs are stored on the record . the first two concern the data on the author in the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct the date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures .
&quot; if you desire another data format than the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . for further adjustments you should read the help of the command Read more . &quot;
&quot; if you use the camera file name , you have the option to change the filename in lower@@ case . or in big letters , if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new filename , the &amp; D entered ; for a photo is used to display the camera in the preview . your settings to ren@@ ame are stored and automatically used if you open the next time the camera window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D came ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera to time , to perform an automatic rotation during the shut@@ down . not all cameras make this information available . in the section si@@ deb@@ ata , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; the automatic rotation is usually enabled , and when your camera does not supply this information ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to switch the automatic rotation , use the button expand@@ able and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; when your camera was made available through the date , where the photo was made available to download the photo album . all pictures with the same date are loaded into the same track . not all cameras make this information available . in the section page row Meta data , you can read what information your camera could be embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is normally off , and in this case saves &amp; D came ; the photos directly on the target album . if you want to change this option , you need to switch this option . use the button @-@ based under@@ carriage at the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; the easi@@ est way to load photos of their computer to load their camera is the button . select the file sel@@ ector &amp; k@@ de ; appears in which you can choose the files you want to select . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods . &quot;
&quot; after the choice is asked , asks &amp; D came ; you where the pictures will be loaded high . select a folder in dialog for the camera . select the folder you want to start . the pictures will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this is a position to be displayed in long@@ itude and lati@@ tude , and which can be shown on a map , the identification of the data can be performed by the American GL@@ ON@@ AS , the European Galil@@ eo or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers can link it interesting to link a picture with a con@@ cis@@ e geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to collabor@@ ate an area through automatic recording of GPS data . environment planners , military , architecture , architecture and real estate mac@@ ro can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten later that exactly the photo was made , you can simply send a postcard to another &amp; D . users want to change the location of the photos , or just want to document this aspect , it &apos;s well informed the position data of a photos . &quot;
&quot; the question is how come the GPS data in the image ? first , you should know that exi@@ v@@ 2 many GPS data fields , such as the direction , Sadd@@ les and Card@@ references . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the correct hardware , about a post @-@ processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module to the geographical assignment ( manual ) and most recently the manual entry of known places . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there are currently no camera integrated with GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS receiver . either as a card module or via transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ote@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q i@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR RI@@ CO@@ H Pro G@@ 3 Sony
&quot; downloading data from one device can be done with gp@@ sman or gp@@ sb@@ abel . you need to store these data in gp@@ x format , as this is the only format that is supported by the module for geographical assignment . &quot;
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract the data from pictures and from GPS . on the following page you can make the same under &amp; Linux ; do : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itude and lati@@ tude or other data , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ if@@ Tool by Phil Harv@@ ey . it uses the pre @-@ mark coordinates , which will be created for example by map@@ s.@@ g@@ oogle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ g@@ oogle.com shows no European road cards . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;

&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright legal data . these data are automatically selected in the appropriate IP@@ TC data fields , even if the option is selected from the camera site . also with a database synchroni@@ zation , these data are written in the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; author Tit@@ le is a syn@@ onym for the editor : this field should contain the design@@ ation of the photographer . this can be design@@ ations such as registered photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a detailed description to the author , must this also be filled . &quot;
editors is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to use the photo . this must not be the author since these organizations should be listed here because these are the picture of other &amp; quot ; it should be included here . if the image is a stock photo then the group or agency should be available here .
&quot; the IP@@ TC promotions save the data in the appropriate IP@@ TC field . thus , the met@@ ad@@ ata are permanently included in the picture and are not only available in the database of &amp; D . these met@@ ad@@ ata are also available in other programs and can be import@@ ed in &amp; D . &quot;

&quot; the settings of the illumin@@ ance of &amp; D entered ; can be put on this page to the default values . each , however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode , then you can only use different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode . if you have one , then you can only get better results . &quot;

over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dar@@ ker or bright@@ er color in the picture . these colors will be specified here . in image processing this an@@ picture can be swit@@ ched with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 and off .
with Chro@@ ma @-@ sub@@ sampling is meant that the images are coded into a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in color information . please read this article in Wikipedia about the next declaration .
&quot; with the setting PNG com@@ pression , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality , since PNG requires a loss@@ less algorith@@ m . if you have a fast computer , you can put this value on a high com@@ pression . thus , 1 : a low and 9 a high com@@ pression . &quot;
with the TI@@ FF files you can com@@ press the DE@@ FL@@ ATE -@@ Com@@ pres@@ sion@@ sal@@ ic for TI@@ FF pictures . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . it has no influence on image quality since the DE@@ FL@@ ATE -@@ algorith@@ m .
&quot; with the attitude of the JPEG JPEG @-@ 2000 files you can save it freely . even if you have written the loss setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size was written far better than in the normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , met@@ ad@@ ata was not yet supported , but there was in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in previous versions of &amp; D , the image processing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently , it develops very fast to a tool for manip@@ ulation of your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the standard delivery is that all green pixels are equal . if you use this problem with minimal loss in the output . if you use this option , remove this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option shows the picture a little soft , eliminate the 2x@@ 2 G@@ ad pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the whi@@ pped of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used if the White @-@ slip is not set . Standard is it a fixed colour balance , which was photograph@@ ed on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in the sun@@ light . &quot;
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SLR cameras . the use of the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps more details in the leaf@@ lets . for other cameras this option will be ignored .
&quot; the standard it is the most pointed , so the parts of your pictures have been printed because of the in@@ ability of your camera , the setting of your camera is created , as it shows the setting up in various ros@@ cop@@ es . finally , you can try some parts of missing information from the hard@@ ships . &quot;
this is possible because blue pixels in general is not as fast as green and red . &amp; D came ; and d@@ us@@ w try to re@@ constructed the missing green and red shares from the still non saturated blue pixels . of course this is a matter how much color or white you want .
&quot; when you select the option , you get the option to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adapted for each image individually . &quot;
put the L@@ umin@@ ance according to your taste . you will probably have to put it somewhat higher than the standard 1 . this can also be done later in the image options of &amp; D . to keep the time for dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should be conserv@@ ative . &quot;
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing -@@ algorith@@ m is a digital image process to expect a complete picture from the partial filter@@ ed image sensor that sets many cameras and the matrix colored pixels . this algorith@@ m is also known as CF@@ A @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
&amp; D came ; and D@@ cra@@ w introduced to you three alternatives : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( Vari@@ able number of Gra@@ di@@ alog@@ y ) was created as if A@@ HD @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was created as if A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variation number of gra@@ dient ) was also interesting when you search for a quick solution with a acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can set the rot@@ - and blue @-@ proof values here . this is certainly the best method for a color @-@ based correction , since you will be done during raw conversion . &quot;
a profile translated the color information and gives instructions how to be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; D entered ; information like the color information from a Far@@ br@@ aum in the other are to translate the colors as accurate as possible .
behaviour questions when a picture opens in image processing is opened / color administration module with raw files .

settings of the IC@@ C profiles you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ared ; for your profiles to be depos@@ ited . everything can be changed at the opening of the rough file later .
the colours site is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures colored not the entire screen .
&quot; the di@@ abe@@ tic profiles should be used to the camera profiles and model that you are using . not all profiles are contained in the same type . currently , correc@@ ted d@@ cra@@ w gam@@ ma do not contain conver@@ sions with 16 bit depth . this means that you have to perform the paint mapping itself . &quot;
&quot; there are other options like the Soft Pro@@ of profile , with which you can em@@ ulate how your printer can be added as your camera as your printer , and some colors can therefore be very saturated . this could you manually correct , instead of leaving for the blind algorith@@ m of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras it is quite obvious which colour profile is intended for them . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore , here a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is of course in@@ officially : &quot;
&quot; Canon Pro@@ extensions leaves the style for the target : F for an exact style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portra@@ it@@ and S for the standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image matters and images supported ; many modules have been supported , to work with each program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . choose which you want to use , and these modules are loaded as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition , you will find some also in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; short commands for tasks that are performed by modules , can be set in the menu under settings short . &quot;
further information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I @-@ Modul@@ es can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project at http : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ in@@ s.org or in the hand@@ books of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .

&quot; the camera properties show on the left a list of all the currently supported cameras . on the right side there is a button of automatic detection , which is trying to identify a camera connected to the computer . currently , the portal is properly connected , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire storage . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the end , you can put the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) , this field is only active if you choose a US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire button in the camera . you must specify here the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / both , specify on which you attach your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; D , you need to connect the camera with your computer to put it on display in the display area . &quot;
&quot; try whether &amp; D entered ; the camera automatically recognis@@ es . if not , you can set camera dell and Port manually . after you have set your camera , your camera will appear in the menu camera . &quot;
you can choose any name for your camera . this will be shown in the menu cameras of the main window . if you have more than one camera you can insert them here .
&quot; with the option of confirmation for the slide of &gt; pictures in the M@@ ül@@ mer , you can view the conversation of &amp; D ; when delet@@ ing a photos in one album . in the sections delet@@ ing a photos and delet@@ ing a album you will find further details . &quot;
&quot; the editorial changes through the right side bar can be used by &amp; D , if you use the option to apply changes in the right side bar without feed@@ backs . otherwise , you have to apply changes to the kno@@ b changes . &quot;
you can also tie the display of the welcome screen of &amp; D . this acceler@@ ates under the start @-@ up of &amp; D .
&quot; the setting to search for new photos , &amp; D came to search for new or deleted albums / photos . this is extended the starting time of &amp; D . this is extended the starting time of &amp; D . if something from the base sub@@ folder was deleted , asking if it was supposed to delete it from the database . &quot;
various colours can be used in &amp; D ; used to adjust the main window to suit your tastes . these settings can select you under settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs are listed below :
&quot; these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in simple text files , please find more information about it in this tutorial . &quot;
&amp; D came ; incorpor@@ ates a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and to the correction and improvement . image processing can be started by a click with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of the preview and selection of the advertisements / editing .
image processing contains a number of tools to improve your pictures . some of them are available as modules in &amp; D . they are under circumstances not part of your distribution . further information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found in the section image processing .
&quot; a status line at the bottom of the window , the filename , current file number , magni@@ fication , and the current image shows . &quot;
a menu bar on the top edge and including the tool@@ bar for fast access to the most common functions .
the processing functions of imaging change your photos . no of the functions will change the original photo before you save file stor@@ ing or the kno@@ b save out of the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer recover the original photo once you have saved the picture .
you should therefore request a copy of your image before you change it . this allows you to save it with file storage .
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can re@@ produce the original picture by selecting from the menu File re@@ produce the button re@@ produce re@@ produce in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change that you have been carried out at the photo since the last memory . &quot;
nearly every action of the image processing can be re@@ done or restored . the last action you can be re@@ done or re@@ covered by editing or re@@ produce re@@ produce from the menu .
&quot; if you often use this , you should make the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to return , and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ A @-@ Z to re@@ produce . &quot;
&quot; if you select the &amp; L@@ MB ; over the return , or re@@ produce a moment longer , you get a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions are usually made or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started the image processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same point by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , picture r@@ ally or the entries in the menu file , you will be asked if you want to save them . &quot;
you can get in the photo and forth zo@@ oming in which you can use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the saf@@ est menu .
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : magni@@ fication factor automatically select &quot;
&quot; view full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . you come into the normal view , where you do not want to change the tool@@ bar . normally , you can change it in the &quot; &quot; dialog &quot; &quot; of &amp; D . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current picture , you can print the image file image and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; pressure dialog . you can customize the settings before you print your photo . &quot;
from the main menu you can print some pictures or whole pro@@ positions . complete image can be printed out of your selection . you just need to select the pictures with the default methods and select from the menu Album Ex@@ por@@ ters printing assist@@ ent . if you follow the wiz@@ ard you only need to make your choice .
&quot; the &amp; D came ; main window has a si@@ deb@@ ar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same page row is available without the navigation bar , also available in image processing . it is displayed when one of the five rider is displayed : &quot;
multiple c@@ aches Click on the same rider the page row will appear or disappear into the edge again .
&quot; in the compl@@ ain@@ ment view , you can insert compl@@ eting with unlimited size or insert it . note that the note below . the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are permitted in the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields , so that you can be used by other programs . &quot;
&quot; the IP@@ TC data only support ASC@@ II characters and are stored on 2000 characters . all comments will be cut after 2000 characters and be shaped , if you want to use the IP@@ TC lab@@ yrinth in other applications , you should consider these restrictions . &quot;
&quot; after that you have commented you either use the button , or simply switch to the next picture , the lab@@ eling will then be saved . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the application kno@@ b , there is a button More . with this you can read more met@@ ad@@ ata from the selected file or database . however , you can also read the met@@ ad@@ ata in the files . this will always be done if you have chosen a met@@ ad@@ ata setting , which is always written in pictures . &quot;
the review rating shows a review scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in Su@@ chen and sorting . it can be applied either with a single click on the 5 stars in the page row or with the keyboard short@@ cut Str@@ g + 0 ... 5 . the valu@@ ation from the page row will always be applied to a picture at the same time you choose them and use the context menu .
the review is written in the IP@@ TC field . the coding follows the sch@@ ema in the following table :
the keyword site indicates a search box for filter@@ ing the sampling , the sampling tree and a selection box with the previously mentioned in this &amp; D . &quot;
the sampling tree is dynam@@ ically adapted to the given seek@@ ers . you can limit the number of possibilities in search of a table quickly restri@@ ct . this ability is especially useful if you have a lot of keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom is another relief in the input of keywords in a picture series . if you have given several keywords , they are saved for quick access . &quot;
keyword ( s ) can also be set by mark@@ ings of the corresponding application fields in the tree . all the tags of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field keyword .
&quot; if several images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword , this only applied to the full range , if you want a selection with a keyword , please read the section keyword filter . &quot;
&quot; the si@@ deb@@ ar sampling filter is used to change the selection of images in the main window . normally , the left side bar is used with its album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , keyword , and search views . if addition , one or more sampling filter is used in the right hand , only the inter@@ section of these two are displayed . all asked terms are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also drag and drop it . supp@@ ose you have selected several pictures in the main view . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side bar and put on the selection . then a dialog appears that you ask if you want to place the keyword . &quot;
&quot; in the top example , the main window shows the pictures in a cal@@ ender date . the keyword filter stands out on K@@ eine + a . you were selected with Str@@ g + a , and after that was a keyword created from the right keyword tree on the selection and placed there . a dialog asks if this keyword should be set . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at any time of the program . it can also be swit@@ ched under settings .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and find that it would be or to be , you can easily change this easily with a double @-@ click on the text and in the Reg@@ ulations . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry is looking for the entry in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string , which is already set in the database . &quot;
for example you can set up an extended search across all the elements of the database with the following options :
&quot; if you want to group options , you just need the cross @-@ box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing button . the options then see how follows : &quot;
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flick@@ r not listed ? the free space playground is restricted to 1 GB and you will not save the pictures in the full resolution .
this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted to &amp; D ; s specifically implementation .
the reason why one puts a colour@@ ful workflow from the actually photograph@@ ed workflow and have a predic@@ table devi@@ ation from the actually photograph@@ ed or scanner which allows you to print the colors on your monitor of your camera or scanner and the colours you will publish or in the web you will release them from your digital dark chamber .
&quot; when the topic on color administration comes , then everyone wants to express what is necessary for the outcomes he wants . un@@ fortun@@ ate makes it possible to provide you with adequate background information about color @-@ work@@ flows . in addition , you will provide you with adequate information about color @-@ work@@ flows . in addition , you should make links with deeper information to meet your own inform@@ ational decisions . &quot;
&quot; if your image is fulfilled all the criteria listed below , you must not take care of color . &quot;
you are working on a monitor of the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum calibr@@ ated . ( more information can be found below )
&quot; your only other pictures are sent via e @-@ mail or the web , where s@@ R@@ GB of de @-@ fac@@ to standard is . &quot;
&quot; so s@@ R@@ GB does not work well and the life for everyone is so easy , why should you use another color scheme and so you need to make thoughts on color blo@@ cking ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the limitation of s@@ R@@ GB compared to the colors that we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ ge@@ tic region , and the colors in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some bigger bul@@ bs , please visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excell@@ ente side and click on Info and then on information About R@@ GB Working Co@@ aces . &quot;
do I have to raise my monitor cal@@ ming if I decided to work in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum ?
&quot; yes ! whether you work at s@@ R@@ GB @-@ Far@@ br@@ aum or not , you need to raise your monitor kalli@@ bri@@ er , since s@@ R@@ GB is assum@@ ing the circle . if you work as in the Far@@ br@@ aum by s@@ R@@ GB , then you must either use your monitor on the s@@ R@@ GB default cal@@ ves , a matching monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions , which can improve an image in most cases . use it , before you try a further manual processing . &quot;
&quot; the functions norm@@ alize , c@@ ater , automatic and contrast expand from the menu correct automatic correction automatically try out of your colors to make the best . you will be experim@@ ent with these effects to see what works best in your photo . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ ored the lumin@@ ous values of the entire image , so that the dark@@ est point black and the light@@ est point is as bright as possible without his shade . this function is often a mag@@ ical correction for pictures the dark or balanced . &quot;
&quot; this method j@@ us@@ ted the lumin@@ ance of the colors of the selected image , so that the Hist@@ olog@@ ram of the intensity is as flat as possible . this makes it a very good results in improving the context of an image , sometimes it is also produced only g@@ arb@@ age . it is a very powerful operation that causes either wonder@@ s with a picture or it destro@@ ys it . &quot;
&quot; automatic ab@@ uses : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the Rot@@ - , green and blue can@@ al . it determines the dark and bright border @-@ t@@ ints and j@@ us@@ hing the Rot@@ - , green and blue channels on the complete hist@@ o@@ gram@@ m@@ ical area . &quot;
contrast : this method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the R@@ GB values of an image by means of the lowest and highest values on the greatest possible area and a cur@@ ti@@ usti@@ ft of all values in between . this is only visible in full images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the Weis@@ sen@@ sing of &amp; D came ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out the white relief of a photos .
&quot; the White @-@ correction is somewhat limited because of a Far@@ br@@ aum with 8 @-@ bit per colour , if you can proceed to far from the original picture . if you can perform the White mode on the raw mode , which in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction is better . &quot;
&quot; this tool is based on a white , which is protected by P@@ aw@@ el T. Jo@@ ch@@ ym . it will launch it through the menu entry colors of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the show@@ case can be adapted in the size . on the left side , both the original image as well as the preview of the image gallery . the preview is dynam@@ ically adapted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original character , then it is sufficient to click the bottom window . &quot;
the preview of the Target has a red mark@@ er . the L@@ umin@@ ance of the Pix@@ els under this mark@@ er is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ological .
&quot; right above is shown a hist@@ olog@@ ram that dynam@@ ical will change if you have a parameter change . this hist@@ ram is very helpful , even in well illumin@@ ated pictures , most pixels can be displayed very small L@@ umin@@ ance . with a kno@@ b you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance . &quot;
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and gam@@ ma starting . the sh@@ adows can be able to improve or down the Sch@@ attend@@ et@@ ails of your photos or also down . &quot;
&quot; to use the above controls around the above controls , you should use the color temperature pip@@ ette . click on this button and afterwards to use the color temperature of the White @-@ temperature of the White @-@ temperature . in this manner , the temperature and green values are automatically set . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the whit@@ ep@@ onymous with the list of preferences . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ load indic@@ ator increases the colors if more than a color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. you will be shown the combined result in the white paper . this will be shown as re@@ iner indic@@ ator and has no effect on the final picture .
the buttons save as well as charging this . every setting of the white that you have set you can store it into a text file and then load later .
&quot; the kno@@ b pre@@ ference covers all the filter values back to its standard values and the corresponding neutr@@ ality of the wh@@ ites , so that also neutral settings will be a different photo than your original . if you save this your original picture . &quot;
&quot; you can set up the enco@@ ding off@@ e@@ fe per dy@@ kan@@ al of the edited image . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widespread JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better for high @-@ quality pictures . this coding does not require more turn@@ table , account@@ ancy and stands ready for the formats PNG , PN@@ M , TI@@ FF and DN@@ G . &quot;
&quot; this tool opens the same dialogue as the processing of raw materials . it uses the modification and assignment of color profile . color mapping can be performed by the under@@ window for hel@@ ds . a det@@ a@@ illed manual for the use of color profile , you can draw the chapter color administration . &quot;
&quot; another important tool is available in the menu under colors Ton@@ er correction . this tool provides an integrated way to save several color channels at the same time , so that you can use it for several photos . this is helpful when your camera or scanner always allow you to make the same mistake and you can always find the same mistake . in the manual for tape @-@ tex@@ ture you will find further information . &quot;
a very powerful way to correct ventilation problems is the tool for Gra@@ ding that you can find in colours Gra@@ ding in the menu .
&quot; the &amp; D came ; tool Far@@ be@@ ff@@ ek@@ te presents you four farms , a solar system , a bicycle @-@ filter , a ne@@ on @-@ effect and a cant@@ on filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing has solar isation , also Sab@@ ati@@ er called , a effect of which was created if one created a part developed pressure of a short flash light , and after that the development of the image were finished . the result was a di@@ pped neg@@ ative of the image . this tool allows you to make this interesting effect fine . &quot;
the intensity control the solar isation . at approx . 50 % intensity shows the image which is chem@@ ically possible . another increase is created and finally create a negative picture that is not to generate on phot@@ op@@ ric .
this is an example of the solar system . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is at 30 % .
&quot; the Vivi@@ d @-@ Filter sim@@ ulates the so called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it is different from a satur@@ ation that he makes a stronger contra@@ sting effect . try it simple , he missed many photos . &quot;
&quot; Vel@@ via is manufactured by the mark@@ er for one on day@@ light . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers it very saturated colours in day@@ light and high contra@@ sts . the characteristics make it a lot of photographers for natural fot@@ ograph@@ ers . Vel@@ vi@@ as is also a few photographers , especially those who have little landscapes . &quot;
the Ne@@ on@@ filter sim@@ ulated Ne@@ on@@ light at the contra@@ sting se@@ ams . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sliding repeti@@ tions the strength of the neo @-@ light . in large pictures the filter can load the whole CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not un@@ common that you want to correct the colour ref@@ lex and the lumin@@ osity of the photos . you can experim@@ enting the various colour aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . once you are satisfied with the results you are using the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you make a photo of bad light conditions you can get the reverse issue : one to big satur@@ ation . also in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice for satur@@ ation . all changes you can do in the preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
&quot; between the complex tool gra@@ dation , and the simple lumin@@ osity / contrast / gam@@ ma is the tool sound value to improve the exposure . even if the dialogue concerning this tool is very complicated , only the field of sli@@ der . concre@@ t@@ ely the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ o@@ gram@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph@@ s of the intensity values , a hist@@ ological , of active channels , or the selected area . under the graph@@ s are three sli@@ ders to change and that can be shi@@ fted to change the intensity values of the picture . the left side represents the dark values and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
the easi@@ est way to learn how to learn it is to move the Reg@@ ler to see how the image changes .
&quot; on the right hand , the original and the preview of the picture can be viewed dynam@@ ically . the preview is dynam@@ ically , according to the settings of the image , updated . on the left are the following options available . &quot;
sc@@ aling : with this sel@@ box can be adjusted whether the Hist@@ olog@@ ram with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y @-@ axis is commonly referred . for pictures of a constant color is often the linear history of a single column is dominated by a single column . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic tray is useful .
&quot; three regul@@ ator : the top for the dark t@@ ints , the middle for the light tones and the lower for the medium tones , frequently Gam@@ ma@@ values . &quot;
&quot; the three colour pin@@ pet@@ als can be used in the preview of the original picture , in order to automatically add the input values of shadow , medium and light tones . in addition , there is a button for full automatic alignment . &quot;
&quot; exceptions : the output values allow you to change the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two shelves that can be used to change the output values , e.g. the com@@ pression of the output values can be used for example , while creating a hidden image as an background to see something else in the for@@ eg@@ round . &quot;
automatically : with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity of the image .
save as well as loading : with these buttons , the included values in the file system will be saved and later re@@ charged . this will be used the Gim@@ p Levels format . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and the three colors will use the input values automatically for all sh@@ adows , resources and solar tones . activate the color pip@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image for Rot@@ - , founder , blue and the L@@ umin@@ ous channels . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ loaded index@@ ator covers all color channels , to be over@@ loaded pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is a indic@@ ator that is shown only in the preview and it is no effect to see the final result . &quot;
below you can see an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and Alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is characterized with ( 1 ) and the correc@@ ted image with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand , half of the original and the target picture appears . the preview is dynam@@ ically in dependence on your settings . on the right , the following options are available : &quot;
modifications channel : this sel@@ box allows to use the channel to specify the channel of the module :
in addition to this cas@@ ket there are two symbols to switch between a lin@@ ear@@ ing and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ ic view . for pictures with large areas of a constant color generated the linear mode produces a broad beams . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode also helps the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode .
&quot; if you move e.g. a short stroll to the right , for example , the light tones , then you can see that these bright tones with dar@@ ker dischar@@ ge and which the corresponding pixel resolution can be dar@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original photos , a red mark@@ ings to see . if you want to change this mark@@ ings on the area you want to change the original . create a point on this line and move it up and down to the value according to your taste . &quot;
save as well as loading : with these buttons you can make exactly this . each turn can be saved in the file system and later be loaded later . the file format is called the Gim@@ p spa format .
&quot; if you create this method and the three colour panels , automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of atten@@ de@@ - , middle and solar tones . activate the color pip@@ ette you want to use and click on the original picture to put the control points for the Rot@@ - , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ anz@@ curve . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ loaded Indi@@ c@@ ator covers all color channels , to be over@@ exposed pixel . if in more than one channel over@@ loaded pixels you get the view only displayed in the preview and it is no effect to see the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black white photo picture which was correc@@ ted in the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ can@@ al . shooting and sun@@ shades was set up with the colour pip@@ ette and applied to the cur@@ ves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the correc@@ ted ( 2 ) .
the channel mix@@ er of &amp; D came ; image processing is a tool to improve the shade channels or to change the shade of the photos .
the channel mix@@ er is another highly @-@ developing tool to mix the colours of images . you can edit it from the menu Color channel mix@@ er of the image processing .
&quot; with the can@@ al@@ ley box you can choose the color for the Hist@@ olog@@ ram : this gives you a first note like you can correct the channels by changing the relative distribution and envel@@ ope . the left area of the window shows you a preview of . the original can be viewed as compared to your own rider . &quot;
the preview of the target group has a red mark@@ er . if you position it in the picture appears a vertical line in the hist@@ og@@ ram to show you the appropriate color .
the controls for the module are right down : regul@@ ator for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels as well as you activate the appropriate color components . this is particularly useful when you also activate the appropriate color @-@ mix@@ er then DAS tools for generating great black white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the Grün@@ kan@@ al for Black @-@ White portra@@ its . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially if you mix Mon@@ och@@ rome , leads the reduction of a color to an visible rob@@ bed , which does not appear in the same place in the shade . color is different from each channel . if this is the case you can improve your Mon@@ och@@ rome , thus improve in which you can first reduce the color first . &quot;
the stor@@ ing as well as loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any mix@@ er settings can be saved for later and then load the file format is the Gim@@ p channel mix@@ er format .
&quot; the option over@@ loaded index@@ ator covers all color channels , to be over@@ loaded pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is a indic@@ ator that is shown only in the preview and it is no effect to see the final result . &quot;
below you can see a photo shown in which the blue channel is new . the option L@@ umin@@ ance is enabled . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; black / White photography was always fascinating because of your abstr@@ action . with the development of digital photography . with the development of digital photography , since colour images can easily be converted to your computer . also with a set of film cart@@ ons profiles . &quot;
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super
green filter : sim@@ ulated a black / white filter@@ ing with a green lens filter . this looks good in all scen@@ arios and fits especially good to portra@@ its against heaven . thus similar to 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Green filter .
Oran@@ ge@@ filter : sim@@ ulated a black / white filtration filter . this enh@@ ances landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . thus similar to 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Oran@@ ge@@ filter . &quot;
rot@@ ors : sim@@ ulated a black / white filter@@ ing with a red line filter . this creates a dramatic effect and can sim@@ ulate a moon@@ light to day@@ time and can sim@@ ulate similar to 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ filter .
yellow filter : sim@@ ulated a black / white filter@@ ing with a yellow lin@@ sen@@ ation and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow@@ ing filter .
&quot; Sep@@ iat@@ on : generates warm bright and medium tones while he added a bit of cold in the shadow &apos;s blow@@ s . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother , and thus similar to the photos of your grand@@ mother , and thus similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter . &quot;
with the &amp; D ; tool tex@@ ture apply you can apply decorative tex@@ tures on one image .
&quot; adding a tex@@ ture to your image , regardless if it is a color picture or not , you can look like an oil screen on a canvas , the st@@ ork of an old master , a pop style portrait of enlarged points , or like a wall image on a wall . the menu entry image tex@@ ture can be used for it . &quot;
Rel@@ ief : move this parameter to the right increases the depth of the depth and three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the tex@@ ture on the image .
a paper tex@@ tures has been applied in the photo below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter Rel@@ ief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; D ; tool frame can add a decorative frame to add an image .
keeping the eye of a spect@@ ator in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . a way to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative frame . this is a psych@@ ological barri@@ ers for stre@@ aming process . under the picture frame can be started using the module .
type : with this parameter you provide the desired Rah@@ al line for your image . throughout the picture with a colour@@ ful line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce embr@@ aces it with a thin three @-@ dimensional frame of ideal for a button @-@ dimensional and decorations adds a decorative frame with patterns . &quot;
&quot; width : returns the width of the frame in percent . the value range for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % . &quot;
&quot; this is bigger than the frame of decorative destinations will be larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing of images , especially if you have used the tool suitable for aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; with this practical tool , you can easily insert a formal text into a picture at any point . this also goes to several places where you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text color , orientation , color from the color area and the character set with its features such as you need . you will simply choose the character set . in conclusion , just choose a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ clear background . already the picture is ready . &quot;
&quot; each setting you have chosen for your text , can be changed until you have been stored on the button &quot; OK &quot; , the text part of the image . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
with the &amp; D ; tool Schab@@ l@@ one can apply a template on a picture .
the menu image template uses in image processing can be used to make sure about an image .
&quot; for the sten@@ cil , there are no restrictions on the size and orientation . if you want to add the PNG format and should add with maximum com@@ pression ( 9 ) to enlarge the file size of the sten@@ cil , just send an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; D &apos;@@ mailbox @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .. &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool at first time , you need to put your sten@@ cil with the kno@@ b base folder in dialogue . select the folder in which you will be copied to the template . these settings will be displayed for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root ord@@ ner for the ri@@ bbon was released a construction view , which reflects the folder structure of the Schab@@ lon@@ en@@ folder . the selection of a folder updated the default bar automatically . &quot;
&quot; under the preview there are three buttons , with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image . &quot;
&quot; enlarge : this kno@@ b enlarged the dar@@ ling picture . it is center@@ ed to the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; in this kno@@ ck@@ ers , the lower picture is center@@ ed . if you want to apply the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to hide the image according to the left mouse button . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move the button to move the image below the template under the template . take the picture and place it at the desired location .
use OK when you want to apply the template to your image . the picture will then be adjusted automatically the default size .
&amp; D came ; sets three different tools for pen@@ alties . each of you have advantages in other areas .
&quot; shar@@ pen is a traditional tool for pen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but created , especially in dark fields , gran@@ ularity . &quot;
Un@@ shar@@ fe @-@ Mas@@ ke works on the contrast to look a picture shar@@ pen@@ ing to look a picture . actually it does not use it to remove atmosp@@ h@@ eric Dun@@ st and it makes it a really good job . the algorith@@ m was taken out of Gim@@ p and he is protected by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang .
Re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ing is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the har@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its use and has various parameters for adjustment .
photos without focus as well as most digi@@ tis@@ ed images need a correction of the bulk materials . this in turn leads to a common color together . the same phenomenon can be observed if color points are printed on paper . SLR cameras will normally require more in@@ compatible with the normal cameras for the private user .
in JPEG image often have been applied to a camera internal shar@@ pen@@ ing . images in the raw material on the other hand must always be shar@@ pen@@ ed during processing .
&quot; some scanner turn a shar@@ pen@@ ing filter already during the reading of the picture . if you dis@@ able this , you get the control over your image . &quot;
in some situations you can find useful results by pressing a photo with the sh@@ ov@@ ens value . that you can correct with the menu entry .
&quot; but you should deal with caution , as the results does not seem very natural : the shar@@ pen@@ ing of the ed@@ ges , but also reinforced the smo@@ kers of an image to correct the tool . you can find more information on the menu entry . under Re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ing , you can find more information and a comparison of all techniques to shar@@ pen@@ ing . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too tight . the solution to record the picture is a little soft and experim@@ enting with the menu entry . use the device on the right side of the dialog it shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter bl@@ ur@@ red is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils of your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and the preview help the image to edit . the show@@ case indicates the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the standard values often produce good results and should first step forward . an increase in the radius or the amount will rein@@ force the effect . if you generate the Unknown Mas@@ ke , become rob@@ bed and the impression of gr@@ ats in the vicinity of sharp edge . &quot;
the radius represents how many pixels that are affected by the filter by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . they should therefore take pictures best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wis@@ hl@@ ist picture that is added to the original . thus the strength of the har@@ ness is set .
&quot; the sw@@ elling value is a fr@@ action from the maximum R@@ GB value and the use of difference . it can thus be applied to minimal differenti@@ ation for a edge of the filter . in this way , areas with a soft change between the tones of shar@@ pen@@ alties and therefore beauty @-@ surfaces are avo@@ ided . &quot;
this is an example of the bl@@ ur@@ red filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image the ( 2 ) . bl@@ ur mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a sw@@ elling = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; D came ; Tool Re@@ focal ref@@ unds a picture by improving the har@@ ness . it used to be protected by copy@@ righted un@@ folding filter -@@ algorith@@ m by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
&quot; this tool is trying to make a picture of &amp; quot ; ref@@ oc@@ us@@ ation quot ; in which it makes a better approach than trying to shar@@ fy the photo . it is used for using a technique called F@@ IR Wiener filter@@ ing . Re@@ focal points usually reaches better results as un@@ sharp mas@@ king . you can start it from the menu by selecting colors Re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ing in image processing . &quot;
&quot; in practice the circular is much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos; sche F@@ altung . the Gau@@ ß &apos; sche F@@ altung has a very long tail , which leads to the mathemati@@ cal outcome , which is far from the original qu@@ ell@@ pixel . the F@@ IR Wiener In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding is influenced in most cases even very strongly influenced by the remote pixel . it causes un@@ wanted results . &quot;
circular har@@ ness : this is the main parameters for the use of this module . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most pictures should result the default value 1 good results . you can add a higher value when your image should be very bl@@ ur@@ red but then on it is used .
cor@@ relation : an increase in cor@@ relation can help reduce arti@@ facts . usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1 ; &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the cor@@ relation reduces the shar@@ pest effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in diamond filter can help you to reduce the values of 0 @-@ 1 . however values are higher than 0.1 only rarely helpful . if the smo@@ ker filter is too low and eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad@@ ly . a usable value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will continue to taste the image .
&quot; Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche Sch@@ är@@ fe : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos; sche sh@@ ards . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to avoid anno@@ ying arti@@ facts . in most cases you should use this value to prevent anno@@ ying arti@@ facts , so you might also have to increase the cor@@ relation and / or noise . &quot;
mat@@ ri@@ et size : this value determines the size of the transformation size . this value determines a good results especially if you choose big values for the circular har@@ ley or the Gau@@ ß &apos; s sh@@ ards . in most cases you should choose great values for these parameters . in most cases you should choose a value in the area of 3 @-@ 10 .
the stor@@ ing as well as loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . each Re@@ focal parameter gives you set to be saved for later and then can be loaded later .
try all the tail@@ ing , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the image before you use the module . &quot;
otherwise you should use the module before you change the picture before you can change the picture . the reason for this is that much operations changes are not visible immediately but later un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts .
&quot; if you are reading images and com@@ press , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ com@@ pressed image . &quot;
generally produced bl@@ ur@@ red Mas@@ k@@ els better results as sc@@ arf . this could be caused by bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king a larger neighborhood used as scar@@ fs .
theore@@ tically you need to bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king always have to create arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never show the effect of the Unknown filter . practical is the result of the F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ ters are always at least as good as the Un@@ ri@@ pe Mas@@ ke . the F@@ IR Wiener Filter is often better in the processing of small details .
&quot; below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused picture , see : &quot;
the original un@@ sharp color picture has to be correc@@ ted . this picture was made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused outcome is due to in@@ sufficient light for the auto @-@ focus lin@@ se .
for more information on the methods for use in digital images you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the Reg@@ ler Gl@@ ät@@ te continues the shar@@ pen of the area of the dis@@ gu@@ itars in order to create a natural p@@ up@@ ille .
the dy@@ song@@ te enables a customized color for the P@@ up@@ ille . if you want blue eyes instead of dark On@@ es you can adjust this here .
the tool image of image is one of the most developed tool to remove not desired arti@@ facts with un@@ parall@@ eled speed .
the In@@ tra algorith@@ m was developed by the IMA@@ GE Team of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
&quot; this tool contains various pres@@ ets as starter , in order to simplify restoration . the available settings are listed below : &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the filter settings in a file , you can use the tab Gl@@ ory and advanced settings . &quot;
detail@@ ing p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the conservation of the details . a small value leads to a moderate gl@@ az@@ ing over the image . a value of 0,@@ 9 should receive details such a homogen@@ eous regions gl@@ az@@ ing and details required . please note that the details always should be sub@@ ordin@@ ated always of the Ri@@ bbon @-@ depen@@ dency . &quot;
&quot; dependence of Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es equal in all directions , while a value can be close to 1 only in a direction . if you create a film gran@@ ulation or CCD Rau@@ l will generate a high value of a similar pattern . JPEG arti@@ facts will be considered by one value in the vicinity of 1 . &quot;
gl@@ az@@ es &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smo@@ othing factor above all@@ ure@@ p then defines the relative smo@@ othing . put this value therefore suitable to the degree of space in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects greater structures . the higher this value is , the more it is necessary , as it is difficult to generate the geomet@@ ry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s tur@@ mo@@ t effect , it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
repeti@@ tions : returns on how often the algorith@@ m is going through . normally there is 1 or 2 .
&quot; Wink@@ el@@ gradu@@ ated da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ ot@@ rop@@ en Alpha . if Alpha is small , it should also be small to create a long run time . they should therefore take this value as greatest possible and acceptable to your needs . &quot;
&quot; integrated step @-@ wide &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integrated step @-@ wide in pixels . you should avoid the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel gl@@ az@@ ing and never bigger than 2 . &quot;
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you get through an@@ election of this option is only low . he dou@@ bled but the run@@ time . we recommend it to allow him .
the buttons save as well as charging this . any adjustment of image errors can be saved in a text file and later be loaded later .
&quot; image errors is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still be very long and a high CPU load after itself . you can therefore ab@@ ort the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b . &quot;
below you can see how image errors with Small Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te can be correc@@ ted . the module will be seen in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you see there is a peculi@@ ar black ornam@@ ental during the trip is caused by a poor film storage during the journey . it is seen below ( 1 ) and the correc@@ ted image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; D came ; smo@@ ker is a very powerful tool to reduce images . it uses a copy@@ righted algorith@@ m by Peter Heck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool displays select@@ able image filter available to remove flu@@ kes and other arti@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens , too . it can also be used to remove Sens@@ ors from the camera or Mo@@ ire@@ ac@@ ute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about Sens@@ orization of Dig@@ ital@@ cameras , so you can read this in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene which has done with a digital camera and a high standard sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ularity that can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you only need the under@@ window details and the under@@ window advanced settings can remain in the default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) up to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is needed for the filter . great values increase the time that the filter is required per pixel and can cut the image into it by the radius and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and thus smaller mistakes . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ är@@ fe : controls the pixel changes . this value uses the pixel changes . if it is increasing , you may change the ed@@ ges , if you change this setting . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filters can no longer receive and smo@@ kes or lubric@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; Kan@@ es : controls the cant@@ at@@ ability for the har@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response . if it is too strong and can occur . put it on a value close to the maximum , if you want to remove an alert room or JPEG @-@ arti@@ facts without losing details . &quot;
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to change to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process which is controlled by the details of the settings .
color : controls the color toler@@ ance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to change a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process which is controlled by the details of the settings .
&quot; GAMMA : controls the gam@@ mat@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance levels of the dark fields , which typically dep@@ endable more strongly to increase . he also lubric@@ ated the sn@@ atten@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; Atten@@ u@@ ation : controls the adjustment of Ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ ing . this value defines how fast the adap@@ tive filter radius is responding to variations , if he is too high it can occur . if he is up to a minimum , can remove it and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter at the ed@@ ges . he can remove it and is the recommended method for it . &quot;
&quot; save and loading : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters for smo@@ ker reduction , which you have set , can be saved into the file system and later loading . &quot;
this is an example of how smoking can change your life . the original image is characterized with ( 1 ) and the correc@@ ted with ( 2 ) . the pre@@ f@@ duction was applied with the standard settings .
sometimes a picture with cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution to record the picture is a little soft and experim@@ enting with the menu entry . use the device on the right side of the dialog it shows the effect of this surgery on your photo .
the &amp; D came ; Photo Restau@@ ration is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to reduce photo sources .
&quot; this filter for rest@@ ruc@@ ture gives you the opportunity to remove lots of un@@ wanted arti@@ facts . it is very well adapted to the pal@@ ate , com@@ pression , com@@ pression , com@@ pression , com@@ pression , com@@ pression , com@@ pression , com@@ pression , com@@ pression and thereby gives the content as well as the human eye . &quot;
&quot; the same algorith@@ m can be used for dy@@ es and tex@@ ture . the tex@@ ture is carried out with a different tool , the sculp@@ tor has been carried out by the IMA@@ GE Team of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ rich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
&quot; JPEG arti@@ facts reduce : the com@@ pression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a ver@@ lu@@ st@@ olen com@@ pressed image ; - small standards that are to be seen in un@@ com@@ pressed image . this setting is intended to correct these problems . &quot;
the buttons save as well as charging this . every setting of photo @-@ restoration can be saved into a text file and later be loaded later .
photo @-@ restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . it can still take a long time and a high CPU load after itself . you can therefore remove the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b .
below you can re@@ discover how a photo with like @-@ like Rau@@ ma is restored .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that with a min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO was included . you can see the original footage on the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the correc@@ ted under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo @-@ restoration . this time tex@@ tures has been created on an old color photo that was created with a scanner which was created by the sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lighting and phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original picture is among ( 1 ) and the correc@@ ted image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the &amp; D came ; Tool Hot@@ pixel permits it to remove images from photos that have been made with an CCD camera , eight have been removed . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pix@@ i project , which are copy@@ righted by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p . &quot;
&quot; bright , total or hot pixels are particularly in high @-@ quality raw materials photos a problem , since many cameras with JPEG com@@ pression have a built @-@ in op@@ pression for hot pixel . &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel ; and &apos; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &apos; quot ; bright pixel method . there are currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
Download this file into the wiz@@ ard with the button dark picture . the tool will automatically identify the hot and bright pixel . these are highlighted in the image .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important to discover the dark picture directly in the connection to discover new hot or bright pixels by the CCD Def@@ ec@@ te . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should load the matching dark picture to the correct image . take note that the wiz@@ ard will find the final dark picture and this automatically invites you to the next meeting . &quot;
the image area and the preview help you to correct the result . the show@@ case indicates the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are highlighted in all pre @-@ view areas .
choose an area around the def@@ ective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ish this pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
&quot; thir@@ section : it is determined an average of the conversion pixel . the color is assigned to all def@@ ective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels that have to have a distance from 1 from Pix@@ el@@ block will be drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ lin@@ ear@@ ing surface ( 2 @-@ DIM ) or a group of linear cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ DIM ) or a group of linear cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ DIM ) or a group of linear cur@@ ves in the block to inter@@ pol@@ ish .
square : this is the default filter method . all pixels with a distance from 2 or less to pixel block will be raised to calculate a bi square surface ( 2 @-@ DIM ) or a group of square cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ DIM ) or a group of square cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ DIM ) which is used to inter@@ pol@@ ish the pixels in the block to inter@@ pol@@ ish .
&quot; Cub@@ an : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be drawn to calculate a bi @-@ k@@ ub@@ lic surface ( 2 @-@ DIM ) or a group of Cub@@ an cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ DIM ) , which is used to inter@@ pol@@ ish the def@@ ective pixels in the block to inter@@ pol@@ ish . &quot;
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction to a color photo from a def@@ ective digital camera with a Sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original picture was enlarged on 300 % enlarged ( 1 ) and the correc@@ ted image is under ( 2 ) .
&quot; the &amp; D came ; Vign@@ et@@ tier@@ rection is a tool to correct the Vign@@ ol@@ ocation , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image . &quot;
&quot; degree angles , in particular , in the middle and large photo format , often illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area not compens@@ ated . instead &amp; quot ; v@@ ign@@ et@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ iel@@ ding ) they can reduce the corners of the sensor , by giving the light to the sensor there . Tele@@ objective , under circumstances also demonstrate this behavior . &quot;
&quot; but he also has dis@@ advantages . many center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 in the blad@@ der filter , which it is impossible to keep the camera with the hand . W@@ eit@@ ing object should also use with Center @-@ Filter , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , because otherwise non@@ sense effects . &quot;
&quot; with the great exposure ranges from today &apos;s filtration and white sc@@ anners and grey scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a Center@@ filter by offering a qui@@ valent transformation by an Center@@ filter by an Center@@ filter on an image . the algorith@@ m is protected by John Wal@@ ker . &quot;
with three controllers you can control the Vign@@ et@@ tier@@ able filters and with three further the exposure of the target .
&quot; density : this parameter controls the level of light density , at the point of biggest density the filter . the standard density is 2,0 , with an aper@@ ture adjustment of 1 , or random@@ ly a light intensity of 2 , un@@ cle@@ .@@ increases the density around a larger degree of Vign@@ et@@ ching , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ osity , double @-@ contrast and Gam@@ ma settings : the editing of an image with the Vign@@ et@@ erti@@ fication correction is decre@@ ases the lumin@@ osity of the image . you need to re@@ produce the exposure of the target with these options . the Reg@@ ler provide you only positive values as you have to only increase the settings . &quot;
if you want an enemy @-@ adjust@@ ing of the target image so let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / gam@@ ma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; D ; image processing from the menu Color Gra@@ ding .
this is an example of the Vign@@ et@@ ching correction factor in an image . the original picture ( 1 ) shows the characteristic picture of the corners and ( 2 ) the correc@@ ted image . a leu@@ ka@@ emia and contra@@ sting correction was also carried out in the image with this tool .
the &amp; D came ; Lin@@ sen@@ ver@@ zer@@ land@@ er is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ righted algorith@@ m by David Ho@@ d@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric dist@@ or@@ tion . colorful dist@@ or@@ ations cannot be correc@@ ted with this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second gra@@ dient covers the general geomet@@ rical dist@@ or@@ tion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ v@@ ch form of the picture .
the co@@ efficient of the third gra@@ v@@ ulture has a similar tour effect , but flat to the ed@@ ges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
the co@@ efficient fourth Gra@@ des correc@@ ted the distant corners to the second gra@@ f . if you combine these two can combine any geomet@@ rical dist@@ or@@ tion almost eliminated .
general : this value controls the strength of the dist@@ or@@ tion of the second gra@@ ins . with negative values can be correc@@ ted and negative values of kis@@ ses dist@@ or@@ tion .
&quot; corner : this value controls the strength of the dist@@ or@@ tion of the fourth Gra@@ des . this value appears stronger at the r@@ ashes than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; corners parameter the reverse sign of the parameter . &quot;
zoom : this value scal@@ ded the du@@ its and thus carries out a correction of the first gra@@ ding by . negative values enlarge while positive the image dec@@ lined .
&quot; light : this value , the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values reduce the brightness of the image into the corners , while positive values they increase . &quot;
&quot; in order to help you find the best filtration settings , illustr@@ ated the dialog with a preview the dist@@ or@@ atory correction . the values you use for your image will be stored and used while the next start as standard values . &quot;
the tonn@@ - or kis@@ sing@@ ular correction should be done before all re@@ ed@@ ges or greater changes . in case you perform this correction as all of the first . if you do a picture new to cut and then perform a de@@ dly correction would be the effect of the fal@@ seh@@ ood of Fal@@ se .
&quot; to help you find the best correction line you will find this tool a vertical and a horizontal guide . move it to an important place , such as the sea side or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . in connection you can fix the tonn@@ - / kis@@ tic@@ ular dist@@ or@@ tion with the help of the lines . &quot;
if you correct a kis@@ ful aber@@ ration will correct the resulting picture of black corners . you can transform this with the cutting @-@ tool in the menu transform@@ ing out of the image processing or via the zoom control of this dialog .
&quot; for most images , the tonn@@ s correction is sufficient . the next logical step for some moti@@ ves such as shots from the front , frame and paintings , it &apos;s the perspective so to correct all angle in the picture 90 degrees . note that if you keep the camera with the hand you will always keep an easy dist@@ or@@ tion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the tonn@@ s correction is applied to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the correc@@ ted image below ( 2 ) .
the algorith@@ m is based on a method for sim@@ ulating infr@@ ared film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u@@ .org website that is available under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infr@@ a film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
in the left side of the window you can select the area for the preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
&quot; below the preview you can set up two parameters set up film gr@@ itt and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the optional films gr@@ itt , if you want to sim@@ ulate the gran@@ ularity of a high sensitive film and domin@@ ance of the colour Green ( Chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in the transformation . green meadows are white as snow ! &quot;
&quot; as the filter color channels to re@@ produce from infr@@ ared film , especially the green channel does not make sense the effect on black / white photos as the color information are missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infr@@ ared fil@@ me@@ tic techniques applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a type of au@@ ra in the hair@@ dres@@ sers .
&quot; the &amp; D came ; filter film gr@@ itt is a simple to use tool to re@@ produce tim@@ gr@@ itt in your images , such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X , known to increase the sensitivity of films , the manufacturers large silver gran@@ ules of the photo@@ em@@ ul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the film @-@ gra@@ zing effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . if you want this particular , Galerie @-@ like , Str@@ ong photograph@@ ed , gran@@ ularity , so you need to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the controller , the ISO @-@ sensitivity can be adjusted to control the intensity and gran@@ ularity of the bas@@ ins . the default value is , although often higher values need to be adjusted to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more gran@@ ny , so you can use the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film compos@@ er on a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed ( 2 ) . the user @-@ sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; D came ; filter oil mo@@ ck@@ ery creates the appearance of an oil st@@ ables . it used to use the copy@@ rights protected algorith@@ m of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; D came ; filter oil gem@@ stones gives your digital pictures a nice appearance as an oil st@@ ables . natural pictures and breast@@ feeding are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two shelves to influence this effect . the Supre@@ me choose the brush size between one and five . th@@ icker brush are suitable for big pictures . smooth@@ es controls the smo@@ othing or , from the other side looked , the hin@@ ts . &quot;
this is an example of the oil st@@ ables effect . the original picture is characterized with ( 1 ) and the machining is characterized with the ( 2 ) and the machining is characterized by the ( 2 ) pixel size for this 640 pixels high image is 1 and gl@@ az@@ ed 17 .
&quot; the &amp; D was used ; filter co@@ le@@ tiz@@ ers are used color and intensity setting in order to create a co@@ read@@ able in the drawing . it is helpful , if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sk@@ ate you . this would have good pictures to start with it . &quot;
there are two shelves with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper Reg@@ ler choose the tab@@ ernacle from and the lower j@@ us@@ sel@@ ects the contrast ( glasses ) .
this is an example of the consistency filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the standard settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be improved by adjustment of the intensity value .
&quot; the &amp; D came ; filter engraving , your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was increased in wax . it used to be protected by protected algorith@@ m of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; D came ; filter engraving is a fast tool to re@@ produce your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works very well in pictures with a simple structure , where color does not use the most important in the content . the filter uses the differences between colour and intensity , to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ dar@@ ing landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth permits to set the contrast to the filtration . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the dep@@ t depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a artwork by means of dist@@ or@@ tion and used by copy@@ righted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : shares the picture in cells and makes it look like it is seen through glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog to the wav@@ e@@ blocks 1 will dist@@ ort@@ ed the picture here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects do not require a long time for calculation and create a high CPU load . you can cancel the effects at any time with the kno@@ b .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a artwork by means of un@@ shar@@ ehol@@ ding effects . it uses protected algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom un@@ shar@@ pen : impos@@ ing the image along lined @-@ shaped lines leading from a central point . this sim@@ ulates the un@@ shar@@ ply a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often in the sports photography .
radi@@ al un@@ shar@@ pen : impos@@ ing the image by rotation of the pixels to a center . this sim@@ ulates the un@@ shar@@ pen of a revol@@ ving camera .
dist@@ ort the image to create the effect of a non @-@ foc@@ uss@@ ed camer@@ on@@ in@@ se . the object seems to be back in the background .
&quot; Rom in the image by horizontal movements of pixels . this sim@@ ulates the un@@ shar@@ pen of a linear , z : B : from a car or train photograph@@ ing , camera . &quot;
&quot; soft@@ ly un@@ shar@@ pen : caught the image into the dark and strong in the light tones . this is ideal for creating romantic portra@@ its , Gl@@ am@@ our photos or add a warm and subtle g@@ low@@ ing . &quot;
har@@ sh@@ out har@@ p : caught the image by random shift of pixels and sim@@ ulates the un@@ shar@@ pen of a arbit@@ r@@ ary camera .
smart un@@ shar@@ pen : find the bul@@ bas@@ ins in the picture and do not hide it without the rest .
mos@@ ai@@ c : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then created it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects do not require a long time for calculation and cause high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the kno@@ b .
the shelves are a cute little tool to make shelves in your picture . this gives it natural to make a wet appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n protected algorith@@ m .
dro@@ pping size allows the size of the drop to change . since the dro@@ pping size does not grow automatically with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size and density of drops . Fisch@@ au@@ gen changes the optical effect of the drop in the image .
&quot; you can stop using the &amp; D ; image processing an area free of shelves . use the tool to choose the area , e.g. a face that should be free to stay free . if you start the filter card free of shelves . &quot;
this is an example of the shelves filter . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; when the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it by mirr@@ ors or turning into the right orientation . the tools can be transformed in the menu to transform or transform the mirr@@ ors . &quot;
photo flash@@ es is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to enlarge a photo to enlarge in a minimum loss of image quality .
&quot; a picture to negoti@@ ate is simple . the big question is , how can you find an image in zo@@ oming ? how can you find the missing information again or guess ? the C@@ im@@ g algorith@@ m which is used here , makes it a good work . try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
&quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can change it to the desired size with the tool size . select to change size in the menu and enter the target values . &quot;
&quot; the tool to change size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to enlarge the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool for b@@ lossom . &quot;
&quot; many educational programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. pol@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; D came ; used a further developed approach . the underlying algorith@@ m photo of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors was developed in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you need to say the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab new size and are listed below :
&quot; aspect ratio maintained : if this setting is activated , the new size is maintained in the original size of the original image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects greater structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is necessary , as it is difficult to generate the geomet@@ ry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; turbul@@ ence effects , it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
the buttons save as well as loading are used exactly . each entry for photo can be saved as a text file and later be loaded later .
&quot; photo flash@@ es is very fast with what it makes , but it can still be very long and a high CPU load after itself . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b . &quot;
&quot; you can see below an example of photo bl@@ ases , by selecting a small color picture on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the Pre@@ view ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard magni@@ fication compared . &quot;
&quot; the cutting of a photo is not just a frequent managed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to compile a picture with the mouse to create a photo using the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and pull the edge che@@ ques , then you will see this rect@@ angle then you will see the mouse while you move the mouse . &quot;
if you let the mouse button again get off the area of the photos out the path is cut off . this gives you a good overview of your photo after cutting . you can change the size of the rect@@ angle . a new rect@@ angle can create it by clicking the left mouse button .
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cutting @-@ button , use the button &quot; button &quot; button in the tool@@ bar and the photo will be tailored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file to save the image file to save the newly set photo . &quot;
&quot; in the default area you can change the size of the rect@@ angle , change the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in dialogue remains intact . &quot;
&quot; in the tool , cutting ratio you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high format , the larger value of the height and in the cross @-@ format of the width is al@@ located . &quot;
&quot; the tool at aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always equal , regardless of whether you are cen@@ tim@@ eters , or any other physical size . you can refer to a list of traditional sizes for Fot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and its aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; at the right end of the dialogue , there are two buttons to be center@@ ed horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; below in dialogue you can use the Max . relationship button to cut down the area for cutting down to the greatest possible , depending on the selected relationship and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool tailored to aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation ( horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically ) . if you are displayed , these settings are displayed as standard values , so that the EX@@ IF data will be reflected in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data will be reflected and not the original image . &quot;
the settings of the compositions allow help to help make it easier to put your pictures better . these help are :
&quot; harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic particles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . as the third @-@ ra@@ ils , harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are a possibility to share a rect@@ angle in similar harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles at the di@@ agon@@ als . &quot;
&quot; Golden middle : the golden center is a division that is based on various natural growth patterns , such as the spir@@ al of a Nau@@ tilus Mu@@ schel or the Bl@@ ut@@ ables of a sun@@ flower . it emerg@@ es in all sorts of things to we as beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden division is the ir@@ rational number , 18@@ 03@@ 39@@ 88 ... and it was used already in the ancient Egyp@@ tians and Gre@@ eks , which used to build your tem@@ ples and pyr@@ ami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i episode 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; ab , where each number is the sum of its two forward numbers . a composition that is this rule follows as a visu@@ ally harmon@@ i@@ ously . &quot;
the golden middle represents fluid @-@ lines if you put an image . these help are recorded below :
the Gol@@ den@@ e Spir@@ ale will bring you better results for your photos . in comparison to third @-@ ra@@ ils produces the golden spir@@ al generates a liquid line of the eye through the picture . this type of composition shows the view of the spir@@ al and create a balanced visual flow .
&quot; another rule are the right corner of golden spir@@ al , also called golden Spir@@ als . this right corner is used to create the golden spir@@ al . this can be a line or different objects . this thing can simply be there without the eye , it will fulfil its task . &quot;
&quot; the Golden tri@@ angles also lead themselves from the above discussed spir@@ al . their ver@@ tices are the center@@ piece of sides of golden tri@@ angles . take note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles can be found in contrast to harmon@@ ious interest , a static object can be dynamic . &quot;
if you use golden tri@@ angles at your frame or create a effect of the professional photographer &apos;s dynamic symmet@@ ry . try your picture on one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in the angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve different .
the options horiz@@ on mirror and vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic particles .
&quot; with the kno@@ b color you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the aid @-@ lines can be invisible . in this way you can customize the color of the lines of your current image . &quot;
the free rotation is a tool to rot@@ ate an image around any angle .
if you make a photo then it happens easily that you are not exactly ver@@ tically or horizontal . this creates a picture in which things turned around a angle . you can easily fix it with the &amp; D ; image processing and the tool free rotation . choose to transform it freely Rotation and j@@ us@@ hing the destination .
&quot; turn your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ ders are specified in degrees . with the kno@@ b pre@@ ference , you can put the sli@@ der again on 0 degree . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the window will be displayed on the right top . &quot;
&quot; for your help , the module makes FREE rotation a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse click on the left mouse button . after you fix it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now , you can drag the angle as described in previous section . &quot;
&quot; after you turn a picture , you will find un@@ wanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to fix it is to fix it the function to cut off the image processing . &quot;
an elegant way to cut the picture is the function automatic cutting . select one of the following options :
the option anti @-@ Ali@@ asing gl@@ az@@ ing the image a bit after the rotation . please note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tiv@@ ic transform@@ ations are conducted by a fixed point of the reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares to the corners of your image . the preview will automatically be re@@ calculated . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective : &quot;
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation . &quot;
angle left at the top : displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transform@@ ated area .
angle right top : displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transform@@ ated area .
angle left below : displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transform@@ ated area .
angle right bottom : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transform@@ ated area .
&quot; according to the adaptation of the perspective , the image will be a little lubric@@ ated . for a single adjustment is small , but two adjustments create a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after which you have noted the perspective you get un@@ happy tri@@ angular holes on the corners . a way to cut this , it is the picture with transform@@ ing re@@ cutting from the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the tool is used to move a part of the image into one direction and move the other part into the opposite . this is not a rotation , the picture is dist@@ ort@@ ed . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a Parall@@ el@@ og@@ ram . you can launch this module on transform@@ ing sc@@ iss@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; put your image by clicking the horizontal angle and the vertical angle . you can press horizont@@ ally and vertical . if you put in pre@@ ference , the angle is displayed on zero . a preview of the effect will display you and the new dimensions of the target range will be displayed on the right of the default area . &quot;
&quot; for your help , a vertical and a horizontal line appears . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the sli@@ der tool to add your picture . &quot;
&quot; after which you have carried out the shot , the image will be a bit conf@@ used . for a single she@@ er this effect is usually ob@@ li@@ gi@@ ble , but two ch@@ illing twice as much as a wis@@ hl@@ ist and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after gradu@@ ation the image has un@@ beautiful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate these , it is the picture with transform@@ ing re@@ cutting from the image processing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D came ; needs a number of libraries and other packages to read and write images , therefore from your system and , in some cases , from the type such as these libraries have been comp@@ iler . in most cases , you will be able to edit a large number of formats with &amp; D . &quot;
&quot; due to this dependence of other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all available file formats , but you will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF . &quot;
&amp; D came ; displays only files in formats of formats . this happens on the file extension and one comparison of these with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list . you can change this list of the file extensions . you can change this list of file extension R &amp; D . in the section configuration you can find more information .
nearly all digital cameras save images in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras allow you to choose to choose the format . a detailed description of this file formats can be found at Wikipedia . &amp; D came ; supported both formats .
image com@@ pression is the application of data com@@ pression drive to digital pictures . thereby the red@@ und@@ ant information is reduced to store the image data on a more efficient way .
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smooth results as JPEG in the same com@@ pres@@ sion@@ al ratio . the 2000@@ s version can also be saved , if this is specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to find out more about the raw materials , so you can read on Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can also convert raw materials in JPEG or TI@@ FF with the raw materials ; in the section configuration you will find further information on the use of modules with &amp; D . &quot;
&amp; D came ; supported the loading of raw materials only with the program d@@ cra@@ w which is supported in &amp; D . hereby present you can be shown below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a brief list of raw materials that came from &amp; D ; supported :

many tools you need to need the photo@@ machining in &amp; M . your description will be followed here .
&quot; all educational tools such as sl@@ ing , soft@@ en@@ ation , soft@@ ness , re@@ percus@@ sion@@ ing , re@@ focus , bl@@ ur@@ red , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog type , which indicates the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image before the filter is applied . below you can see a text user application ; in this dialog : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress window shows the status of the filter on the current image . links from it allow five buttons to change the compar@@ ing field of the default area . these modes are :
ver@@ tically parts without dup@@ lication . the left section shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected tip .
horizont@@ ally parts without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper area shows the original and the lower displays the filter applied to the range below the selected tip .
ver@@ tically share . the left section shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontal . the upper area shows the original and the lower compared to the effect of the filter .
mouse over &apos; style : displays the preview if the mouse is not in the default area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that can switch you to show over@@ - and subj@@ ection . the colors can be adjusted in the general admission page .
( 3 ) : the frame to choose the preview of the preview . you can draw this frame with the mouse in the picture and on the part of the picture you want to view . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
&quot; ( 5 ) : in the left corner of the corner , here is an aid and the possibility to reset all the buttons to your default values . all adjustment from the last use of the module will be noticed . &quot;
the page row properties shows the essential information about the selected picture and is largely expl@@ ored . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters in the shooting of the photos . these data date from the EX@@ IF data if they are available .
&quot; this rider provides an intuitive approach based on the Mar@@ ble mini programme . you can move using the mouse wheel or th@@ omas . click C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to pull out a square . all images within these coordinates are filter@@ ed and displayed . this is of course ahead that your pictures will contain ge@@ o data . &quot;
&amp; col@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used in color pal@@ ettes and to choose and nam@@ ing colors .
&quot; the pall@@ ets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can either be installed for the whole system or only a user . in the latter case , they are used in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user defined color and load @-@ defined colors . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog box you can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets , or search the folder to files . &quot;
the cursor is displayed in the pall@@ et view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area beside a color .
it shows the color in addition . the color is described under the pall@@ et view . here also the colour name can be changed .
&quot; it can also be used to choose from . to create such a selection , click on the area beside a color to move the cursor to the cursor . then move the mouse with pressing left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the App@@ en@@ z@@ feld Bei@@ m Add cursor is inserted under the button , the color is inserted in the colour chart at the cursor , the color is either inserted or over@@ writes a different ; depending on whether the mode is manually selected by writing the cross @-@ panel under Bei@@ m C@@ urs@@ or . &quot;
&quot; a selection that has been created as described in the last section , along with the actions copying , cut and paste . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color covers three values for the shares of Red , Green and Blue and an optional colour name , followed by a Z@@ eil@@ en@@ eck sign , followed by another color , can be inserted in the clip@@ board , can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit . &quot;
the colors in the palette and output of color selection can be drawn with the mouse .
you can choose a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the shade on the left .

the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization allows GPS coordinates in the met@@ ad@@ ata of an image and to process . geographical data will be stored in the EX@@ IF figures of the image and the loc@@ alization can be displayed in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization is available for images geograph@@ ically in spher@@ ical coordinate system , which is used by GPS and Galil@@ eo , used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , long@@ itude and lati@@ tude are used . &quot;
&quot; to download your images with geographical data , you need a GPS Sp@@ ur as an XML file in gp@@ x @-@ format . gp@@ sb@@ abel and gp@@ sman can download the data for you from your GPS device and convert . &quot;
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can be a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images you want to check cor@@ rel@@ ay in the main window and call the menu . to run a possible cor@@ relation between time and loc@@ alization by leading , you need to load a trace cor@@ relation of time and loc@@ alization . this file contains of course data that were taken at the same time at the same time as the pictures of your camera . &quot;
if the file loaded an automatic cor@@ relation performed the coordinates in red . GPS trace data are recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore the camera has to be calculated with the GMT . this can be done with the time zone . place your camera zone .
the setting for maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and compan@@ ion@@ age . lies the devi@@ ation below . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
&quot; if you do not have any trace data from a place , you can edit the gp@@ x @-@ file manually and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then all images in this area . &quot;
&quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in min. can be used if you do not have appropriate data . if you know that in reality an loc@@ ation between camera and GPS , you can put this limits here and then press the kno@@ b cor@@ rel@@ ing to inter@@ pol@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be manually set with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos on the same location . since dialogue will use the coordinates of a call to the next , you just need to use the button OK to put the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the loc@@ ation can also be found and set up and set out . select the appropriate region and enlarge you . select this again , until you must always be selected manually . the card may always be selected manually . the card can always be changed manually between card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode . &quot;
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to hang out the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that the exi@@ box is used to provide a stack of images with GPS data .

&quot; this module can export your albums from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums which are to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is provided U@@ TF @-@ 8 , to make a best possible internation@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; the module has four riders in which the settings can be adjusted . the rider selection allows you to choose to select all albums . in the area below , you can quickly choose a large number of albums . in the area below , the Al@@ ben@@ vor@@ schau and the text of the HTML page will appear . &quot;
&quot; the rider appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each side . this tab is largely explic@@ able to create a page in which each image will also create an own page . otherwise , the picture is displayed directly with your default viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , displayed . &quot;
&quot; the tab album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be stored with all your related images . select a folder that contains the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which includes everything there . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the JPEG format , the EX@@ IF information is also stored in the new images . &quot;
&quot; with other color depth , you can change the standard color depth . that of course also influences the file size . all other settings are self explained . &quot;
&quot; the rider displays , it allows you to customize some of the settings from the album tab for the preview images , which are small images displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window shows the user to how far the action is . click Cancel to break the process .
&quot; when the module created the pages will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program@@ mm@@ ings , in order to show whether mistakes were started to display the preview of the gallery . press closing in order to connect the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I imaging is a very fast and flexible OpenGL bas@@ ier@@ ing tool to look at pictures .

after the start a picture is shown by default in full screen mode . this can be changed into a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG @-@ free module is a tool to change images without imp@@ air your quality .
&quot; this module allows for the actions listed below , images in JPEG format , without the usual losses for quality or met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
the consequence of the di@@ lu@@ de @-@ free storage is to increase the file size since no com@@ pression of color information takes place . this can be found e.g. also in PNG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera is currently not yet documentation . if you are interested in writing , please contact the mail@@ ing list of the K@@ IP@@ I teams under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ org@@ . attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module Metad@@ ata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the mail@@ ing@@ liste k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I teams .
&quot; with the import of the met@@ ad@@ ata module , you can copy data from one image to another . select the file you want to copy in the main program and then call the file image . this will then copy the file image to which you will copy the met@@ ad@@ ata . the data will be copied after you click the button OK . &quot;
this function does not work with all formats . you can copy from anywhere else but not in any target format . JPEG is supported by writing . please check out exi@@ v@@ 2 to see what formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Co@@ di@@ sers module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slideshow .
&quot; the MPEG Co@@ di@@ er module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module uses the packages M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV to the slideshow . &quot;
&quot; all images are automatically scal@@ able to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can create a background color for the slideshow . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium , you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
&quot; you first need the images to be packed into MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . after that , you can start using Extr@@ as MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au create the module . &quot;
the images selected by you are listed under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change the pictures or the content of the list .
&quot; after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you are planning the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , Sec@@ am or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step you should indicate the time in seconds , the speed of the image is displayed below . a low value creates a su@@ dden , a high level of contrast is very smooth @-@ change . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be set next . in the doubt , you should release them black . the name and the path of the generated file you can set below the name of MPEG output file . keep as possible as possible deb@@ ug@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; if you specify a audio file under the name of the audio source file , this will be integrated into the movie . after all settings you have adapted to the generation of film . depending on the speed of your computer you can drink a coffee and enjoy a coffee when you are back again . &quot;
&quot; if an indication appears that Ko@@ di@@ sers or tools are missing , you can customize the paths to the programs of the M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick Packages via the button Settings right below . &quot;
the printing assist@@ ent allows multiple images to print on a sheet of paper along with standard images . this is e.@@ g : useful to print you or print with the Gim@@ p module for direct expression .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import your images to one of three formats JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM or convert . &quot;
&quot; the conversion is based on the command line tools d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original tender of Him is : expect the same results obtained , as the software from your camera profiles . sometimes you get better results . &quot;
&quot; first select the raw files to be converted , and start the module . the Ra@@ w image converter is then appears in the mode for a single image . with the kno@@ b , you can view the effect of your current settings in the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can now create the values new to optimize the conver@@ gence process . the first option deci@@ des whether the camera settings are to be used . the essential parameters such as gam@@ ma , brightness and red / blue amplifier can be modified . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the picture later on . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected , so that you can use the contra@@ sting information . if your camera works in the R@@ GB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch does not have any effect . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion rate . the filename is equal and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a wast@@ ed algorith@@ m and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; the Tagged Image Format , TI@@ FF , ret@@ ains all the information of your image and uses the lu@@ cent free L@@ Z@@ W com@@ pression . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected your images frequently to process or use it later you should not choose the JPEG format , as there is only a limited number of operations . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
if you choose JPEG format you will choose the met@@ ad@@ ata that are included in the JPEG file contained in the JPEG file in the JPEG information .
&quot; if you have adapted to your settings , you can start with the run kno@@ b the conversion . if you want to cancel this process , you can use this process . &quot;
&quot; the stack mode allows you to convert different images to one time . use this mode therefore if you are sure , e.g. by test on a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; however , the available settings are virtually identical to the version for individual pictures . however , this is also helpful to over@@ write file in an earlier attempt . a preview is however not available . the progress window shows how far the conversion will be advanced . &quot;
this module can be used to com@@ press all images in one album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following formats are supported :
&quot; this module may be used to ren@@ ame all images of a album . you can set the pre@@ fix , number of load and the tim@@ est@@ ing of time . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection . it is used to enlarge the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can enlarge the image or enlarge . these are four types of images available :
&quot; proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : biggest change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image of the screen format . &quot;
not proportional : not di@@ spro@@ por@@ tion@@ ate size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
&quot; preparation : prepar@@ es the image for the photo printing . the user can adjust the printing solution and the size of the photo lens . the target picture , including background size , side size and background color , is adjusted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send a selected images with your Favor@@ ite e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to change the pictures previously .
&quot; after which you have started the module , the pictures can be displayed with the images selected by you . via the kno@@ b pictures you can add more pictures . for the last updated image will be displayed on the right side . &quot;
you can also drag images to the picture list and add it to the pictures from the list of the pictures .
with the kno@@ b pictures the selected images are removed from the list of the pictures .
&quot; after you have selected all the pictures you can open with the button OK , the New message window will open the window of your e @-@ mail clients . you just need to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures selected are already attached to the attached images . &quot;
watch out not too many pictures at once . most of the e @-@ mail accounts have to send constra@@ ints for the size of the e @-@ mails . it might be a good idea to send several mails when you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window will be used to change the settings for the ending of the pictures . your configuration is saved and once again use it until you change it .
&quot; select your email from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify in the input field below the right path for your installation . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail Service , you need to install the G@@ mailbox on your computer . you can download this here . &quot;
&quot; after the selection of comments in a attached file , the comments will be mer@@ ged to the pictures into a text file and attached to the mail . &quot;
&quot; PNG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted among the lu@@ st@@ free formats such as TI@@ FF . you should therefore be advised if you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG format , select the original files in the JPEG format , then the original Ex@@ if@@ data will be added to the pictures . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically that you can see the status of the status . your e @-@ mail program will automatically start at the end . with the kno@@ b , you can change this window ? &quot;
after the start@@ up of the Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au will appear a window with questions as you want to see your slideshow . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the option OpenGL transi@@ tions in the presentation activ@@ ates very elegant images with OpenGL . you have to possess an appropriate graphic card because otherwise the slideshow will be very slow .
the option file names can be displayed that the filename can be displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the v@@ eil@@ ing option ensures that the presentation in a final loop is displayed . you can then stop manually with Es@@ c ;
&quot; the option pictures acci@@ dent@@ ally choose that the pictures are displayed in a random order , so it will not be used the order of images in the album . &quot;
under delay between the images can be set the tempor@@ al distance between the individual images . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard . the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transi@@ tions . you should be inter@@ view@@ able before you show the presentation to your friends !
there are more than a do@@ zen over@@ lap between those you can choose . acci@@ dent@@ ally chosen in any transition between images and a different effect .
during the slideshow you can access a tool@@ bar on the top left of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to switch you .
&quot; with this tool bar you can keep the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slideshow . &quot;
&quot; on the left of the screen , you can see the current filename , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module Time &amp; Date cannot be added . if you are interested in writing , please contact the mail@@ ing list of the K@@ IP@@ I teams under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ org@@ . attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background is a tool to set a picture as a background image for working surface .
&quot; this module combines the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your KDE work surface . &quot;
&quot; once you have received your pictures and videos with comments , you can see with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; through these brow@@ sing , see picture . as you can see by comparison with the image , are now in each group , so in persons , places and in the group keywords entries present . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window you will see the categories , for which you have entered information as you have received your pictures and videos with comments . additionally , there are entries to look at EX@@ IF @-@ based information , to view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course the current Thumbnails . in the following each one is described for itself . &quot;
&quot; if you press the mouse to the entry , the view of the browser is changing . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you choose another person , only the pictures are shown on which both individuals are to be seen . through this selection method , you can limit the number of images shown by a few thousand images on a few individual pictures . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all the persons , places and other settings , you can view with preview images to look at the pictures of your efficiency . &quot;
&quot; in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of its name . you can store with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person a private image , that applies also to places , keywords and other categories that you have defined yourself . see the picture . &quot;
&quot; to view pictures in addition to the name , select the button that you can choose the right outside on the tool@@ bar . please note that you can view the view for each category . this gives the advantage for example , symbols with images of people and at the same time a list of keywords can be displayed ( if you do not have any appropriate pictures ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you need to define yourself which image should be displayed for each individual person . in order to view this , you need to display the image editor , as shown in the picture . here you can customize the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and select which part of the picture is displayed and cut down . &quot;
&quot; if you call in the main window to call the entry , you will see a dialog that is very similar to the dialog for the establishment of the image properties . this dialog will look at the picture once again . &quot;
&quot; if you want to enter a character in the let@@ ter@@ ing or description , the compl@@ ements or descriptions of images may be sear@@ ches for this text . if you want , you can also use a date in accordance with the date ; for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all images according to certain name as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures , on which Jes@@ per , however not Anne Hel@@ ene are deduc@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you do not like to read manuals , but rather like to try functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and take a look at the quick@@ start cap@@ tures the screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos .
&quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and select the demo , if you start &amp; s@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu help to launch the menu entry tab ; and you can start some example and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a continuous HTML document to download . &quot;
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the timeline . a picture of this bar see here : . how the name tells you here shows these cor@@ ding statistics about the images in your database .
&quot; the timeline can display several different times . each cor@@ rug@@ ated shows then a different unit . you can switch between the units of years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by creating only 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot;
&quot; the timeline can be used in the following ways : you can change the view entries from the database ( if you select a date , the time bar will always displayed the current date at the moment when you navigate in the preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a section of the timeline , drag the mouse button and drag the mouse over the rul@@ er of the time bar , so if you select a range , you will find in the preview view only pictures of this period . you can click the selection by clicking on a beams of the timeline . &quot;
&quot; &amp; C@@ photo@@ album ; provides you with two options available to create HTML websites with your images , the one is available in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated in the following part of the user &apos;s website . in the following part of the user &apos;s manual , the version is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version that you can create using the File menu . &quot;
&quot; before HTML pages you will have to make some settings . these are divided into three areas content , layout and target . in the following , each area will be described more accurately . &quot;
&quot; first give you the title of the download , and a description which should contain the HTML file later . on the photo@@ album ; HTML example pages , you can see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file is to be created on the overview page . nutri@@ ent information on export files can be found in . &quot;
&quot; last@@ ly , you can select which information on the HTML pages are to be displayed . therefore , you can avoid that all pictures from a party are . note that all pictures of a party are . note that all pictures of a party are . note that all images you can do not use to hide certain pictures from particular view@@ finder . &quot;
&quot; in this area you can define how the HTML pages are supposed to look . most settings options are un@@ am@@ big@@ uous , which is not specifically designed specifically . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can adjust various resolutions for the images . thus , those who have viewing your website and have a monitor that supports maximum resolution of 800x@@ 600 , no pictures can download a resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the vie@@ wers of your site can change the resolution at any time . it can thus search your pictures with low resolution , browse through a lower transmission time , browse through a picture larger than it moves to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this entry field , you place the different folders and the URL in which your website is saved . &quot;
the best way to choose for all your HTML files a base folder and for each subsequent sentence a new sub@@ folder .
&quot; first , you have to select the main folder in which all your images will be saved . this folder will automatically set out and next time you can set out for all future pictures of the location . here you can select either a folder or one of KDE @-@ supported protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your pictures , you can check if this really is visible for the viewer . if you have created for the base folder , a web browser after the pages were created , started . otherwise , the web browser should start here . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if those who created by you created HTML files yet in the final destination , you must manually copy them manually . with it the import function , see correctly , you have to indicate the final aim of the current files , but the base ord@@ ner in which all sub@@ folders . &quot;
&quot; the currently described settings can be obtained all three on base sub@@ folders or URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder created , whose name is set to set out . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking at a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures , so you may have to write an HTML page for viewing the pictures , etc . &quot;
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .k@@ im file . these can import others into your database .
&quot; there are two different types of .k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ whether the pictures themselves are stored with the file or if you have only a short@@ cut to images , that you have all pictures attached to the file , and this file may be so independent . the obvious dis@@ advantage is however the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can edit an .k@@ im file either directly from the menu File Ex@@ por@@ ters ... or together with HTML pages , see , create an account in the file together with an HTML file , this will be an external .k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .k@@ im file looks for pictures in a two way . first , the images are not found in the folder of the .k@@ im file . this is of course only possible if you have created your winn@@ ings in the file using the HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for the export of pictures described you via the menu File menu . &quot;
the most important option of this dialog is whether to act intern@@ ally or external .k@@ im files . it will provide you with the following three choices :
&quot; in the option Manual near the .k@@ im file , you must copy the images into the same folder as the .k@@ im file . &quot;
with the option automatic to copy the .k@@ im file copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically for you .
&quot; .k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most pictures were already com@@ press , and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth@@ while you do not want to com@@ press the files so simply select the option Export file . &quot;
&quot; the last option of this page is maximum magni@@ fier . if you want to send your friends pictures , as the .k@@ im file otherwise would be very large . here you can tell the size that each picture is at most 800 pixels high and broad . &quot;
&quot; if you select a file with the end files from the web browser or from the menu File Im@@ por@@ ters ... select &quot; &quot; photo@@ graph album , the exported database as described in the file . &quot;
&quot; the wiz@@ ard is made up of four steps . first , you need to select which pictures you want to import , then in which folders the images are to be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you are called for the category persons of import@@ ing file person@@ er ( if you are a di@@ ans ) , while this category is called for your database . therefore , you will be import@@ ed in the third dialog box , which categories of the import@@ ing file will be import@@ ed in your database . &quot;
in the fourth step you can import the categories of import@@ ing file with the categories of your current database . an example of this can be seen on the picture .
&quot; it must be easy to browse pictures and look at : if you want to see pictures we often want to see pictures of your Italy holiday and see a picture with your boy@@ friend , you might want to see all images , on which this friend is pic@@ tured . &quot;
&quot; in this hand@@ book you will find the different steps from ( 1 ) giving information about your images , over ( 2 ) the look and reputation , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adap@@ t@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album was started as a program for managing your pictures . it has been expanded and today , it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this hand@@ book is more pictures , but often tie them to videos with one . &quot;
&quot; &amp; C@@ photo@@ album ; saves all its information in the file index.@@ xml in the top folder of its images . this is a simple XML file that you can copy with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy disk or re@@ visions at the CV@@ S . &quot;
&quot; &amp; C@@ photo@@ album ; remember the folder that are stored in which your images are stored automatically again . if you want to read a different folder with pictures , you can start a different folder in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the option -@@ c start . as example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / pictures / index.@@ xml . &quot;
&quot; through the menu entry settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... go to a window , with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , you will find the different settings options . &quot;
&quot; links you can see six different symbols , with which you can view the preview options and options for the viewer . for each setting is a detailed help available to the F1 button and a click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; it was described you as you can set up different properties for any picture , e.g. people , places and tags . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; to see the dialog , which is used to process already existing groups . for each existing group you can choose a let@@ ter@@ ing and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section , sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in the dialogue options you can establish complete members groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group , instead of all groups of a subsidiary . &quot;
&quot; in view you can choose the settings options , which can be available to the determination of the members , you can choose the category you want to configure . in the left window , a list of the current category and in the right list of sub@@ categories . &quot;
&amp; C@@ photo@@ album ; shares his module with other graphic applications such as the K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . nutritional information can be found on the homepage of K@@ ip@@ i .
&quot; the modules can be called by the menu modules . the modules can be described and are not described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , but most modules have a help @-@ side you can call on the module itself . &quot;
&quot; because the modules are used for multiple applications together with each other , it may be used to test the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; demo database , you can either download the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu Help . say not , I would not have not war@@ ned ! &quot;
&quot; the applications that use the modules on K@@ IP@@ I , are very different , allowing it to function some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the dis@@ advantage if you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are not supported in Alb@@ ums : this type of order is not supported , sim@@ ulates it for some modules the order to albums , so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; &quot;
&quot; thereby sim@@ ulated &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which corresponds to the current view , so all images that shows you the picture gallery at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the current album &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the modules also has to pass a list of albums . here goes to the photo@@ album ; as follows : &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s Browser shows the content of a category for example , for example , all persons , then each entry in this category is an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will have the category that you have defined as a category for virtual albums , so if you want to use the category persons , will do so , so if you have chosen people to view and pass this module . &quot;
&quot; as some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible , you can remove it from the list of modules . start the settings dialog and select the modules which modules are loaded . &quot;
&quot; on the picture , you can see an example of a boot screen as soon as you start &amp; photo@@ album ; with your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; as you are used by any other KDE application , you can see above a menu and a work@@ force . under the tool@@ bar you can browse through the tool@@ bar . in the section we will not show you more information about your pictures , then click on this window , then click on the entry images to show you an overview of all existing images . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to view each picture with notes , where the picture was recorded at the picture , where the picture was recorded separately or for a larger number of images certain notes at the same time . if for example on all pictures Jes@@ per is recorded and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen . &quot;
&quot; all these notes may be used for sear@@ ches and brow@@ sing as you can read in the section , if you want to see these notes , if you use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; see three lists with a text field by setting people , places and terms . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as you can always use it again when you enter information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea lies the move of the pictures inside the list : if you have formed a family party , and shown in all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , you can make sure that the used names are moved to the top , the persons are faster and to arrange . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to see a alphabe@@ tically list of list , click on the icon for sorting by date below the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected notes for any image individually , you may want to edit all the selected images and provided these pictures with notes . click in this case simply click on the preview of the picture right above . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it may be more convenient all these pictures to highlight and use the menu item of added entries at once with a note . &quot;
las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . besides there are San Francisco and Los Angeles in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture , you can see a brow@@ sing window of the USA as a super@@ group . to show you that it is about a group class , a special symbol is shown . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to menu , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also submit an entry to a category and put there to make it a sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this is pres@@ upp@@ oses that you are just showing your categories alphabe@@ tically . see this . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the array di@@ alog@@ s by making the cor@@ ns , which form the upper edge of the frame , click , and move from a frame as well as an own window by drawing it out of the window of the window . &quot;
&quot; if you adapt the appearance of the window so tailored to your needs , click on the button options ... which offers you the possibility to save the current structure and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also let a frame completely eliminated . if you want to display this window later , use the kno@@ b options ... and here window a / out . this process can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select the entry images in the browser , you will find an overview with illustr@@ ate image of the currently selected images , or all images you have no filter . an example to see you here . you can configure the size of the thumb@@ nails , by simply drag the mouse button with the middle mouse button , configure . try it simple times . &quot;
&quot; if you leave a picture on the background of your desktop , this picture is set up as a background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; if you click on an image , this will be displayed in the picture . if you have not opened a window with a photo @-@ viewer , a new display will be created . &quot;
you can also delete pictures in the image gallery . simply select the appropriate pictures from which you want to delete and press either the delet@@ ing selection . now the window will appear you see in the picture .
&quot; &amp; C@@ photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can also use the pictures here . of course , you can also use the pictures anywhere , so you have to record the pictures anywhere , so you can see the pictures here . in the picture you can see the pictures of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all of the pictures can be loaded from the hard disk . &quot;
&quot; images , where the right upper corner is cut , are not stored on the hard disk . however , it is available for images 1 @-@ 9 . however , the preview of these pictures are available , so you can view the preview of these pictures . however , you can also view these pictures with the image . &quot;
&quot; as you see this function you need to copy files from folders and to copy it again . if you do not want to ask the entry of the relevant CD . if you would like to avoid int@@ ran@@ ce of your pictures , please buy a larger hard disk to store all images to it . &quot;
&quot; in the menu pictures you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to do a little more privacy , you would like to take a little more privacy , click on current view . alternatively , you can also find all the pictures that can see your little sister and choose the menu entry Alles except above view . &quot;
&quot; in this way , you have set the pictures in the case of F@@ alles should be hidden . if you give the laptop one of your little sister , simply select all the pictures you have locked . if you want to see the pictures again , click on spar@@ row . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered into the picture . to adjust this password , simply select password change in the menu privacy . &quot;
&quot; please note that this photo protection is not very secure . for one there are all pictures on the hard disk and to the other , everyone can read the password as an un@@ encryp@@ ted text , or delete it . this type of password protection is only used for those who with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar with views of private pictures . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you manage all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and hours over hours with it is naturally that you want to consider them some@@ time . for this reason , you can consider her some@@ time . for this reason you can consider it from the preview , as described in . &quot;
&quot; watching the viewer you can see in . it shows naturally the picture , but additional all the information you have about the image , such as who is done on the picture , when and where was it done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the Inf@@ obo@@ x at the top part of the picture you want to see , so you can also configure which information is displayed and whether the information is displayed . all these options are available after a rule @-@ click on the viewer . the next context menu can be seen below . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Inf@@ obo@@ x are under@@ lined . if you click here , see the appropriate entries for this view . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser displays you all images from Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you have selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene were selected . &quot;
&quot; if you have loaded multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and go back by using the keys picture high and image . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these features are also accessible from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run it as slideshow . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , then load a new image after a few seconds . how often it can express a new image , by running the Str@@ g button and Plus or minus . the slideshow is started by the keys C@@ tr@@ l ; S . &quot;
a very useful skill of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is able to switch in full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete seat on the screen . simply use the input button to switch in full @-@ screen mode and back .
if you use the viewer you can turn into the picture and pull out . to the flo@@ od@@ om@@ es you can easily pull with the mouse button . with the Min@@ us button you can r@@ ase the Plus button zo@@ om@@ t into the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom rings is marked and displays the result of the zo@@ oms .
&quot; with the point button you can reset your zoom , so that the picture is not shown zo@@ om@@ ed . with the equal key puts the zo@@ oms , so that every pixels is equivalent to the screen a pixels of the image . &quot;
note that the only Zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations will work in videos that in and look out with the Plus@@ - and Minu@@ ors .
with the script from the context menu you can shoot the picture . this does not work with videos . you can do notes to the current image with the menu item notes from the context menu .
&quot; if you have a look at it , you can find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture . at the moment you can check the picture and configuration dialog of the image to enter these names . however , it may appear to mark the picture and see more pictures . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures on a printer , to see the pictures on paper . to see what photos you want to start watching it as well or bad@@ ly , while you view one after the other . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above gives you the viewer to provide pictures with characteristics , while you view them . features are the letters A to Z and you can put a feature that you can press the appropriate letters , where the features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; once you have made features to your pictures , they are available in your browser . this allows you to edit in . if you want to edit them , so you can easily copy all of them with comments . this is described in . after that you can copy a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
categories and special features can be displayed in the default view . if you add categories to the pictures by clicking the letter for the feature by clicking the picture was selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case allows you to paint your photo@@ album ; on the picture to paint .
&quot; the mix@@ er is not saved with the image , but in the database . on the way you can make your mind later . &quot;
in you can see a picture on the painted . to switch the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then select On the picture paint from the context menu . to finish the mouse button simply click the cross in the tool@@ bar top right at the window .
&quot; to work with &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; you need to have to control the application of the program &amp; Pov@@ ray , but the documentation on &amp; Pov@@ ray ; should you absolutely have read and understood . &quot;
&quot; in the object , you can choose individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the properties properties and shown the object in the wire mod@@ ell@@ - views yellow . &quot;
&quot; you can also select multiple objects simultaneously , but not the object of an already selected object , since all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object in the object , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu . &quot;
&quot; there are m@@ eh@@ re possible positions , the following coll@@ age menu appears , so that you can choose the correct position : &quot;
&quot; with delet@@ ing either from the menu bar , or from the context menu of right mouse button you can remove previously selected objects from the scene . &quot;
&quot; if you have altered properties , click on to apply these changes . do you have invali@@ d values displayed , a message is displayed with a fixed description . then you can click the initi@@ ator report or use the changes with Cancel . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ reference to the object shown with the help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 includes already the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you edit a tex@@ ture or part of a text , you can view a preview in the peculi@@ arity view . &quot;
&quot; press the preview in the peculi@@ arity view and a small example of the scene will be selected with the chosen tex@@ ture , even if you want a sub@@ ordin@@ ate item ( for example a tex@@ ture within a text map and not the entire text map ) , crossed locally . &quot;
the screen@@ shot displays the control points of the camera . you can drag the control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation will be chosen , the control points and it will appear a small cross in the wire model . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shi@@ fts . you can change the shift across with the mouse in the entire window . &quot;
every object has a wire @-@ model stage . you can specify this value relative to the visibility of the higher level object or as absolute value . objects are only displayed when they are selected or their visibility of view is smaller or equal in the tool@@ bar of view of the scene .
&amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; has a window @-@ order as a default . the object and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right side .
&quot; if you do not like the default window @-@ order , or if you need a different arrangement , you can adjust them to any number . you can also store multiple shut@@ ters and easily switch between different arrangements . &quot;
&quot; to an@@ chor a window via or under a present view , drag the beginn@@ ings to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle shows then the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the beginn@@ ings to the right or left side of a view . the new view will be anch@@ ored at the right or left side of this view and extends over the overall height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange several opinions on one another , drag the beginn@@ ings in the middle of another view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the cart@@ on card above in the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window @-@ order are sch@@ web@@ ing views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to resolve a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the beginn@@ ings onto the desktop or click on the small to the left at the top arrow . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the fibre bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between arrow and cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional views in the main window . in the menu view , you will find entries for any type of views . new views are flo@@ ating , you can an@@ chor them at any point . &quot;
the current window view can be saved to the window of window ... save it . it will be shown a dialog in which you can store the window @-@ order under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ dering it . &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ dering , this program has to be properly installed . when this manual was written in &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 not supported . &quot;
to ren@@ dering the current scene click the symbol Ren@@ ders in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry .
&quot; a R@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Pov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image and quality of the ren@@ dering . if you want to create a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can create as many R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview up to full images in the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; click on the icon The R@@ ender settings in the tool@@ bar click on the menu view R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... select , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
&quot; each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , however , it is a name that can be seen the characteristics of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the map &apos;s size , you can see the width and height of the lower image . if you want to ren@@ ew it a small area of the picture , select the cross @-@ section section and enter the image section to the entry into the input fields . &quot;
in the Com@@ bin@@ ary quality you can choose the properties which are used &amp; Pov@@ ray ; for ren@@ ders . this goes by a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ Di@@ ff@@ user Re@@ flexi@@ ons . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the user manual to &amp; Pov@@ ray .
&quot; when a picture emerg@@ es with only one beam every pixel , there are often different errors in cur@@ ves and lines , in addition , sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixels . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . generally see pictures with this property .
if you switch anti @-@ ali@@ ing to switch and connects &amp; Pov@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling .
&quot; &amp; Pov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is a adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the super @-@ sampling is adapted ; recur@@ sively because every pixels is still further divided and adapted for the records of the calculated color values . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray stepp@@ ed up to the nearby pixels with super @-@ sampling , then both pixels by the tracking of a given additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the down@@ turn on 4 , a grid of 4x@@ 4 additional points will be charged at a down@@ hill of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixels . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixel is calculated : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color values , the pixels was divided into 4 sub@@ pixel , which can be pursued individually and on further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of records can be set up with the dep@@ ths . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the production of noise for the Stra@@ w process , called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you switch J@@ itter@@ ing , modified &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
&quot; the last setting for quality of Ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experim@@ ental property of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; , the diff@@ use light reflex@@ ion . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property . &quot;
&quot; on this map , you can adjust whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixels is then transparent if the corresponding radiation no object met . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window to display the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ Con@@ sol@@ der version . if &amp; Pov@@ ray is un@@ expected , you can find the reason for this . &quot;
to import a &amp; Pov@@ ray ; select menu entry to import the menu entry ... and choose a file in the dialog box .
&quot; currently , &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er : not yet supported the full command circum@@ ference of &amp; Pov@@ ray : . when entering be@@ et@@ ing messages or war@@ nings occur , a dialogue window shows a list of all reports . &quot;
if you do not support source text in &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; please write this source code between the two special comments / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object into the editor to import the source text for &amp; Pov@@ ray . this adds the source text in the editor to import objects into the scene , simply highlight the source text in the editor and drag it to the object . &quot;
with copying and inser@@ tion in &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can also insert source text for &amp; Pov@@ ray ;
the POV @-@ Ray command is called if &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ dert . usually this is Pov@@ ray or x @-@ Pov@@ ray .
&quot; click on the help in the peculi@@ arity view , opens &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user document presentation to the displayed object . put here the path to your documents and the version . supported the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Pov@@ ray : sear@@ ches for external files ( for example flat field ) in the paths to the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ libraries . if you include files , you will also enter the path to those files here . if a file comes in different paths of the library , the first found file will be used . &quot;
the colour for the wire models . the second color is used for display of selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for display of selected control points .
the colour of the rect@@ angle for the view in the camera view and in the window type features .
&quot; you can adjust the object of the points to the R@@ aster in the context menu of the wire model . you can adjust the R@@ aster separately for shi@@ fts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; greater values result in an accurate measurement model and thus a better nails for the objects shown , but require more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects such as the ball can adjust the detailed stage for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you pass on the high amounts of details for extended proj@@ ections , all the wire and advanced proj@@ ections are used . extended proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions to the perspective and vertical proj@@ ections . this property yield a better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time to Ren@@ ders . &quot;
if you &apos;re sitting walls are displayed a wall behind the objects . the wall is shown in a chess pattern of two single @-@ adjustable colors .
when you view soil blow@@ ing a ground below the objects displayed . the floor is shown in a chess pattern of two single @-@ adjustable colors .
if you activate cant@@ at@@ ment activate the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method for the ren@@ dering of the scenes . the values for depth and sw@@ elling can be used . more detailed information on parameters can be found in the section R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di .
on this page you can change existing window @-@ ordin@@ ations or create new window @-@ ordin@@ ations . in the window Framework will be explained as you can create window @-@ ordin@@ ations .
the Com@@ bin@@ atory field default : displays all existing windows regulations . &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; used the chosen window order at the start of the program .
the list of existing window regulations shows all existing windows regulations . a new arrangement you can create with the button adding and delete a select arrangement with the kno@@ b delet@@ ing .
each window order will be identified by the name . the name must be clearly and must not be empty .
the list under the name displays all views for the chosen window order . new views can delete you with the kno@@ b adding and delete selected views with the kno@@ b delet@@ ing .
&quot; the position of the new window . with new column gives you a new column on the right side of the existing windows , with Bel@@ ow you will get the window under the existing windows , with map card , you will receive a card @-@ card view together with the previous view and sh@@ ackl@@ ing the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
so you just have just &amp; Pov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to follow without more accurate knowledge of the two programs . if you can follow the ultimate yet simple scene with cont@@ ex@@ ts very popular : a ball on a plane .
&quot; but you should carefully consider the following warning carefully , take you as a result just a black screen . if you use a 3D program , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied to the ren@@ dering as a result you receive a black image . &quot;
if you do not insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black image . &quot;
if you have installed all error @-@ free when you start at the first start of &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; the following pre@@ defined window :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . read the documentation so you can get an adequate idea of what you can expect from this program .
&quot; you will have to use these menus and symbols frequently , so you should remember the menus and symbols as well as their application . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to remove this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object . select the scene and select the menu entry . therefore , you now have a scene without objects . &quot;
the wire model shows how the camera looks the whole scene which you generate . in particular you notice it in the fourth round @-@ model view ( right down ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the ren@@ der@@ ns of the scene .
&quot; the object now contains a new entry containing the name camera . if they click on it , see the contents of the view object in which the various parameters of the camera can be found . in the user document , you will find further details . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t change anything at the basic settings of the camera , this is later to be reserved , but note that the camera can change in the view of control points , with which you can change the target item on a Kon@@ T@@ roll@@ point and drag it to the desired location . &quot;
&quot; if you apply the button , apply the wire @-@ type views and the object @-@ tree instantly according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could insert a qu@@ ader ( Inser@@ ted body Qu@@ ader ) and the size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a comprehen@@ sible method of solving this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simple way . you can use an infinite level as soil :
&quot; a good advice : select the layer in the object , change the name and press the button to apply the button . in the producer , the new name is instantly displayed . &quot;
&quot; the wire @-@ model @-@ view now indicates the level , although at the moment it is only a limited final level . if you ren@@ dering the scene , stretching out the plane up to the horiz@@ on . &quot;
&quot; when you view the item &apos;s tree , you will notice that you click on the icon + prior to the object . in this case you will find the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties . &quot;
&quot; in this scene , you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horiz@@ on line , just to meet some of these parameters . select the shift and place the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; only choose the ground to suit its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something in the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialogue can be inserted in which you can choose how the object is inserted . please select the name in the property tab . you can see the name in the peculi@@ arity view ( name = soil pigment ) , with a click on the button preview you see how the pig@@ ment now looks . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of pig@@ ments only shows a Matt@@ es black material , because you need to check the settings for the pig@@ ment . therefore , you can always remember the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview . now there are many possibilities , but do now take the easi@@ est . &quot;
&quot; if you look in the preview no color on qu@@ ader and ball , just click on the button and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is right now . if you are looking for your picture with a click on the icon , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; of course , this is not the shade . here are some other settings necessary . in the color list you need to enter two new attributes . then choose this entry twice ( you can also do this more frequently , but the chess board list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
choose in the object of each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
&quot; this step should take you already simple , since you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; you should have understood the ball is just as easy as the ground : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the object properties you can instantly change the settings . Set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget the input button or button use ) , so the ball is moving with the ground . otherwise the ball is moving over the ground , since you post@@ pon@@ ed the ground around a unit down@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; of course , the ren@@ dering is now a strange result : how already seen before , the ball @-@ surface appears like a Matt@@ es black material . put in the following step an appropriate material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can assign its material now . as already in the soil , you give the ball a pig@@ ment as colour : &quot;
&quot; select first sub@@ object and change the name for example in sphere pig@@ ment . click on ball pigment , then choose a coloured and place the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; but you can reach more interesting effects , if you are taking the time to set some Fin@@ ish properties : &quot;
then change the values like in the following screen@@ shots and click to apply or press Enter .
&quot; the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection do not result in partial visual effects , perfect for glass or chrom@@ ed surfaces , even if metal : still not selected : &quot;
&quot; you should have a good impression of what opportunities offered to you &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; hopefully , you have already learned so much that you can easily create beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ tr@@ y@@ am is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional scene of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
&quot; if you have a scene ray@@ trac@@ en , sho@@ ot@@ ted the ren@@ derer from the perspective of the viewer ( d. h. from the camera , which will affect the scenes in the scene and how atmosp@@ h@@ eric effects such as fo@@ g . thus the scene pixels for pixels is edited . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will be able to see nothing without a camera with which you see the scene . without a light source you can also see nothing , the picture is just black . obviously , every scene which should be saved , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
in the usual file dialog you can choose your file . Pov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ inc .
opens a file . in the default file dialog you can select a file that you have previously made with &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ;
&quot; whenever you open a new model or create , the file will be inserted in this sub@@ menu and replace the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it is stored by the same name . it is a new file , you need to enter a name and space . &quot;
represents the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage will be rejected .
you can only choose this menu entry you can only choose if you have not saved changes in the scene .
&quot; repeated the last back@@ ing command . these menu entry , you can only select if you have been used correctly . &quot;
&quot; saves the current window of window and opens up a dialog , in which you enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing order . &quot;
&quot; in this menu you will find options for setting up &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; , here you can change the look to the short@@ cut and the standard . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change or add new orders with this option for &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; -@@ commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up the tool@@ bar . you can add and remove it with this option tool symbols for &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er .
a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a way to ins@@ ect smo@@ e surfaces without need@@ ing any b@@ ump on the surface individually model@@ ing and without the geomet@@ rical form of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a dump map as well as for a text map .
basic bodies are simple geomet@@ rical shapes that you can use as a components : very complex 3D models are produced of do@@ zen or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then further processed to give them a realistic appearance .
a text map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel base , by application of an image file as colour ticket . &quot;
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable educational and web browser . the application has a file browser which can choose images to display .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files you can see with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the button return .
&quot; you can adjust if any picture is displayed in a separate window , or if all images will always use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are searching for a particular file , simply complete the first character of the filename window . then a small input field in the lower right corner . if a matching file name was found , the file is highlighted by g@@ aps from return or &amp; es@@ c ; &quot;
&quot; in the set @-@ up - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show , there are five cardboard cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the working method of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; Set in the two others , short commands for the display section and short commands for the display , the keyboard short@@ cut for the respective windows can be set . &quot;
&quot; this is selected , then the pictures are opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the ad surface is filled with the background color that you can continue down . default is not a full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; is this point activated , invites &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already the next picture in the folder , while you still choose the current picture . this reduces the delay when you choose the next picture and is particularly suitable for a slideshow . &quot;
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the ending the name of the last open folder . at the next start opens &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the Brow@@ ser@@ window .
&quot; click on the colored bars to fill a background color . this is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is bigger than the picture , is also filled here in the background with the selected color . &quot;
you can set &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; so set that only some of the file types are shown that the program can also represent .
&quot; with this option , this option will be enlarged to the full screen on the full screen . this option is swit@@ ched as default . &quot;
sets out whether the slideshow is to begin with the first image in the folder or with the selected picture .
the time span between the change of change in a slideshow . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ der or small arrows right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; the number of repeti@@ tions . this value is set to 0 , the slideshow will be repeated until they enter the user . to change the value , you can use a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ ders right next to the input field . the default is 1 . &quot;
change the keyboard short@@ cut for the different modes of sub@@ types of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the map @-@ cards short@@ cuts for the display window and short commands for the browser .
&quot; with this option , you can switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window . &quot;
displays large symbols for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short presentation .

&quot; by the button Settings , the In@@ ge dialog will be opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the image if desired , in front of the memory . in this case the option is to be displayed on a preview . if this preview of the user is not desired , then the option must be chosen . &quot;
this setting allows them to select the type such as &amp; sk@@ an@@ ite ; images can open the dialog for each image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; this automatically saved with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must select Save without asking for a filename . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where images are stored on the option to be saved without a filename . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder will be used as standard for dialog to memory . the default value is your home directory and you can change it with the kno@@ b ... &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines a image fix for automatically saved images and is moreover , the proposed name for the image in dialog to save . the automatically stored by a num@@ eric Su@@ ff@@ ix which is stored automatically when a picture is saved . the string # # # will be replaced by the numbers . &quot;
&quot; the user can customize the image quality . this value is also changing the com@@ pression value on memory . if select image quality is not selected , then the default value is used by Q@@ t . &quot;
the kno@@ b aid starts the KDE assistance with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; -@@ manual . the button below starts the KDE labels for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; the button Settings can be used to finish &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite .
&quot; &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is licensed under the GPL and the lib@@ ks@@ ane library , used by &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; used under L@@ GPL . attention : li@@ bs@@ ane is licensed under the GPL with an exception . &quot;
&amp; AMAR@@ OK ; used like all other programs ke@@ we@@ zel . below you can set up a list of this pump@@ zel and their function . the global keyboard short@@ cut allows you to set up with the right mouse button in the Player window and select a set button in the player window and select a short mouse button ... select the button .
you may need to set existing multimedia buttons so that they work as a &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; -@@ short commands . this makes your keyboard to &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; -@@ check@@ up centre .
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general features which are mostly listed in other KDE programs . this section consists of six parts , and should describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browsers , player , playlist , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists and scripts . &quot;
AMAR@@ OK supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok still has some own command line options . &quot;
&quot; you should enter the user if the script should not be executed on a missing depen@@ dency . please check in your script , whether all the required modules are present and make use of dialog , so the user not running why a script does not run . &quot;
begin &apos; basket Lo@@ ad@@ dum &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Cor@@ un@@ dum ( KDE binding for ru@@ by ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos;@@ k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit end
&quot; in the folder of scripts , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a basis for your own scripts . you can quickly find the required functions . you will quickly find that the writing of scripts is relatively simple . &quot;
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P your scripts can share your scripts and Amar@@ ok . the easi@@ est way is the use of the command d@@ co@@ p ; what each KDE installation should be attached .
&quot; most scrip@@ ting languages allow the output of external programmes and commands . this usually , the function of Ex@@ ec . this way can usually be called d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively easy . here is an example in Python : &quot;
&quot; &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; sending notifications to all ongoing scripts . for this reason , scripts should monitor their default task and react accordingly to events . of course , a script may ignore the events even if there is no use for it . &quot;
configure the script to view the setup dialog . to display the stor@@ ing and loading of the setup data . if a script should be started , Amar@@ ok the working folder on the folder where all the data should be stored . &quot;
&quot; track@@ change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is played . the script could now ask &amp; z@@ B ; with D@@ CO@@ P , more information about the new piece ( for example the met@@ ad@@ ata or the quantity ) . &quot;
vol@@ um@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume sign@@ alized a change of volume . the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100 .
&quot; custom@@ ary Men@@ u@@ cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu of the Tit@@ le , Inclu@@ ded the path to the selected files of the playlist , you can also use the D@@ CO@@ P function d@@ co@@ p AMAR@@ OK script add@@ Custom@@ u@@ Item ( sub@@ menu item@@ le ) , you can use the D@@ CO@@ P function d@@ co@@ p AMAR@@ OK script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Item ( sub@@ menu item@@ le ) . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; it ends , or if the user stops a script , sends &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed so e.g. the memory of data or configuration settings . &quot;
Amar@@ oks script and administration can also install script packages that can be downloaded by a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar @-@ Archive ( .t@@ ar ) which can be op@@ ted with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .b@@ z@@ 2 ) that the user can also be recognized with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .b@@ z@@ 2 ) that the user can recognize the archive clearly as Amar@@ ok script .
&amp; AMAR@@ OK ; 1.3 will accept only script packages with the Re@@ pl@@ ung@@ ing amar@@ oc@@ script . for this reason you should ren@@ ame your script packages immediately .
&quot; the main cri@@ pts must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining to loading modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameters -@@ p to get the file right : &quot;
if your script is ready you can stop it on www.k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.org and click the link to the wiki script page of &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category AMAR@@ OK ; script .
&amp; AMAR@@ OK ; is a audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; has many useful and powerful functions and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; AMAR@@ OK , you can simply drag music into playlist instead of getting through endless menus . perhaps you are looking for just a very particular song from Mill@@ er in your collection . with &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; &apos; s Sam@@ ml@@ ungs @-@ Browser and the destination you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you have already decide some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists is still hard for you . and if you decide the decision still hard to choose the dynamic mode and the intelligent play@@ lists automatically after certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; AMAR@@ OK has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many general USB devices . furthermore , many different audio systems can be utili@@ zed so that SI@@ E can look for the most advanced audio player . AMAR@@ OK is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to experience your music ! &quot;
&quot; usually one has to enter in the base folder of Amar@@ ok sources , to compile and install Amar@@ ok and install : &quot;
&quot; da &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not compile when compil@@ ing no difficulties . if you encounter problems , please report it in the &amp; k@@ de ; mail@@ ing@@ lists . &quot;
&amp; AMAR@@ OK ; has like most applications such as some options that can activate or dis@@ able to dis@@ able the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the compil@@ ing options must be fulfilled certain depen@@ dencies so that they can be used . details can be found in the section system requirements .
activ@@ ating deb@@ ug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in the development of &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; you should use full . &quot;
&amp; AMAR@@ OK ; can be set up without effort on the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several boxes for the set @-@ up of the various functions of &amp; AMAR@@ OK ;
&quot; player window display the player window in addition to playlist a respectively . if the option is off , only the play@@ lists will be sh@@ aded window ) . &quot;
&quot; voting bar@@ ometer use : this function is only available , if &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; with support for m@@ ood@@ le compiled . the option enables the experim@@ ental function of the voting @-@ bar@@ ometer . &quot;
&quot; full of design : this function is only available , if &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; with support for m@@ ood@@ le compiled . this is the used color scheme for the voting bar@@ ometer . &quot;
voting files at the music files : this function is only available if &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; with support for m@@ ood@@ le compiled . otherwise the .m@@ ood files are stored in the Settings folder of &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; ( usually ~ / .k@@ en / share / apps / AMAR@@ OK / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
&quot; external browser : lets you choose which browser will be started by &amp; AMAR@@ OK , if a browser is needed . &quot;
&quot; other browsers are using : here you can indicate the path to another browser which is not in the list about it . &quot;
playlist when you save the current playlist automatically save the current playlist by &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; activate this option if you do not want to lose the current playlist at the end .
&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , is &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the memory location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files are stored . &quot;
up @-@ to @-@ up piece can be visible in the piece of change that the play@@ lists can be up / down @-@ up window to keep the current piece always in the visible window of the window .
&quot; in the piece of change to the context @-@ Browser shows automatically the context @-@ browser , once the next piece is played . &quot;
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance you can customize &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; the section is divided into three parts .
&quot; in the fonts section , you can use the use of different writ@@ ings in &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; the otherwise selected section is activated . you can choose writ@@ ings for the following area : playback window , players window and context @-@ browser . press views ... , so you can choose a desired font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of user defined color scheme , you even have the qu@@ al of choice and can set your own color scheme . use them including the activation of the activation and background color . &quot;
&quot; you can continue playing at the start that &amp; AMAR@@ OK , after the program start playing the playback automatically with the piece in the place . &quot;
the under@@ window On @-@ screen display will enable you to use the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display will be attached to preview the O@@ SD and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview .
&quot; the first option is the font . click to select ... to select from the dialog you want to select the desired font for the O@@ SD . the an@@ kreu@@ z@@ feld shade causes the text in the O@@ SD sh@@ aded . &quot;
&quot; own colors will use you the possibility to adjust the O@@ SD colors for font and background . a click on the color range opens the dialog to colour sel@@ ections . if the color is not activated , the default &amp; k@@ de ; colours are used . &quot;
the text@@ field display text displays the text shown in the O@@ SD . by type of placement can be adapted to the own needs . below you will find a list of available wild@@ card and what they mean .
the option screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to define on which screen of a multi @-@ clock monitor the O@@ SD will appear .
the card @-@ card Audio output can select a audio driver from the selection field . some drivers enable further adjustment possibilities in this box card .
the card card collection is used for set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and the type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , search the &amp; AMAR@@ OK &apos; to music files . to insert a folder into the collection , select the cross @-@ line box next to its name . this section contains an cruci@@ fix@@ ture , as well as with the selected folders . &quot;
sub@@ folders and browse these : this brings that &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; both the crossed as well as their sub@@ folders to music .
&quot; alter@@ ation : allows &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; to monitor the selected folder to changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) , an incre@@ mental search will make it possible to make the necessary changes in your collection . &quot;
play@@ lists can import : that &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; all ti@@ pped play@@ lists in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection then appear later in the play@@ lists .
the part of semen data base is used to choose a database for the collection . the Com@@ bin@@ ations Drivers : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ ql . if My@@ S@@ ql is selected is still further equipment in the under@@ window My@@ S@@ ql institution .
&quot; the My@@ S@@ ql institution is to set up the database for &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; then the calcul@@ ator will be used to which the My@@ S@@ ql database is inserted , under which the database is available . name : is the database name to which the connection is made . &quot;
use : and password : enter the data required for connection to the database .
the map @-@ card last@@ .@@ fm does the support for last@@ .@@ fm A . &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; can transmit the names of pointed pieces to a last@@ .@@ fm server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece .
&quot; here you give your username and password for your last@@ .@@ fm profile . if you have no profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ fm website . &quot;
&quot; send pieces and send the profile : this setting allows it &amp; AMAR@@ OK , the names of the pointed pieces to your last@@ .@@ fm profile . &quot;
similar interpre@@ ters call : after activation of this setting is a list with similar interpre@@ ters . you can see the list in the context browser . note : they do not need a last@@ .@@ fm profile to use this feature .
&amp; AMAR@@ OK ; is a audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ B ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
&quot; AMAR@@ OK only needs the K@@ deli@@ bs , and otherwise no other KDE packages . you have to install K@@ deli@@ bs ( including those contained the programs , because &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; requires some of them , for example modules or scripts ) . we have a small guide written how to compile K@@ deli@@ bs minimal . &quot;
&quot; some features such as the O@@ SD set ahead that your window manager will continue to support the relevant standards of ess@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . we try to support AMAR@@ OK on all platforms , so we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because they are willing to provide excellent development environment . &quot;
&quot; probably , one of your files will bring an error in the t@@ agli@@ b library . you can check the file to the t@@ agli@@ b / share / apps / AMAR@@ OK / bank _ scan@@ .@@ log . after that you can delete the file and make the collection again . &quot;
mostly lies that t@@ agli@@ b in reading the Meta information from this file . please report this error to the t@@ agli@@ b developers under bu@@ gs.@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , then try SQ@@ Lite . the support for it in &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; is somewhat more mature . &quot;
&quot; make sure that all of &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; used libraries have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if such as &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; with GCC 3.4 , t@@ agli@@ b but with GCC 3.@@ 3.@@ x compiled , then this leads to over@@ throw from Meta @-@ information . &quot;
&quot; if you use KDE with art@@ s@@ d then dis@@ able to turn off on , if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or do not use at least one value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ seat by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens at a crash ) , and send us a good impression , the error will be guaranteed . &quot;
&quot; this is because that many program writes data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 into Meta @-@ information , but not identi@@ fies it as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script does not en@@ counter@@ ed the problem . &quot;
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ AR@@ G@@ V &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ - &gt; new ( $ AR@@ G@@ V &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ day = $ MP@@ 3@@ - &gt; new ( $ AR@@ G@@ V &#91; 0 &#93; \ &apos; unless $ MP@@ 3@@ - &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ day ( $ v@@ 2@@ day , amp ; I ) ; &quot;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PAN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&quot; &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; s symbols in the stat@@ bar ( random panel / repeti@@ tion ) see in KDE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , you can correct the tool@@ box in KDE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes you can click in the Control Center under appearance and semi @-@ transparent . note that in some cases you have to click on a icon until this setting shows their effect . &quot;
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : in@@ ao symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then please check whether AMAR@@ OK the correct Q@@ t library . this can be found with ld@@ d &apos;@@ f@@ amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p Q@@ t . &quot;
&quot; to fix these errors , you possibly need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that AMAR@@ OK the right version first find . &quot;
there are some possibilities . most installations are clear by the help of an expert of your Uni@@ x@@ - or Linux distribution . they can also use help with other users or in the developers . they can also use the forum and IR@@ C below ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ eno@@ de@@ .net in the channel # AMAR@@ OK .
&quot; Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter there only one mistake , if you have something at the removal of an error in AMAR@@ OK itself . &quot;
after the start of &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; appears just a blank playlist . how do music come here ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to keep the surface intuitive , the start of the under@@ window was converted into the statisti@@ c window . you can find it under extras statistics . &quot;
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are available for evalu@@ ating the user while the points will be automatically calculated .
&quot; to rate pieces , in the playlist the playlist , must be displayed in the playlist and choose column . click somewhere in the new application column . you can also use the short description of Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want to remove , and then click on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your choice and then select the playlist from the folding menu . &quot;
drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and let them fall there exactly as you would like to do it with other files . so easy it is : - )
&quot; in the tool@@ bar the playlist , right next to the Add @-@ button , the button will save the playlist . click on it . &quot;
probably you missing the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config . install the package x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; new . look even after lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations . &quot;
the Equ@@ alizer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . furthermore you can find it via the menu bar under Extr@@ as Equ@@ alizer ....
&quot; no . yes , this is true ! none ! &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; used one of the back@@ end independent approach , therefore , the real question of de@@ af / X@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support so pretty every only concei@@ vable audio format . G@@ Stream@@ er can even support text and PNG transparent ! &quot;
&quot; it can ! maybe use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , what are not delivered in the default setting ( from pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : old @-@ F2 , g@@ g : Red@@ hat mp3 k@@ de , input . &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; playing MP3 &apos;s off : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ Stream@@ er driver with the al@@ sa @-@ S@@ ink , the device needs to use a bl@@ ender . a mix@@ er allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix -@@ module for al@@ sa ( Software @-@ Mix@@ er ) . check out the support D@@ mix for AL@@ SA . &quot;
the output of this command should help you to search for the problem of problems and a solution . for G@@ Stream@@ er you may need a different ink ( such as os@@ s@@ giving ) .
&quot; this does &amp; AMAR@@ OK , already . do not forget that media first you need to be de@@ coded . G@@ Stream@@ er reads the file , if you read a decade or with little over@@ head . G@@ Stream@@ er reads the file , de@@ coded and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ coding the data first . G@@ Stream@@ er can be directly to AL@@ SA exactly as well as X@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stream@@ er driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open sound server with highest possible priority ( real time ) and increase the size of sound @-@ buffer ( warning ) see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ ap@@ per SU@@ ID is set :
&quot; with KDE 3.@@ 2.@@ x , there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia co@@ de@@ cs to do so . read this error report . read the magni@@ fier of the sound @-@ Pu@@ ff@@ ers in your AL@@ SA @-@ up @-@ file .@@ gra@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well . &quot;
&quot; either do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stream@@ er or X@@ ine , or install KDE @-@ Multimedia completely to get the quick@@ er Arts co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ er.@@ so &amp; etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; probably use the Arts drivers . use another driver ( the X@@ ine @-@ driver was optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts buff@@ ers in the control center and sound &amp; Multimedia , sound system . the less the buffer , the less returns , please help us to fix it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stream@@ er is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stream@@ er driver , cr@@ ashes &amp; AMAR@@ OK . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stream@@ er you must register all components . run it , to register all G@@ Stream@@ er components . &quot;
read the G@@ Stream@@ er FAQ . if that does not help you can also ask at IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( termin@@ ate AMAR@@ OK before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg compile and install it . then run it into the module folder of G@@ Stream@@ er all ff@@ m@@ peg @-@ files ( you will find the module folder with g@@ st @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run g@@ st register again . start now &amp; AMAR@@ OK .
&quot; please report on you at bu@@ kt@@ k@@ o.@@ org@@ . if you have a full list of suggestions / requests , please send them best to our mail@@ ing list : AMAR@@ OK @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ source@@ forge@@ .net . &quot;
&amp; AMAR@@ OK ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I really like it and find that the name sounds well . besides the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P that is already possible . put an alarm on your calendar program and run it with the alarm on this command : d@@ co@@ p AMAR@@ OK player play
&quot; this command lets &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; the playback start . make sure that &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; run before you go to bed , then you will be raised by the rolling k@@ id of the music that you have stopped before bed . &quot;
how can we know the title in &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; if you &apos;re on another computer ?
if a functional SSH environment is present you can proceed as follows . this command gives you interpre@@ t and title of the current piece of : SSH -@@ I ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ used _ AMAR@@ OK player now@@ Play@@ ing
replace IP address with your IP and your username . this is pres@@ upp@@ oses that your identification is in the file ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa .
visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; AMAR@@ OK &apos; window . press the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size changing window . &quot;
the combination of Str@@ g + rights mouse button places a piece in the cli@@ ck@@ long@@ ing result in queue for a search in the playlist for a search in the playlist will be played the first back result and search the search .
&quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ cky functions , but how does it look with the icon in the system @-@ section of the control bar ? &quot;
click with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; click on the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browsers are to be displayed .
my personal folder $ HOME is located on a NFS drive . after the start of AMAR@@ OK the collection database can not be created and on the console appear many messages . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite @-@ database by &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; does not work with NFS . either you need ~ / .k@@ en / share / apps / AMAR@@ OK to a local drive or use amar@@ o@@ K@@ s MySQL support .
&quot; insert the CD , then click the menu on Audio @-@ CD . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . to normal read it into the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them into the desired destination folder in a con@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic enco@@ ding instead take files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g . &quot;

&quot; basically , this will find the previous assessment with a di@@ min@@ ishing value based on how often the play was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence has every single rating based on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can edit the evaluation for a piece of yourself by clicking the right mouse button in the play@@ lists in the play@@ lists in the play@@ lists in the play@@ lists , namely , by clicking on the piece and editing : evaluate or F2 . you can edit the evaluation also in the dialog met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; the developers do not want to post you , when you want to post a stable version of AMAR@@ OK . this means &quot; KDE packages have a fixed release plan of the un@@ specified plan of AMAR@@ OK . &quot;
&quot; this is a new function in AMAR@@ OK , which some users can be able to find also ner@@ vi@@ g . de@@ activate the option symbol in playback , in general settings . &quot;
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select the tool@@ bar settings ... and take the desired changes there .
&quot; Download a design , or create your own . install this then under AMAR@@ OK setup ... appearance context @-@ Browser design , click New design .... &quot;
&quot; the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( elf@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) too much . to avoid difficulties , it was removed . &quot;

&quot; if you would like to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest versions . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of abstr@@ acts and therefore caused a lot of troub@@ les . &quot;
probably &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; compile before you have installed X@@ ine or g@@ low@@ amer . therefore the / configure routine are not compile and install &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; new to configure and install .
&quot; now I have &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; new installed , but the output emo@@ des still does not appear . and now ? &quot;
&quot; pres@@ um@@ ably use a distribution which installed the development files apart from the actual program . although G@@ Stream@@ er is installed , you need to install X@@ ine de@@ vel . you need to re@@ compile X@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you need to compile and install again re@@ compile and install again . &quot;
I get the mistake G@@ Stream@@ er @-@ Cri@@ tical * * : factory for &apos; ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stream@@ er was compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking . you have to compile G@@ Stream@@ er without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : users do not compile LD@@ FLA@@ GS when you compil@@ ing AMAR@@ OK .
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp4 although the module g@@ low@@ amer are installed .

&quot; burning a previously made DVD photo . the dialog ask for a * .@@ is@@ o file as data source , which then can be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; a previously released DVD video can be converted . this dialog box will usually be used after reading a DVD in the Ingredients page , however , it contains information about the outs@@ ourc@@ ed video , enco@@ ding settings and even possibilities for modi@@ fying the size and to cut black belts . &quot;

shows a list of the tool@@ bar by &amp; k@@ 3@@ b . if an entry is crossed out is the tool@@ bar currently visible in the main window .
&quot; if this is crossed , a small body is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the stat@@ us@@ bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; out@@ dated the folder view or off . the folder view contains an overview of your folder and the CD / DVD drives . if the content is activated , the content is displayed in the Ingredients page . CD / DVD drives also have an context menu with functions such as media info , locks and un@@ lock the disk or throw of the medium . &quot;
&quot; out@@ dated the content , or from . the ingredients will enable you to choose and draw files into the project view . the ingredients is also the interface to read from audio or video CDs , provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD in folder view . &quot;
&quot; out@@ dated the head@@ line in the project view or off . the header is a narrow area that contains only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head bar has no real function , it only looks pretty and separ@@ ates the project view clearly from the remaining views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialogue window to change the key@@ boards for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after one has chosen one of the available commands in the upper part , one can adapt the keyboard order below . &quot;
&quot; this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; furnish@@ ing assist@@ ants . with this , the correct auth@@ en@@ ers to Burn CDs and DVDs are required . therefore , you need to enter the wiz@@ ard rights , so you must enter the password for the system manager ( root ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b . here , general programs can be made . nearly all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should be working on an@@ hi@@ eb . this dialog is meant to person@@ alize and intended for the tuning of the program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many others &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface also equipped with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality allows for example via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; features functions , you can either use the command line utility d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are crucial in the functional category , therefore rather your taste and the type of your task is crucial that the con@@ den@@ sing programs can give you den@@ si@@ zing . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we take that you can use the command line utility d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; you need to make use previously that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b . then enter something like the following one : &quot;
&quot; besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; features , all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program gem@@ stones , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts that are described below . &quot;
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface between &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; features functions such as copy@@ CD , format@@ ters and other functions for the creation of new projects . &quot;
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref _ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Audio@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Adv@@ oc@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref _ ate@@ Adv@@ oc@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref _ ate@@ Adv@@ e@@ C@@ dr@@ w ( ) void of D@@ v@@ d ( ) void of D@@ v@@ d ( ) void of D@@ v@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ dr@@ w ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ dr@@ w ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , one gets a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly developed project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ ref ( k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project receive a # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ interface curr@@ ent@@ Project D@@ urch Ver@@ using this reference is it possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface is applicable on data ( CD and DVD ) :

&quot; for example , it is possible to fill out a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then add files into the new folder : &quot;

&amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; is a audio CD ; -@@ for@@ read@@ er for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it all can be read audio @-@ CD ; s can be read and stored in MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible depending on the En@@ coder is installed on your computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; is the user interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for the reading of &amp; CD ; data stored in WAV files on the hard disk ) and from many enco@@ ders to be installed ( com@@ press packages ) . further co@@ di@@ sers can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
&quot; first , the titles of the &amp; CD will be read and saved in WAV files on the computer ( for@@ ged and com@@ pressed ) ; and then &quot;
in a second step these WAV files ( usually one per title ) com@@ pressed into the MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG format or other formats such as the lu@@ st@@ free FL@@ AC .
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is compiled by &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . nearly every distribution has compiled a pre@@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , it must now be done . &quot;
&quot; for the second step you need to be installed ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ s ( for O@@ GG ) or other co@@ di@@ sers . all these programs are already installed on any Linux distribu@@ tions . however , but only the co@@ di@@ sers will not be used to compile it . if the example FL@@ AC is not used , whose installation is also not required . &quot;
which co@@ b@@ er- / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ sers gives a small introduction to co@@ di@@ sers , audio quality and com@@ pression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word to the copying of protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the protection of audio data from the &amp; CD ; it is not possible to handle any copy protection , it is not possible to handle a protected audio CD ; it is not possible to handle a protected audio CD ; just avoid the mechanisms of your copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while the set @-@ up only has to be done ( the setup dialog , but it can be called up until a suitable configuration has been found ) , will be explained in the daily handling of a &amp; CD ; on the hard drive . this leads to the understanding of the slim approach of the user interface , which you can frequently st@@ um@@ bled at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert in many formats - depending on which co@@ di@@ sers are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FL@@ AC &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB from the Internet or can work completely without network , whereby all manual is recorded manually . &quot;
&quot; this is just a short list of the commands of the main window . on the side step by step example , find out more information about how this program is used as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of regi@@ sters for configuration of the program . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ DB request of the CD @-@ data according to the installation of request in the CD@@ DB . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case the connection must first be established first . ) &quot;
start reading and - if a En@@ coder is configured in the user &apos;s enco@@ ding settings in the set up - the coding .
&quot; opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available En@@ coder , so that the selection can be read with a different En@@ coder than the standard . it is to be noted that previously the En@@ coder is configured in the user &apos;s code settings in the setup dialog . &quot;
opens the file manager so that an already installed file is selected instead of a full &amp; CD ; upgrade and enco@@ ding .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notifications ( like prot@@ ocol@@ s , Pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for programming languages ( like reading the &amp; CD ; ends ) . &quot;
opens the main function dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; with different card cards ( like En@@ coder to set up the En@@ co@@ ders ) . here you have to go before the program can be successful !
&quot; this chapter describes audio quality , co@@ di@@ sers and com@@ pres@@ sion@@ ds and helps you to choose the right body . &quot;
&quot; if no audio is to go lost , an loss@@ less audio format is required . besides FL@@ AC , there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; Mon@@ key &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low com@@ pres@@ sion@@ ates and hardly available commercial devices that can restore these files . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats , the information generated by data com@@ pression depending on their psych@@ o@@ ak@@ usti@@ ble model , MP3 and O@@ GG have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower Bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above these bit@@ rate the differences are less important , since both co@@ di@@ sers can produce very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; o &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame will still be delivered for free with the majority of distribu@@ tions , but there are open license questions &quot;
&quot; + high to very high level of sound quality ( with high bit@@ rates ) , but compared with O@@ GG slightly deeper quality in deeper bit@@ ters . &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from one machine or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG feature is available .
&quot; MP3 - if music is also heard on other devices , like standard DVD player , portable equipment ( USB stick , memory card ) or special car stereo . today - initially 2009 - support these devices mostly only the MP3 format . &quot;
a brief list of parameters for audio quality and out from resulting com@@ pres@@ sion@@ ates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = this setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = this setting should usually offer transparency for most people and most of the musicians , and has already quite high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stere@@ ograms with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , com@@ pression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps CB@@ R , com@@ pression rate about 5.5 . always needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a titles . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps CB@@ R common stereo , com@@ pression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a Tit@@ le . good enough for music of young people , portable equipment and car facilities . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi stereo . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et Ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps CB@@ R . this setting will be excessive for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size , then choose this attitude . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information that are manually entered or by the program automatically collected from the free@@ DB over the Internet , are available as a list of parameters . they can be passed / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; and the enco@@ ding program to generate the folder and file names , as well as the properties of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with enco@@ ding programs , there is often a combination of programs for the Ko@@ di@@ sers and these parameters here . the manual or the help of the enco@@ ding explain the switch for these programs . &quot;
e.g. to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keyword ( English : day ) add MP@@ 3@@ s with l@@ ame must be added to the switch -@@ tt of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; the result looks like : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; parameters can be used ( = button design@@ ation in assist@@ ants ) :
&quot; this is what the free@@ DB is : a free database , in which people can download the audio CD to enter the information , so that all the other information can be downloaded in the computer . it &apos;s to note that here only from text is saved into the computer : &amp; CD ; title , artist , names of pieces &amp; etc ; , not of the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( Anatomy of the U@@ eber@@ er ) am not an attorney . however , no one may prevent you from the &amp; CD ; more or less valuable , so you can neither be attri@@ buted to the artist nor the music ; more or less valuable , so , all information can be attri@@ buted to a B@@ um@@ mel by a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtu@@ alizer . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; is active a sign @-@ in case ( S@@ ending an address ) . for the use of free@@ DB can be used with another ( found ) , in this type of configuration , so it appears , the e @-@ mail address will not be used to retri@@ eve the data from the server ( This is only the programmer know which the code has been veri@@ fied . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; for the use of free@@ DB is to be used , the geograph@@ ically on the next lying mirror server is needed . this saves band@@ width in the network and is similar to the load between the b@@ ills . &quot;
&quot; a visit to ess@@ ily analysis provides a current list of Spiegel@@ servers for the online @-@ call of &amp; CD ; information during the reading of a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( typically monthly ) only the updates of the database . &quot;
which output program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files to my computer ?
&quot; there is sm@@ ells that cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more accurately , looking at source code .... This was always the best choice for the reading of audio CD ; s. for note that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package has to be installed on the appropriate distribution , if this has not yet happened . &quot;
&quot; to store the outs@@ ourc@@ ed WAV files can be chosen by the Ko@@ di@@ sers , and thus the desired file format . at the first opening there are pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ G@@ s ) and FL@@ AC ( a di@@ lu@@ st@@ free com@@ pression for audio data ) on the setup of the enco@@ ding . other co@@ di@@ sers can be added on this tab . &quot;
the co@@ di@@ er package must be installed by the respective Linux distribution before the co@@ di@@ sers can be used . for more information about Ko@@ di@@ sers are available in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ sers .
after installation of a enco@@ ding you can get more information on his switch by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a con@@ sol@@ le window ( eg ; con@@ ame &apos; will be replaced by the name of the installed enco@@ ding .
&quot; this can have many causes . check the setup of the device drawing of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drives , and if both cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia as well as the audio @-@ co@@ di@@ sers of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , FL@@ AC &amp; etc ; ) are installed . try to give both programs with a command line in a terminal . this could give a reference to what is wrong . &quot;
check if you do not want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check the gro@@ mm@@ et of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is one chapter with one step for step example . even if you use other settings , these tips can give us how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , everything understood , but somehow still un@@ sure what to do is ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will launch the program for the first time , all set up and our first &amp; CD ; we &apos;ll be l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; using MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 keyword ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; there must be cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution , as it is not necessary to compile the source files that you can always do so . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you have scre@@ ened to it ( eg ; by trying to copy a little with the con@@ quer@@ or .
the first section covers the basic set of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; something probably done only once and
the second section describes the procedure to read a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each output &amp; CD ;
&quot; here we determine the co@@ di@@ sers to com@@ pression of music ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 up to 256 k@@ bps ) . it is intended to use the files and which structure is used to use the free@@ DB to download the &amp; CD , data from the Internet . &quot;
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will likely not make it very likely to read a &amp; CD ; if once you find the appropriate settings . &quot;
device drawing is handed over to the read@@ out program so that the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces can be read .
&quot; frequently , / dev / c@@ dro@@ m is a symbo@@ lic link to the actual device drawing of your disk . if this is not working or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is also available , the device can also be accessed via the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device records for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the card @-@ card General settings . here is not much to do . here , an additional transformation can be defined . in our example everything will be done so up@@ wards as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; only if you want to ask for complete information , so you will be informed if information on the creation of keywords ( tags ) are missing . &quot;
the card card CD ; settings . simply both entries select . we are comfortable and release the &amp; CD ; data automatically downloaded over the Internet from a free@@ DB computer .
note : the calcul@@ ator must be connected during the reading of the &amp; CD ; with the Internet to access the free@@ DB server so that he can access the free@@ DB server .
&quot; the second selection field is sim@@ pler , a &amp; CD ; entry starts immediately after reading the &amp; CD ; this is slightly dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and it will be easily changed . the directory or filename entries can be easily changed and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example is further to note : if you do not want to manually enter the selection of the fields and free@@ DB , if you &apos;re using the database before download . however , these more than 620 MB large , consider these two sel@@ ections will be selected at least the first . the mode will be selected at the following map card . &quot;
CD@@ DB is for us free@@ DB . these are settings for the data request for the retri@@ ev@@ ing the &amp; CD ; information about the free@@ DB @-@ server via the Internet . how does the system to get data the CD ? read the section about free@@ DB . continue everything as it is shown in the screen@@ shot .
&quot; mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet . &quot;
CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to the side@@ ways and look after a mirror server in your vicinity . on this road the burden of b@@ ills is distributed as a first attempt .
&quot; both are both working as the server , as many fire@@ walls decre@@ ases 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more fortun@@ ate with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to surf the Internet . &quot;
in this example we do not want to dis@@ able any &amp; CD ; data to the free@@ DB server . the first attack should be dis@@ able .
simply take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure that the folder / tmp on your computer exists )
&quot; quantity simultaneously out@@ lined pieces : sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the same time when using existing drive ? parall@@ el@@ es read and co@@ ding ? the author knows it not , therefore simply try . &quot;
CD ; after reading of the last piece : cross this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
&quot; user custom folder for temporary files , then you may need to be stored in the path / folder , where the WAV files can be stored in which the WAV files are created . do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files . &quot;
&quot; all to enter as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is somewhat long , under circumstances something must be lying down to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is an attitude for very good audio quality , even for very good Hi@@ Fi stereo . the com@@ pression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the restriction of generating tags to Version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if necessary change the tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input data ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest like in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
&quot; number of simultaneously to co@@ di@@ able WAV files : with a Dual@@ Core or Quad@@ core , or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried , more than an WAV file at the same time . &quot;
&quot; this is , we have just finished the basic establishment of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; this configuration is used as standard for each out@@ reading a &amp; CD ; use . if you have chosen the organisation structure of your music , you don &apos;t need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; this section is described as the process of reading the &amp; CD ; on the hard disk , we will create MP3 files , as we are installed in the previous section , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data of the free@@ DB is to be described in the previous section , the process of which is described in this section must be repeated for each full &amp; CD ; &quot;
&quot; since we use a &amp; CD ; use which is not included in the free@@ DB , see the screen@@ shots a little different from those for a &amp; CD ; with successful from free@@ DB ab@@ sent data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually , instead of providing them out of the Internet . comments will refer to the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this hand@@ book .
&quot; if this is not yet done , the &amp; CD will now have to be defined in the main window , which was defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as shown in the screen@@ shot . this only when the &amp; CD ; can be identified , and can be identified by cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this does not happen , then you are looking for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD was fet@@ ched successfully from the free@@ DB , all the titles of the pieces are already filled and moreover , the name of the artist and the album are displayed . &quot;
&quot; for the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window appears , and you can select the database entry containing what your opinion best to your &amp; CD ; &quot;
&quot; if you do not have the cross @-@ panel for the automatic query of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually trigger it by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you do not have a local database , but transfer the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - input the CD @-@ Data and the Tit@@ le of the first piece
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen@@ shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Update &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the artist does not have to be entered into the input field &apos; Updated title &apos; , unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece . &quot;
&quot; the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments of ini@@ di@@ so@@ ell per piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply to all the pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the free@@ DB is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD Edi@@ tors . however , it is always a good idea to begin with the artist and album names ( such as all words with big letters , or not ... ) , but also to consider whether there are any un@@ wanted comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limited the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the commentary box . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . this option will be set up on the tab @-@ tab ; take a look at the code settings . &quot;
&quot; you can change the day information of the generated files later with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot;
tags will not be supported by all Ko@@ da@@ ers or fil@@ form@@ ers . see the help of the co@@ di@@ er to find more information .
simply select an entry that obviously doesn &apos;t match the style of the track@@ ed CD ; this example is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; -@@ Data is not transfer . for more information go to the Internet page . pop or R@@ ap for example are to be found at Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; return to the main window . click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD editing will be back and you will see that the fields are recorded for the album already recorded with the entered data . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . simply enter the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed to the same way until you have given all the front data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window will not appear if you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are shown above the list .
note that it has a check @-@ character before each line of a piece of piece . only the title that are highlighted are marked . a simple click on the line ob@@ sol@@ ete the selection of the piece or off . make sure you select all the pieces select at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces on one time .
&quot; was started by clicking on the button select the exhau@@ st process , then this window appears to confirmation . click OK and then we will look at the window with the orders and track what runs . &quot;
&quot; click on the tab orders to switch on the order window . it is in the left half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is displayed on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the upper left part of the window .
this error message will see if you are trying to work with a co@@ di@@ sers you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully coded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the tmp file and the destination are not what we have entered here in example . have you checked whether you have access to the folder for the temporary files and the target folder ? ; - ) &quot;
&quot; now it is clear , why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; the order 1 reads the first piece of , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of piece 1 to format MP3 . therefore , please read and coded in parallel . note the status review in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has no configuration settings to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that is configur@@ able , the result is un@@ clear . the machine is un@@ clear . the machine used with an AM@@ D@@ 64 does not seem to read and enco@@ ding ( from however two different pieces ) . &quot;
&quot; now the last title will be read , while another piece is coded and a third order in the queue of the body . after the last piece is coded , a small window will be built with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . respectively 4.@@ x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate com@@ pressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the co@@ di@@ er of your choice . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; is maintained today within the &amp; k@@ de , CV@@ S as part of the k@@ iller @-@ package . however , you can already install an anonymous copy , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is already a pre @-@ compiled package . if you &apos;re reading this , you have probably done it already done ... &quot;
&quot; this section is directed to individuals who compiled by source files , and not intended for users who have a pre@@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help as the program can be adapted to your needs , then the following is right for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls for many different programs , has many variations of settings . best read the step for step example to get to know the options and settings . it displays scre@@ aming of different boxes of the settings and also contains comments for options that may not be used in the example . &quot;
&quot; hello , still am reading ? even if only the help menu after the first stroke of the program was cli@@ cked , without any clu@@ e like it should go from this somehow empty screen ( especially when it is at the time of the program , no audio CD ; in drive ) , or from un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
what does it go ? who reads this has probably started the program . it should look something like this :
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author cannot be stopped . it &apos;s as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; however , who also always do something us@@ eful@@ ness or change it . at least only after contact with the author . and if you read this , he has taken this section and is therefore agreed with this proposal . &quot;
&quot; strange when it has managed to pick up the source file of the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ u@@ er of &amp; k@@ de ; . besides others he did not have some properties , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players have not . &quot;
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it is installed on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ de ; support also on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ al@@ location ; al@@ sa is included as soon as it is supported a sequence .
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the monitor with altern@@ ating color , so it is easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by raising the pressed buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
Dra@@ g &amp; Drop so that you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; every MIDI file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window on KM@@ id .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( song@@ writing or tex@@ til ) . KM@@ id will automatically calculate the used processes .
&quot; support support . if you stop &amp; k@@ de ; during the break of a song , KM@@ id will start again with the same song again . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI @-@ syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and CIS -@@ cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P drives and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can choose opening ... from the menu File . it appears the usual file dialog with which you can choose the desired song . &quot;
you can also drop a file of a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ windows drop . this works also with several songs at the same time .
&quot; to open a piece of music , open it and pra@@ ying the button play in the tool@@ bar , select the entry from the menu piece , or put the Le@@ ading frame . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece automatically starts , once you draw it on the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ windows . ( in several pieces , they are added to a collection and then played in each other . ) &quot;
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece happens , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the reg@@ ler and forth . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows left and right of the Tem@@ plat@@ display . to get back the original pace , double click the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the Spac@@ eb@@ ar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the button break or the selecting the menu entry into the menu piece , i.e. the playback . pra@@ yed for play , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; the playback . &quot;
&quot; lyrics can be stored on two species in a piece of music . some pieces are using tex@@ tual , others use lyrics and again other both . some pieces have no text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can adjust which events are to be displayed and even better : the event sty@@ ling will automatically determine which you have nothing to adjust , so you have nothing to adjust the entry automatic text files , but you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set a event type set , select from the menu settings the entries Tex@@ ter@@ eig@@ ners or song@@ writers . the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you summar@@ ize . these will be played in line , in this section , how you can use collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to get a collection , open first the coll@@ ector manager . this can be found in the menu collection under the point of organiz@@ er .... Click on New and enter the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and select the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original .
&quot; if you have more than a collection , you can adjust the load in the collection manager . &quot;
the temporary collection go to all songs which you want to add to any other collection .
&quot; when leaving the application , this collection will not be saved . concern that when you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the button adding a song . it appears in turn the file dialog with which you can choose the desired song . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on the setting automatically Add to the collection .
&quot; when Automatic Ad@@ ding to the collection is activated , a piece in opening ( using file open or drag and drop ) automatically to the active collection . &quot;
&quot; when automatic add to the collection is not enabled , when opening a piece the temporary collection is activated and yellow . this collection will then be added to the open pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click on remo@@ ving . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order that are played in which the songs are played . if you select the number from the sub@@ menu , the songs in order , the songs are played in order as they have been added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add them or remove or remove or random order in the menu , the order will be new . &quot;
&quot; to add a song , choose it in the collection manager , or use the selection list over the kar@@ aoke text . &quot;
&quot; to jump a song further , select the kno@@ b &apos;s song , the record next song from the menu piece or press the arrow right . &quot;
&quot; to jump around a song back , select the button previous piece , the entry Previous piece of the menu piece or push the arrow arrows left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , choose the collection and click the button Del@@ ete . &quot;
the temporary collection can not be deleted . this does not play a role as it is not saved at the release of &amp; k@@ mid ; it is not saved .
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesizer , which are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events in events that understands the syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map which conver@@ ts all events of the Typ@@ s Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Typ@@ s Change patch to trumpet , and thus always a trumpet will be playing a piano . &quot;
&quot; if you only have a sound@@ card , you do not need MIDI Map because all Sound@@ cards are GM -@@ compatible ( incl . AW@@ E - and CIS -@@ cards , FM radio devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is no programs to create MIDI Maps . you need to edit the appropriate file from hand ( with your favorite actor ) . &quot;
a MIDI @-@ map is a text @-@ file that saves all required re@@ plac@@ ements to play a piece .
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which may appear as often as desired . prerequisite for this is however , that every occurr@@ ence has a different text box ( see below ) . &quot;
&quot; De@@ fine PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; &quot; EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; &quot; EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ ANN@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D options ... EN@@ D
&quot; you see that De@@ fine is needed , to indicate that a section starts ( except for options ) and EN@@ D that is achieved by the end of an average . &quot;
&quot; please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail , so that I can offer future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible . &quot;
in this section you will be specified as the patches of General MIDI to your specific keyboard . the general use looks as follows :
&quot; please note that the left side of the equ@@ ation is ignored . it is assumed that the GM -@@ patches are present in the right order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is needed to put all tones using the number M ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , you can take a d@@ rum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which can be similar to the PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section : &quot;
&quot; so now a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 ( gun allowance ) , it takes patch 100 ( the Drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here with the term d@@ rum patch the patch is meant , where every sound is a different percus@@ sion@@ sin@@ stru@@ ment ( Drum , basin , Marac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and does not have the one that means the clay level of the always same d@@ rum ( as it has some key@@ boards ) . &quot;
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is used to pass such as tones on a certain channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as with PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the sequence of lines is very important , as their availability . so you have to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define multiple key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you just need to use various names in the first line .
Key@@ maps are used mainly to sc@@ ored t@@ ints on the percus@@ sions . take a look at the supplied key@@ maps .
&quot; this section can be used to retri@@ eve some channels to others . if you want to switch off the first and second channel , you just make it in the CH@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a certain channel ( general MIDI to channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; Midi @-@ Devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ ANN@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , number@@ ed from 0 to 15 , constructed according to the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; n is the channel , which is installed on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the key@@ map should use the file name for this channel . if you are using the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored the patch on this channel . in this case , then always Patch x used . &quot;
the For@@ ce@@ Patch Option can be useful for example to always use the percus@@ sions patch on the percus@@ sions .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ Ratio will be multiplied , in which relationship Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multiplied , with the value n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) , this with the formula N * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) is calculated and then passed only . the value 40@@ 96 is being used in the map file not dec@@ im@@ al kom@@ mas ) . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM propos@@ es that a keyboard is supposed to play a keyboard around 40@@ 96 , a tone higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards about two tones up to a oc@@ t@@ ave higher to play . to try the right value on your keyboard , you must check a bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the dialog MIDI settings . this can be found in the menu under settings , point MIDI @-@ Settings &quot;
the Can@@ al@@ view is a window with a whole range of piano boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these pi@@ anos you can see which sounds are straight played .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel there is a selection list , where you have an instrument changed , lights of kno@@ b no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the Can@@ al@@ view has to display two different views ( until now ) two different views to display the pointed tones . the view in the menu settings below the point channel view : settings
&quot; the pace LCD displays the speed , with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the pace of a song . if you find , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow@@ down the pace , use the arrows left and right from LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a piece of music has to be played . it contains the notes , the speed , speed , &amp; etc ; . this may result the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way . &quot;
&quot; good , I can not force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file you can also change a similar sound quality . with a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this may happen if you have compiled a bin@@ ary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support has to compile and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos; s &apos; s ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; therefore , assi@@ sts &amp; k@@ mid ; Dra@@ g &amp; Drop . simply open the folder that you want to add in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ windows . &quot;
enable previously to enable the adjustment of automatic notes to the collection . otherwise the files are added to temporary collection .
you can click the arrow key left from Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow@@ ing the reproduction . to restore the default temp@@ o . click on the LCD @-@ click .
&quot; I have installed on a &amp; k@@ de ; working space a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ( if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file ) or I want to play a file , just into the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window change and drag the file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; if you want to listen only a file quickly without having to add a collection , turn it to a collection , turn the setting automatically added to the collection , and the new ; file will add to temporary collection files &quot;
&quot; we take you , you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . now , you only want to release the first file . so , you only want to add the settings to your collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection contains exactly these a MIDI file . &quot;
then do not close to B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid @-@ See and a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . all you thank you ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard I animated me that goes on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ ny in the third year , so I am not much time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a bit time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to collect a bit time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to collect some MIDI files , music make and pro@@ positions . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where they can download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me feel happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .es &quot;
&quot; you really want to send me a great pleasure , if you send me a postcard from your home or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . all that I want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file , you should contact me with me , as I would like to contact me as I might already have the file . &quot;

a sound card . I recommend you a good sound@@ card or an external syn@@ thesizer since the sound quality depends much on your sound@@ card . it is not the same as you use a FM device or a AW@@ E card .
&quot; if you have no sound card , you have to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound@@ card , except that you can of course hear any music . &quot;

&quot; &amp; km@@ player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , ph@@ ono and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files from M@@ Player or PH@@ ON@@ ON supported formats , as well as to play DVD &apos;s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet ended as a &amp; k@@ de ; on this machine was installed .
for additional help please check the KDE website to new versions or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user mail@@ ing list .
the application window is formed from so @-@ called windows . there is always the window with the central view . either there is a window with the playlist . and finally there is a information window that will only be displayed when information is re@@ mit .
&quot; it is possible to add the preferred connections under the menu book@@ marks , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries , which should be done after each other , you should use the category permanent playlist . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional Hier@@ archiving , if you copied an entry , his group and all its sub@@ assem@@ blies to the current category and playback begins with the attached entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories of actual piece &apos; , television and permanent playlist may also be changed through direct Edi@@ ting of XML configuration files . naturally , you can only do it if &amp; km@@ player ; it can only be done by an editor , but also by the application itself . by clicking on a name of a sub@@ group , only the XML contents of this part is displayed . &quot;
&quot; after modi@@ fying of XML files , it must be chosen from the menu the same with playlist , or select either the machining mode , or a different category . &quot;
all changes have lost when processing mode left or another group will be selected without the playlist .
&quot; as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; km@@ player , some functions can only be swit@@ ched by changing the XML configuration files .. &quot;
&quot; the animation at the strip and deliver@@ able can be disabled by the Edi@@ ting of ~ / .k@@ en / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c and modi@@ fying &quot; &#91; general Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , they can simply be inserted . &quot;
it is also possible to activate a different animation . &amp; km@@ player ; will note the files ~ / .k@@ en / share / apps / km@@ player / i@@ .x@@ ml / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation during St@@ arten do not need to be short , it is automatically ended by opening another source . this would dis@@ ruption with the end @-@ animation however , the user can therefore termin@@ ate the application a second time . &quot;
a simple example of a start@@ up animation may be the display of a favorite place : &amp; lt ; img ; &amp; lt ; img D@@ ur = &quot; inde@@ fin@@ ite = &quot; inde@@ fin@@ ite = &quot; inde@@ fin@@ ite = &quot;
there is a rider for configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog by &amp; km@@ player ; . here the path can be set from the M@@ Player and the intermediate memory size of the data base from the network and other things .
another tool for deb@@ ug is the kno@@ b &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of km@@ player . here is the output of M@@ Player .
there is no rider for this ren@@ ame in the configuration dialog by &amp; km@@ player ; everything must be configured by manu@@ el.@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c . here is an example of the set of the back@@ end via mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa is used :
&quot; Flash &apos;@@ can be played within &amp; km@@ player ; it can even be inserted the specific field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
&quot; thus , the &amp; km@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages can re@@ produce the &amp; km@@ player ; module as a service provider for the M@@ IME type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the set @-@ up file sub@@ ordin@@ ations of KDE . &quot;
&quot; the con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; km@@ player ; is used in a con@@ soles application and to search engines in the store of the browser module . the qu@@ aint process can occur . if there is no error , the back@@ end issue within &amp; km@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu to check ) . &quot;
&quot; thus , a given back@@ end for a certain M@@ IME type is taken ( of course only if this is also determined by manual modi@@ fying the file ~ / .k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example PH@@ ON@@ ON all og@@ g files can be re@@ covered : &quot;
&quot; this can be used by TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this need k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be configured , the scanner can be configured from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be manually posted . &quot;
&quot; to the configuration of the V@@ DR ( Video Data Rek@@ order ) Settings in the individual player , the dialog will be recognized in the settings under - &gt; source - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video port . there should be selected by which one is selected ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B in it . &quot;
&quot; since the V@@ DR may use X@@ Video to use X@@ Video , this type of play@@ player should function ( pres@@ um@@ ably this type of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one which works ) . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 Server must therefore be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) . &quot;
&quot; intern@@ ally are used by KM@@ Player for the sources of different names . at the time of this documentation , this dv@@ d@@ na@@ v@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , indi@@ source source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ cd@@ source and v@@ em@@ source . if they are activated , start playing with the playback of the playlist . &quot;
is there notice how I can make my CD@@ ROM drive if I remove from him ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command hd@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ dro@@ m is considered user root after connecting the device . it is absolutely sure to ensure that / dev / c@@ dro@@ m on the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
X@@ ine starts up only slowly but every time my CPU must be tested on their performance ?
note : the answer is over@@ b@@ . k@@ x@@ ine@@ Player automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time is X@@ ine the CPU . &quot;

latex : : a professional sh@@ iel@@ ding application . under Unix @-@ like systems is likely to be returned to the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; gt ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution . for installation should be used the documentation of the distribution or installation disc ; / DVD will be used .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; -@@ project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for various distribu@@ tions . these enable simple installation without further compil@@ ing and are included on the k@@ ile .
&quot; this hand@@ book is for everyone - regardless of the experience of &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; or &amp; Linux ; or &amp; Linux ; &quot;
&quot; advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions for the documentation is taken into account . the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact should be made via the k@@ ile . &quot;
&quot; if you have any questions about or when compil@@ ing &amp; k@@ ile ; or you will be desired , this should be addressed at the mail@@ ing list k@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ source@@ forge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; Lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; quot ; -@@ working area . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ programs in a graphical user interface and within this one simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made tools for complete , compil@@ ing and transform@@ ations for this . finally , the easy to use wiz@@ ard , the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ reference and the powerful project management . &quot;
&quot; to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and his opportunities to know , the manual should be attracted to Kate . user of &amp; k@@ ile ; can be directly with the reading of the chapters working with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; &quot;
&quot; for &amp; Lat@@ ex ; is the right out@@ fit : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . choose the ur@@ inary &amp; tex ; is also difficult to use , can also use a La@@ a ( English lay ) &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros is also possible that it is from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port . &quot;
&quot; we have given here only a good service to &amp; Lat@@ ex ; it is not the ultimate book about . so as H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; Lat@@ ex ; : Document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r . &quot;
&quot; just as other marks , called &amp; Lat@@ ex ; an introduction to be defined with the general characteristics such as paper format , Seit@@ an and tex@@ tual features such as paper format , the box begins with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ begin { document } again . &quot;
&quot; the Quick @-@ wiz@@ ard assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a native function for the fast creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; the selection of the wiz@@ ard ( men@@ tions ) offers some possibilities for the creation of the document . you can also place some of the document related settings . &quot;
&quot; document classes : hereby the type of document is wash@@ ed : articles ( article ) , book &#91; letter &#93; , report &#91; letter &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ aper &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ aper &#93; , author ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ aper &#93; , proj@@ ector &#91; &#91; &#93; &#93; or Custom @-@ defined . &quot;
key@@ ing : hereby the string coding is set . modern systems use the U@@ TF @-@ 8 -@@ enco@@ ding as standard . only if U@@ TF @-@ 8x should be used ( for correct processing of the &amp; latex she@@ aves ) .
&quot; this list contains the most commonly used additional packages for &amp; Lat@@ ex ; for the inclusion of them , they will only be full . &quot;
&quot; article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , Cover ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( for compliance with the German DIN standard provisions ) . &quot;
new users are not worried either . it is merely a brief description of the functions and further information will be published in the section .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; offers - just as other source code editors - the descent of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . by &amp; k@@ ile ; it is a simple problem for example . &quot;
&quot; with automatic trans@@ duc@@ ts of the environments , e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) of &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically creates a blank line ( e.g. \ \ \ &apos; command } ) . this function can be de@@ activated in the men@@ tions set up ... La@@ Te@@ X commands . &quot;
&quot; all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; Lat@@ ex ; expl@@ ores the sub@@ division of the document in the following elements ( part is the same and sub@@ ver@@ sible element ) : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the document in the struc@@ turing view , the individual elements can be trac@@ ed to the respective elements and be viewed . &quot;
in the preparation of the own &amp; Lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful . once a DVI ; -@@ Del@@ eted File ( engl . D e V ice I n@@ dependent File ) &#93; created to jum@@ ps &amp; k@@ ile ; by one click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ Viewer to the corresponding line in the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ source text .
&quot; a DVI ; file contains a description of the form@@ ati@@ zed document and also other information like the font , and also other information such as font ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools for viewing , conversion and to the printing of DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and sounds . &quot;
&quot; when using the Back@@ patch , the elements of the DVI ; file with the editor is recorded and once upon an element in the DVI ; -@@ source text is cli@@ cked on a section in the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ Source text is cli@@ cked on a section in the DVI ; -@@ source code . &quot;
Master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a Master document the work with other integrated .@@ tex files will be simpli@@ fied . when using a project a project @-@ wide Master document can be set to project preferences .
quick mounting : the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; source text will be compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if no error in the source code ) .
a file level : in this mode the DVI ; -@@ A file will be used and there is no call from &amp; Ok@@ ular ; after fast construction .
&quot; in the direction of the Bear@@ plane , the three co@@ asts should be stri@@ pped . the selection of common elements have been developed into the document . the first selection field is for the rapid structure of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The Mis@@ cellaneous &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands for sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; the selection field is further from articles such as tags , fu@@ elling notes or reference . the choices are available : &quot;
&quot; name : with this command a name for a section , an image or other element is created . &quot;
reference : is used for reference to a fixed name ( choice of a selection ) .
&quot; when using quot@@ ation , a selection list with liter@@ ary entries is shown . at &amp; bib@@ tex ; these files are necessary , if the file is necessary for a project . for the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bib@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; the author offers good experiences with &amp; k@@ bib@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; all files can be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand . &quot;
&quot; the final selection field with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ &quot; e is used to define the scri@@ bes . &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; k@@ ile ; are two choices for re@@ covering : 1 . the wiz@@ ard for the creation of a new document by selecting the documents and fes@@ tive settings . 2 . the document may be written by the bottom . &quot;
&quot; the br@@ aces according to the command \ \ Docum@@ class contain the settings for the command . the settings &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; lays the scri@@ bes , and will not happen at the beginning , this can also happen in the text . &quot;
&quot; once the above @-@ source example has been entered , the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ source text will be compiled . the easi@@ est way to this is the use of the menu or the button . &quot;
the source code must be saved in front of the comp@@ iler . &amp; k@@ ile ; the storage is automatically created .
&quot; the comp@@ iler of the document fails , in the prot@@ ocol@@ s should be sought after errors . when using quick @-@ building should be started and Occup@@ ular ; this is not the case , should also be observed , the prot@@ ocol@@ s should be observed . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( English environment ) is a text that will be treated differently from the individual document . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ \ &quot;
the elev@@ ators will only be within the surroundings ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no damage ( number ) for assistance within an environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities for sound@@ proof@@ ing the read@@ ability and usability of the document . you can place for example certain fonts , o@@ besity , pres@@ sur@@ es , etc . these commands will be used either with the command \ \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the cur@@ se pressure and is long as long as he is closed until he is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a sentence can be shown with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ value : creates a quote in the document . the quot@@ ation starts with \ \ begin { ratio } and ends with \ \ \ &apos; rate } .
&quot; after the background the writing of the source code with the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ Registration language , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for the creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile . &quot;
&quot; once in the wiz@@ ard was given a bit text , a few adjustments should be accomplished for the better read@@ ability of the document . this should be mind@@ . a quote , a few places in the fat and cur@@ se printing and a po@@ em to the application to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , can be returned using editor or Str@@ g e back to the editor . with an external viewer , whose window must be closed . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI ; the file was created , the document may be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file can be converted . simply au@@ try and Spa@@ eth . &quot;
DVI ; is a separate file format ( engl . D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; Lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of the .d@@ vi issue such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ transform@@ ator or computer screen . &quot;
for the print of a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - then the document can be printed ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is correct ) .
the work@@ force re@@ covers the conversion of DVI ; -@@ files in other formats . once the DVI ; -@@ File from the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; its source text was created , the conversion can start out by means of the button in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
the Next look for the direct jump from the editor to the full position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; provides a corresponding setting for all &amp; latex files . there must be just modern under settings K@@ ile setup ... tools combined .
&quot; to adjust the navigation search , the mouse @-@ line needs to be positioned in a line of the source code and close to it . the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI ; -@@ Viewer will take place . &quot;
this function in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; will be specified with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; the document of &amp; Lat@@ ex ; a document of &amp; k@@ ile ; in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; as a tex@@ ture ( settings oc@@ ular setup ... Editor )
&quot; should be used when using quick@@ set of the &amp; DVI ; the viewer , a mistake can occur . should an error occurs , this is shown in the prot@@ ocol@@ s file or in the message range . &quot;
&quot; the prot@@ ocol@@ s file re@@ kl@@ ed the error source in the source text . in the editor will always be the line , in which the error appears . the prot@@ ocol@@ s file will always be used to the faul@@ ts , must be cli@@ cked on the faul@@ ts in the prot@@ ocol@@ s and &amp; k@@ ile ; jump to faul@@ ty line . &quot;
&quot; once you click on the appropriate button in the tool@@ bar , appears a window to choose from the template used for the document . the presented possibilities are : &quot;
a document may be written either from scratch or wiz@@ ard for fast creation of a new document . further information is included in the section .
&quot; the user of &amp; Lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for virtually all documents . templates enables you to place in &amp; k@@ ile , saved and loaded in order to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either must create an existing &amp; tex ; - / Lat@@ ex ; a new template is created . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template by using an existing document and selection of file template . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document a template using file New will be replaced by other data ( such as name or string coding ) . these variables can be set up in settings , set up ... Settings . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which string chains of which variables are replaced : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string is replaced by input in documentary class . typically they are used by the input in document class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { article } .
&quot; the easi@@ est way to create a template is the use of assist@@ ants , and with the connect@@ ed@@ ness in the editor . once the document was created in this way : &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , then the own template may be considered by default . &quot;
a template may be created from any &amp; Lat@@ ex ; files will be created in a simple way to create a template that should be sought after one in the internet and carried out under the steps described above .
&amp; k@@ ile ; used as internal editor . &amp; k@@ ate ; as internal Editor . &amp; k@@ ate ; is a text editor for many different types of text files ( including also &amp; Lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bib@@ tex ; ) . many settings to be made directly from &amp; k@@ ile ;
&quot; to know more about them &amp; k@@ ate ; and its grounds , the manual should be attracted to Kate . user of &amp; k@@ ile ; they can place directly with the reading of the chapters working with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; latex reference , which can be called a key description almost all commands that can be found in &amp; Lat@@ ex ; use , as well as their syntax . &quot;
&quot; a double @-@ click with dr@@ illed Str@@ g button to select the &amp; tex ; -@@ word to select the Click \ \ \ \ \ \ par \ \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p is only \ \ par . &quot;
&quot; when drawing the text with dr@@ illed left mouse button , the full text will automatically be copied into the clip@@ board . &quot;
when using the arrow keys with a dr@@ illed roll you can taste parts of the source code in the edi@@ tor@@ window .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; has the opportunity to browse the most different types of sources texts and to highlight this her@@ ence . for example , the &amp; Lat@@ ex , differ from normal text and also the mathemati@@ cal form@@ ul@@ as are highlighted by another color . &quot;
many assist@@ ants enables you to place an own kind of book@@ marks within the text . this feature is highlighted the jump to n@@ Ã ¤ ge or final spr@@ inkl@@ es . it is also highlighted this spring@@ time that it is automatically loaded during the first entry of a drawing .
&quot; the Edit is probably one of the main pe@@ ditions during the use of a program such as &amp; k@@ ile . although &amp; k@@ ate ; important features for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source and special commands for their selection . under Edit , the following commands are included in the following choice : &quot;
&quot; select a complete paragraph ( group of lines included on both sides a blank line ) . with a paragraph does not include a text with per@@ me@@ ated lines ( such as in other tex@@ te@@ dit@@ ors ) . this extended meaning is not a text containing all other tex@@ te@@ dit@@ ors ) . this extended meaning is not a text containing all other tex@@ te@@ dit@@ ors ) . this extended importance is not a text containing all other tex@@ te@@ dit@@ ors ) . this extended meaning is completely separated , and the other lines of the source code . &quot; the only preventive thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; is therefore that the deposits are separated by two bare lines . &quot;
&quot; choose the word under the current cursor position . this selection also has an extended meaning , since this command also &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ Com@@ mands with a cl@@ assy star ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) . &quot;
&quot; for the purpose of a part of the document can be well balanced , and by pressing the key . &amp; k@@ ate ; offers the entire line . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers with its own commands below . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the following commands to include the following commands : &quot;
remove a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is included in the description to Edit paragraph .
it has already been clear@@ ed that environments a central role in &amp; Lat@@ ex ; therefore offers &amp; k@@ ile ; for N@@ F more commands in Edit environment for an easy work with &amp; Lat@@ ex ;
with this command becomes the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to the ter@@ mination of the environment .
with this command becomes the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to the chim@@ ney &apos;s bike .
if the cursor is before or within the command \ \ begin { surroundings } is located at the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; in the input of many prescribed ambi@@ ent instruction can get lost quickly the cost @-@ cut off . this command close , the last exposed environment , so that the wast@@ ed ambi@@ ent structure is not included . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; groups that are determined by brack@@ ets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X Group are a few important commands that correspond to those from Edit environment .
this command becomes the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the gro@@ ove cl@@ amp .
this command becomes the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed right behind the soft@@ ening cl@@ amp .
&quot; if the cursor is before or behind the back@@ drop of a &amp; tex ; group # is located at the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
in the input of many spar@@ ed groups and br@@ aces can get lost quickly the cost @-@ cut down . this command close the least the last ground@@ ed structure of the &amp; tex ; -@@ groups cannot be assigned .
in &amp; Lat@@ ex ; two simple beginn@@ ings of work is used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign of the beginn@@ ings will be used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign &quot; for two simple beginn@@ ings will be used . &quot;
this automatic inser@@ tion of double occupancy can be set under settings K@@ ile setup ... La@@ Te@@ X .
you can also use any length of similar settings ( such as n@@ german or french ) and thus a German or fran@@ cal beginn@@ ings . there are also many other languages available .
&quot; when pus@@ hing the Shift ; input &amp; k@@ ile ; a smart z@@ eil@@ en@@ um@@ ar . if the current position within a lists environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or item@@ ize ) , for example , the command \ \ item can be found . &quot;
within a tables - close @-@ up &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an end @-@ proof tooth dec@@ lined .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pre@@ defined &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . this enables you to place under settings k@@ ile ; create ... La@@ Te@@ X added .
&quot; some users collabor@@ ate the columns in tables in tables and thereby all the E@@ t @-@ signs ( amp ; ) among each other . &amp; k@@ ile ; seeks this to er@@ ected tab@@ ulator in the final line . although this tab@@ ulator is not the de@@ composition ; according to the n@@ alian tab@@ ulator in the final row . although this tab@@ ulator is not the per@@ t@@ inent tab@@ ulator in the final row . although this tab@@ ulator is not the de@@ composition ; according to the n@@ alian tab@@ ulator in the final row . although this tab@@ ulator is not the de@@ composition ; according to the full tab@@ ulator , for the columns position of the current tab . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; k@@ ate ; already a good source code has been installed , this in &amp; k@@ ile ; for special commands ( usually set in different modes of work . all these modes are available for different working methods under settings K@@ ile set ... Re@@ duc@@ t . &quot;
&quot; when entering a new environment using the command \ \ begin { surroundings } , &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically the command \ \ end { surroundings } after an empty line ( for the text ) add to an empty line ( for the text ) . &quot;
&quot; when pus@@ hing the back taste , the last letter of the input is removed and disc@@ ard@@ ed by the complete list of the input list . on the other hand , the list may be made by entering another letter also . &quot;
&quot; all commands will be written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are not far from selecting a command . alternatively to place by &amp; k@@ ile ; also Spr@@ inkl@@ es can be paid , so that a simple jump to this positions can be interpreted by editing spring@@ time jumping . &quot;
under settings k@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile ; complete settings can be done to these lists . it enables you to be able to use various wiz@@ ards for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Com@@ mands as well as instructions from the general language use .
&quot; the command mode is for the complete set of environments . there are always a couple of letters with \ \ begin entered , and the call of the full list with ambi@@ ent file will be used . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for the completion of the environments . &quot;
&quot; in the call of the trans@@ duc@@ t mode , the menu is automatically align@@ ed and it appears \ \ begin { . afterwards , the ambi@@ ent can continue on the easi@@ est way and can be completed by pressing the entry . &quot;
&quot; after this is accomplished , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; k@@ ile ; recogni@@ zes that it is a list of lists , is even a first \ \ item command . &quot;
&quot; under settings k@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile ; ampli@@ fied settings to these lists are made . this mode uses the use of the trans@@ duc@@ t mode for &quot; &quot; &amp; tex ; - and &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ Com@@ mands . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; support user @-@ defined lists of down@@ sides , which are immediately replaced by cl@@ adding string chains . the lists can be set up by using Settings ... K@@ ile Ver@@ tical list . as an example of a document list , the file may contain L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; for example , the letter L entered the letter L and the word of the ren@@ unci@@ ation mechanism over the letter , is replaced by the letter L by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; Gro@@ oming , tax ev@@ asion are not helpful . however , has been noticed that many W@@ ear@@ ers are written in a document more than once written in a document . this offers &amp; k@@ ile ; the trans@@ duc@@ ts are already written . &quot;
&quot; this mode can set up in men@@ stru@@ ment@@ ed settings ... K@@ ile Ver@@ tical , can be worn . here also the vibrations are set to be set . &quot;
the trans@@ duc@@ ts files are to be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ ile / desk / mode / mode / mode ( subscription ) , Dic@@ tionary ( transfers ) or tex . &quot;
&quot; the dialog are designed for graphics as easy as possible . for the purpose of the bases of the bases on the graphics formats , the sections and del@@ ays should be observed . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as known as PDF files , but also provide an excellent basis for assistance and re @-@ ordin@@ ations of pages . the PDF file is arranged , so you can re@@ arranged the pages with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; -@@ tools re@@ arranged and then with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; to be able to place the result of the work , the source code has to be compiled . all building tools are group@@ ed in the men@@ ades create compil@@ ing , creating conversion and create view . &quot;
&quot; for the compact the source code for viewer like &amp; Ok@@ ular ; or another transformation can be used by the DVI ; 3 , the DVI ; 4 the DVI ; 4 the DVI ; file into a PS file , and by means of old ; 5 the PS file can be viewed . &quot;
&quot; when using the command quick , usually a viewer is called according to the comp@@ iler . should not be used an in@@ und@@ ed vie@@ wers , so it will be a new window . &quot;
a new project will be asked about the project &apos;s project .... here is the following information for the project :
&quot; when selecting the filename window , the relative path must be specified by the .k@@ ep@@ r project . &quot;
the script function of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows the output of EC@@ MA@@ Script -@@ Ko@@ de . the scripts can be managed in the vertical body .
the API scripts are not yet developed and enables you to place in other versions of &amp; k@@ ile .
&quot; first must be said that the output environment of the scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a system @-@ wide object ( = k@@ ile ) has the following methods : &quot;
&quot; &amp; Lat@@ ex ; is a quite prono@@ unced system , in which the basic functions will be expanded through a variety of available packages . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a lot of different sc@@ iss@@ ants to support users . &quot;
&amp; illu@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are included with many documents . this includes a documentation for the contained packages and another &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ reference .
&quot; a full Re@@ fern@@ z Re@@ fern@@ z &quot; &quot; &amp; tex ; and it is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather it is ideal for a specific form@@ atting . since it is a very large @-@ called document , it is divided in &amp; k@@ ile ; in three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents with those &amp; lic@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; supplied , the finding of the right document does not always offer . as much assistance , the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k provides a database with all to &amp; k@@ ile ; supplied documents and herein . &quot;
&quot; all documents are divided into categories and the gr@@ ated advantage is the search for par@@ cel name or stroke . by &amp; k@@ ile , then only the results are displayed . &quot;
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or the bedding of the Le@@ ading the viewer to the document .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; Lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; -@@ Source tex@@ te@@ di@@ tor , which can be carried out on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; - and Unix systems , also on &amp; Mac ; also on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS @-@ X . &quot;

&quot; the plugins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; they have little to do with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . thus , the plug @-@ system is very powerful . they can &apos;t wait until someone will be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; more information they can be found below . &quot;
&quot; to install a plugin or a part , we start with the menu of plugins . this is the following dialog open : &quot;
this dialog allows to manage all the plugins and add new plugins . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plugins without a storage place &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to the search of the plug @-@ ins .
often work on a project for several persons in a type of hier@@ arch@@ ical relationship . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nickname is the user name of the user and serves to clear identification .
a member can have several roles in the project as well as sub@@ project leader .
&quot; the user can look out from the list of Team@@ members , who he is . this is done by doing the team member from the list and put the button as pressing . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appear f@@ ett after you are : text . &quot;
first name and setting of own identity are important to news and comments . see for further information regarding notes .
&quot; in addition to the overview of their team , there is an additional advantage by the recording of the members of the team : it can be an event for information to the team leader when something particular is happening . see in for further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that will be executed when something defined in the project . an example would be seen how much someone worked , or the Send a message when a file is backed up , or a script that is added to the CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the side event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings , it can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an em@@ mail will be sent to the address specified in the recipients . the Ad@@ res@@ sat can be an team@@ - or sub@@ project leader . see in whose such lad@@ der will be established .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
notes is easy . it can either choose the note -@@ entry from the editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a commentary area followed by an@@ oci@@ et@@ ext .
&quot; notes may be sent to a determin@@ able member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , a role in the project consisting of the following possibilities : team @-@ project conduc@@ tors should be specified in the project or sub@@ project lad@@ ders , as in the following examples below . &quot;
&quot; names and roles @-@ names are independent of large or small ones , but spaces for the brack@@ ets and the : make the note was invali@@ d . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and form@@ atting languages , the D@@ T@@ D edi@@ agnos@@ is and web@@ based form@@ atting and scrip@@ ting languages . &quot;
&quot; the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are covered , a short description for the others can be found in . &quot;
the settings can be set up by settings Qu@@ anta . this dialog will be called on some pages that will be dealt with each other .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including car completion can be changed . the entries are :
&quot; large / small @-@ writing of tags : large / inf@@ ul@@ sion of automatically attached tags . normal wholesale / inf@@ ul@@ sion means , the tags are as inserted as they are described in the same XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / inf@@ ul@@ sion of attri@@ bu@@ ds : large / inf@@ ul@@ sion of automatically attached attri@@ bu@@ ds . normal Groß / inf@@ ul@@ sion means , the attributes are as inserted as they are described in the same XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags automatically close : if attached , is optional for tags , for which the final day is optional , this immediately after &amp; gt ; included . &quot;
not optional tags automatically close : as above for any other tags with the exception of the simple tags .
&quot; start and conclusion @-@ day automatically update : if swit@@ ched , the corresponding tour will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic detection of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of ac@@ zent@@ u@@ ated characters in the corresponding enco@@ ding during inhal@@ ation .
m@@ ime types : mim@@ ics types for detection of different types of files . by button Standard can be re@@ covered the default file .
default file enco@@ ding : enco@@ ding of newly created or in other way than with file open open files ( where enco@@ ding of the file can be over@@ loaded ) but this setting is loaded from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
&quot; Standard D@@ T@@ D : the selected D@@ T@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ T@@ D has not been recognized . this setting here is st@@ olen by the same in the project properties , if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates regular backup copies , so that at a current start of the program the document can be restored from this backup . this is not the same as the memory of the file . it is not saved a backup regularly , according to the specified time , created . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the edi@@ tor@@ ment or own view ( or the documentation in a box ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , the preview and source text at the same time . &quot;
the window settings to the standard back to the next start is useful when the user interface comes by modi@@ fying the MDI modes and do@@ cking / depend on views through each other . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the war@@ nings management range serves the taxes of the possibility to dis@@ connect the display of war@@ nings by an@@ h@@ ooks of no longer .
&quot; the place to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; it may be specified in symbols instead of scripts , as well as the synchron@@ isation of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code in the shared mode . &quot;
&quot; here , the Par@@ ser and the struc@@ turing , which represents the figure of the Par@@ ser No@@ des in the document , in detail . &quot;
&quot; in the area of mouse @-@ click on the struc@@ turing of the following action , it is possible to change by clicking the struc@@ ting structure with the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; in the struc@@ t settings , the visibility of no@@ des can be opened in the tree , the actu@@ alization of the tree at editing and how deep when a change of the structure is automatically opened , deleted . bare no@@ des are the empty spaces in the text , while the empty groups are not found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; the area to determine the abbrevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) which can be un@@ folded to extensive text . abbrevi@@ ations are valid in groups , each may be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s , it can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . this means it can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . this means it can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . this means it can be valid for a group in a group of Jav@@ ascript . &quot;
&quot; here the plugins are managed . plug @-@ ins are K@@ part @-@ applications from third party , which can be re@@ used by any part @-@ capable application , the most famous &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ ins must be stated : &quot;
address : the path to the plugin if it is not in a standard place like $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / lib .
&quot; input : this information is given to the plug @-@ in , so it can open the current file to the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project board . &quot;
&quot; component in the &quot; &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; mode load : check if the plugin refuse to be den@@ ied . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ parts usually refuse the store if this option is not chosen . &quot;
&quot; check the plug @-@ in : this is enabled , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; whether the given information is correct , but when the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , the Troub@@ leshooting was completely new . the support for the db@@ g Deb@@ ug@@ ger was set up , as well as the support for the db@@ g Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead of this became a deb@@ ug@@ ger plug @-@ in concept , which allows various Impl@@ ement@@ ations about plugins . &quot;
&quot; currently only a plugin available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; adds . &quot;
the use of deb@@ ug@@ gers for a project begins with selecting a suitable deb@@ ug@@ ger plug @-@ ins in the project settings . with the button options next to the deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin selection can be changed to specific settings .
&quot; when a project is activated a deb@@ ug@@ ger , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ user interface : &quot;
a view which is displayed in the contents of covered variables . usually appears in the left do@@ ck .
&quot; a view , in which all steps , with tick @-@ points and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower Dock . &quot;
a view in which the output is shown ( like in HTML ) of the deb@@ ug@@ gers . usually appears in the lower Dock .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the deb@@ ug , everything or part of the following functionality available . &quot;
&quot; with this action the connection to the deb@@ ug@@ ger , if necessary , or she shares the plugin to listen to Deb@@ u@@ gan@@ try . this action is opened by default , which is applied to a deb@@ ug@@ ger so that in Nor@@ mal@@ case does not have to be respected . &quot;
the object to deb@@ ug@@ gen session Star@@ ship the session . includes the connection to the deb@@ ug@@ ger or ends the running to requirements .
sends a HTTP requirement to the server to see a deb@@ ug requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this requirement is displayed in the view deb@@ ug@@ ger issue .
&quot; indicates the deb@@ ug@@ ger , begin with the execution of the script and date information about the covered variables as well as the currently exec@@ utable line . if this happens during the script , the execution will continue , the script starts with the requirement . &quot;
&quot; points the deb@@ ug@@ ger to begin with the execution of the script , without information about over@@ hau@@ led variables and the current tick number . if this happens , while a script is performed , the execution is running on as soon as a deb@@ ug requirement will begin . &quot;
the deb@@ ug@@ ger takes the next instruction in the script without move into the functions or includes the target .
the deb@@ ug@@ ger takes the next instruction in the script when possible in functions and includes included .
&quot; points the deb@@ ug@@ ger to go the statement and go to the next so , as if there were the current . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog in which a variable or expression can be entered , which is supposed to be monitored . the horizontal value appears in the variable view . &quot;
with this dialog a variable or a new value of a variable are set .

this chapter describes how you can customize and can adapt to your needs and how you can help &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
&quot; documentary type Edit ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to provide support for Mark@@ up@@ - and scripts , as well as &amp; CSS ; a quick , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for Web@@ Develop@@ ers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and the work@@ force . &quot; &quot; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two parts , the tag folder and the work@@ force . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ T@@ D . see in for details on conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; the p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bar . short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes of tags , as well as the layout and content of the peculi@@ arity di@@ alog@@ es , the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for the day . &quot;
&quot; tag folder are nothing but folder . they contain only the &amp; b@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder carry the name of the descri@@ p@@ ation language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ Review ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declar@@ es whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible , so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is shown in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only happen once in a document . it may contain the definition of many tags , but contains the element of many other tags otherwise nothing . &quot;
the type of the tags is a script function . when using is &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the day @-@ type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type . returns the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the day has a new attri@@ bute group and the attributes in this tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
sets up a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ Tag determined by the &amp; lt ; this is an just element type element .
&quot; describes a attri@@ bute of any tags . this item can only exist once for each attri@@ bute . additionally it places the name and type of the attributes . additionally it contains other tags , describe how this attri@@ bute is to be shown &amp; etc ; This is an element element element . &quot;
returns the used source code for the attributes in the day @-@ Edi@@ tor@@ dialog and in the attri@@ bute tree !
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p metho@@ dology within a &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; will be used to achieve the data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an inter@@ section and metho@@ dology name . the arguments that will be handed over to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tags . &quot;
a cruci@@ ble day that group the elements of a list together . it can only exist for a attri@@ bute of only once . it is a only one element element .
sets the position of the attri@@ bute of a tags within a dialog box . this day can only happen for any attri@@ bute in dialogue only once ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the item is empty .
returns the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for each field in dialogue ( e.g. one for each and lt ; label &gt; Day ) . this item is empty .
prints a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags . this item is an element type .
prints a list of elements that end a day . this item is an element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; -@@ De@@ mail@@ ing start : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 enco@@ ding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be neat and closed .
&quot; space do not affect anything but watch out &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; b@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; replace , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
to check the Tag@@ XML files is the tools dialog in the above &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; window to start and check out Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions .
this function is currently not available . currently the review will only take place when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
in the following one example for a family 1 day @-@ file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; element of the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ Schema . the filename for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following an example of a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; transmission function described . the filename of this Tag@@ XML file is to be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; enco@@ ding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; &quot;
&quot; the &amp; D p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is as fairly simple and there is an editor for this , accessible via D@@ T@@ D settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created with the following entries : &quot;
&#91; general &#93; Version = use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ T@@ D @-@ Information . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / D@@ T@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Nickname = The simpli@@ fied name of D@@ T@@ D . ( html 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as Nickname . &quot;
an action can set forth settings ... click on new action to the same dialogue :
this action is assigned to the keyboard short@@ cut . with clicking the button custom can be assigned a keyboard short@@ cut ; with K@@ eine is the current keyboard short@@ cut .
&quot; the simpl@@ est actions . it can be entered into the detailed settings , and in execution of action this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below . &quot;
&quot; this is the most powerful action plan . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually Skri@@ p@@ te , but it is not limited ) to change the document or use the various See in ... promotions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; although qualified pipes are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variation in the command line : $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variations that can be used in the command line : &quot;
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file , file : / out of the document name . &quot;
% P@@ ID : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance running is the text change to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used for controlling &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the external script is used .
the parameters for this event is usually the filename of the current document or the path to the project file .
&quot; in addition to the above methods , a script can specify a script of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; at the default entry . in the selection field input can be determined , what is to send to the default delivery . &quot;
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only with this setting sensible .
&quot; according to the input , the output of the completed application can be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , on the default output page ; error messages can be specified by default , by the value the selection of the output is set by : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . in the case it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the Mark@@ ups . &quot;
&quot; once a work@@ force is added , you need to add promotions and configure . select settings . &quot;
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new action button at the bottom of the window starts the editing mode .
fill in all the fields and add the day to the appropriate tool .
&quot; complete everything and if the day of attributes , and you plan their use , activate the &quot; Tag &quot; &quot; when available , in order to enter the action . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is that a ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; for creating a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; calibr@@ ating ; , graphics other programs ( or where else it is located in its distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ washer edit ; used by default 32x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others . &quot;
&quot; please note that the written icon is not only helping you to remember what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the day starts , I decided to create a laun@@ cher than a symbol . by using green ( green is usually referred to ) , or should at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ alized ; &quot;
&quot; after the creation of symbols , it must still be connected with the action . this happens through the menu with settings promotions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder in which the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the apply button and continue with other tags , so there are or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
supp@@ ose you want to add some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to the tool@@ bar complement or it should adjust this to better overview by some separ@@ ators in several groups . open the tool@@ bar and adjust the tool@@ bar . make sure that the tool@@ bar is selected .
&quot; I want to select the separ@@ ator ( totally left above ) for my work@@ force . after the selection of the element that should be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to give you a quick way to access the con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; please note , like the separ@@ ators support the group@@ ing . somebody who does not know my work is not known , could believe that the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ kno@@ b the opposite of the start @-@ button . &quot;
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by pro@@ ving all symbols to ensure that everything works .
&quot; back in the right folder . after re@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be stored in the right folder , but your work tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder , so that their work is loaded ( s ) , if a file is opened from the appropriate type . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the most mentioned expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal users , the option to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the form@@ ulation language you like . therefore describes this chapter how to create a &amp; PHP ; -@@ Documentation Tree for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory , whether someone has done that for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you have to seek an existing documentation for form@@ atting , / script / etc ; -@@ language . then you need to create the doc@@ r@@ c file . then we have to treat the doc@@ r@@ c file . &quot;
&quot; # KDE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc you = pf@@ ad , relative to this file , to document documentation Section 1 = # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 Sec@@ 1 = Sec@@ 2.@@ .html &quot;
the section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentary tree . for example you see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation is something :
&quot; # KDE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc you = php@@ 42 / # top level of top element = PHP 4.2 , &quot; &quot; Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = index.html &quot; ... &quot; = Su@@ tion@@ .html ... Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age.@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .html ... &quot;
notice the # before getting started and Language Reference . that shows that it is about sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the chess @-@ sti@@ pul@@ p ( except by reason ) md@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the directory is directly refer@@ enced to a file ( and in@@ consistent with the top end of the construction &amp; md@@ ash ; a folder is displayed ! ) .
whit@@ esp@@ ace affect nothing but watch out &amp; and &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
&quot; the content @-@ section is the area of the doc@@ r@@ c file , which is to be displayed in the context of the context @-@ sensitive aid . for example , if writing a &amp; PHP ; or script the documentation for the mysq@@ l _ fetch _ array function , the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the Cont@@ ext@@ list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file binding . &quot;
&quot; a simple list of by practic@@ ed context @-@ elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot;
&quot; now you can easily store your file doc@@ r@@ c / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you have specified in your file doc@@ r@@ c ) in the same folder as doc@@ r@@ c and copy your HTML documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you are sure that these are good and it worth to be shared , send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation were used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for the use of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ rep@@ osit@@ ory for the use of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ rep@@ osit@@ ory for the use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ rep@@ osit@@ ory for the use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ rep@@ osit@@ ory for the use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ rep@@ osit@@ ory for the use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; are you not alone . it is possible to share the resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , work tool with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent by e @-@ mail to friends , partners or otherwise made to be sent . at different places , there is an email sending menu entry , like D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the script tree . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all the other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can be downloaded and only available if our team considers it as correct and us@@ eless for publishing , where it is a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . thus , the origin of resources guarantees both for our team and for later users . &quot;
&quot; in the up@@ loading , you will be asked for their private G@@ PG @-@ key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase will not be stored ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , you can create an output . in the dialog new resource , you need to check out the input fields ( URL Pre@@ view can be empty ) and by clicking OK the sky@@ line will be started . &quot;
&quot; the up@@ loading can upload from the menus D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , upload work tool@@ bar and in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , yet prior to the installation , investig@@ ated &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the un@@ expl@@ oration of the resource by checking the integrity and signature . in case of problems war@@ ns it and it can then be cancelled . if the integrity was given and the resource correct , a message appears with the specification of the copyright of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work on XML languages , which is currently not yet supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it is necessary to work by a D@@ TE@@ P package . it can be necessary because hundreds of day files in the day XML format may be necessary . there is the simpl@@ est way to convert a D@@ T@@ D package to a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
&quot; the conversion can be started from the menu D@@ T@@ D loading and Convert one D@@ T@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ T@@ D description which should be used . after that , the following dialogue will be used : &quot;
target name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ C@@ TY@@ PE Defin@@ i@@ fication line : the string string which will be in ! DO@@ C@@ TY@@ PE day how HTML Public - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / D@@ T@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN http : / / www.w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ ml@@ 4 / lo@@ os@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d
&quot; setting of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion , brings forth &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; according to the transformation of the &amp; M p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; Editor , with the details of newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this possibility . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . in order to understand this and get full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this chapter is trying to bring them precisely these concepts without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; little benefits . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the work area is divided into three areas : global , locally and proj@@ ected . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; global elements are used for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ agon@@ ism ; use , available . of work is available , in the joint folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this enables the group of administ@@ rators to secure different materials , actions and patterns in global tree , then each in a multi @-@ user environment at your disposal . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of Web@@ Develop@@ ers for a single user . these are user @-@ specific pattern and work@@ force . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
&quot; project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be done by &amp; CSS ; -@@ Must@@ ard up to work@@ force with special actions especially for the files of a particular project . simply said , this is the most limited size . all elements are placed in Ord@@ inary Tree of the project , which are the sharing of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ MDI ; consists of some main areas : the Edi@@ tor@@ window , the construction materials , the cart@@ els with info and the tool is available . please hit in , and for further information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click on the boxes with the right mouse button to get an context menu with the current documents pass@@ words , re@@ charging , delete or up@@ loading of the document , jump to a book@@ marks or version of CV@@ S commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; legal kli@@ fts in Edi@@ tor@@ ment lead to another context menu regarding the edited document contents , such as basic processing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , editing the mouse under the mouse @-@ ger or opening the file when the string cursor is referred to a file . &quot;
&quot; at the top end of the edi@@ tor@@ ches are the tool@@ bar of the Edi@@ tors . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is shown as default ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as default , for which a set of tool is shown . as part of the further development of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the tool is adapted to the new features and associated user needs . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool@@ bar is really easy . if they want to insert one day , for example &amp; lt ; then click on the icon that the day is represented , then they can insert the data for this just one day , you can insert the data for this just one day , you can fill in a dialog different fields . &quot;
&quot; the construction works ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow it to navigate in the information of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , to open and penet@@ rate . in the representation of cart@@ ography stand for files , project , designs , scripts , attributes , attributes , attributes and documentation . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool , which provides all the files in the project and allows the removal of files in the project by means of right mouse click . actions such as adding , dischar@@ ge , up@@ loading or delet@@ ing the files from storage media , with the then shown context menu . &quot;
&quot; another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . nearly everything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; There are all possibilities open . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories , depending on how to use them . global templates are always available , local templates are available only for the respective users and templates in projects are available only in the project . more on templates is available . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of re@@ integration in Global , Local and Project also works here . through clicking on the right mouse button you can retri@@ eve the available information to a script . via the right mouse button is available as the script to edit , edit or send us with E@@ Mail . &quot;
&quot; with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . by links @-@ click of an element , the cursor is set in the document to the position of the element . by Right @-@ click of an element , a list of commands in relation to navigation and refres@@ her of the tree . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears under the other construction views . with it can change the attributes , and nam@@ ing rooms change . this is possible to change all available attributes with few clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation for the web technology for your development . you can download the documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you can create own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can add @-@ specific documentation , and be considered . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Paul ; two boxes at the bottom of the window , can be reached via the useful information : the communication window and the problem window . &quot;
this map shows information about each in Qu@@ anta running script . thus the D@@ T@@ D of the current document and all changes made available to the D@@ T@@ D .
&quot; this map shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ scripts , all the error messages can be executed in this window . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ins are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the appropriate command line . the Cho@@ col@@ ates of the tool@@ bar is the possibility of define own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
another feature of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a work@@ force with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool@@ bar as a com@@ pressing T@@ ar archive through &amp; k@@ mail ; they can backup these in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; how to secure and load them !
it is reasonable when you want to adjust the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; files can be adjusted to your system . in order to get a complete list of options that can be transferred to the configure script . the options are easy to understand and do not run here .
&quot; if you have problems with the types of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should ensure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the PAT@@ H before their bin folder is . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the KDE @-@ surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; was optimized for rapid Web development and combined with a wide range of powerful functions .
&quot; during the effort , the best &amp; HTML ; -@@ Editor to create , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus : what would be , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus : what would be ? now , this would make him an absolutely great Web @-@ development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer on re@@ ines &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summar@@ ized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then you should be the appropriate &amp; IDE ; &quot;
&quot; now , to the above mentioned claim has to be arrested , that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developers , in good use of free software , the idea of why someone has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ rum@@ ors is not only this possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; so to extend how they need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows web@@ developers to improve the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( MDI ; ) . this can extend the productivity at almost every task . through the program , they can bro@@ aden it &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ( more about it can be found in . ) &quot;
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web conversion environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for a fast web development and quickly expanded to an mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus is in any way associated with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; connected to the original developers caused the GPL @-@ li@@ zen@@ ed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more information about the details is using help : / qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ help@@ center help : / qu@@ anta run ) . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ anta ; is currently developed and maintained by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon sequ@@ it@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick @-@ print list of files that you have opened . this list is changed every time when you open a file , which is not listed on it , whereby the oldest entry is taken . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . take a look at the section about templates . should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project deposits , only one mistake is reported . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ ts when inser@@ ting the clip@@ board there included special characters on the &amp; HTML , so that they are displayed correctly and not be understood by the browser as form@@ atting instructions . &quot;
conver@@ ts the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; indicates which the correct way to inser@@ tion particular signs and spaces in &amp; URL ; s is used primarily for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s in the an@@ chor day .
&quot; ob@@ sol@@ ete the block selection , or from . this allows you to select text@@ blocks with the help of &amp; shift ; taste . &quot;
goes directly to a tick number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script error messages can be found !
sear@@ ches a string chain or regular expression in the selected directory . a type of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expres@@ sions to help you .
displays the message range or not an . this is the window where you see the display of scripts and deb@@ ug@@ ger .
- and switching of the problem of the problem at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the problem of the problem is activated once you switch to struc@@ turing .
displays the tool@@ sp@@ old on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with the entries previous or Next , depending on the position of the cursor in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other un@@ opened documents appear in the menu according to the filename of other documents .
opens a existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
&quot; sear@@ ches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows for example graphics files in your project folders or sub@@ folder , and then add it to the project . &quot;
load files in your project on the server high . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; from and whether you have downloaded more inputs / output modules ( K@@ IO sl@@ aves ) .
settings as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project manages . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Projects you can find the details explained .
&quot; you can find a project @-@ tool bar . these are preserved in Project you / tool@@ bar , and only in this menu if you have assigned it to this project . &quot;
a dialog to save your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : locally or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions must be saved by settings actions . work will be saved through work tool@@ bar or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bar .
&quot; remo@@ ves a work@@ force from the point of view . this delet@@ es not saved from the hard disk . if you have not saved the tool@@ bar , you will be asked if you want to do it . &quot;
this allows you to send their own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Team so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next publication ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool &apos;s tool than app@@ endi@@ x .
&quot; allows the up@@ loading of tool@@ bar on the main server , where each other can access to it . see in . &quot;
&quot; invite one &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; you have made or anyone else made someone else , and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own circum@@ cis@@ ed format . &quot;
&quot; up@@ loading of the entities from the &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; it is useful when the En@@ tit@@ ets from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; to ren@@ ew , without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; to ren@@ ew , if this global is and a sp@@ elling in the global KDE folder is not available , deleted the shop . &quot;
&quot; this menu includes a list of the tags , which is present in the currently working tool is available . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool is loaded , there is in the tags menu a sub@@ menu standard , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current day settings , if there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tags always present , followed by &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus . &quot;
activ@@ ates or de@@ activated the intelligent inser@@ ting tags . currently this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the inser@@ ting by means of work is ref@@ used to ref@@ used the rules .
&quot; in the plugins menu , the available plugins are listed under the above listed below . click the click &quot; click &quot; Set of an active plug @-@ in plugins . &quot;
select the syn@@ tac@@ tic mode for the current file . the list of available flo@@ ats schem@@ es depends on der@@ fl@@ ate ; -@@ version .
&quot; select the type of Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ende identifier . very useful when you use people who use other OS platforms to developers . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
checks the syntax of the document using the selected &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; by means of external application .
&quot; immediate conversion between different types of user interface . due to some limitations in KDE libraries can cause the switch sometimes need time or un@@ nice graphics . recommended , the cart@@ ography mode , which is also the default table mode , which corresponds to the display in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; additionally , this menu contains a entry for each open under@@ window . with a selection of one order the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated . &quot;
&quot; out@@ dated the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the main window , or from . &quot;
&quot; the changes in this dialog box any application that use the K@@ HTML @-@ Part , including the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Web@@ browsers . &quot;
establishes the behavior of the edi@@ tor@@ res . in the documentation of &amp; k@@ ate ; you can find details .
a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bar or which you can add and follow the sequ@@ ences .
&quot; this should generate a help in accordance with the environment of the mouse cursor , but is not yet implemented . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and free , but as with any open source project , the developers can always be used help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find here the way . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ expl@@ ored and should be filled up from top to bottom , as after filling the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will automatically be completed later with shift ; F@@ 7 project project can be set later . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project to enter , for example foo . in the input of name file is automatically filled out . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . by default it has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without space with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you can access the server address of the machine , on which you want to access the local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ un@@ preced@@ .de ) or an IP @-@ address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; lets this field blank , the default settings of the selected prot@@ ocol@@ s will be used . depending on the setting of the remote computer could be an adaptation necessary . &quot;
&quot; that is the folder where the templates will be stored for the project , it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a common collection of files can be used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of standards . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the tool@@ bar is stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bar . if a common collection of files can be used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of standards . &quot;
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . it can be selected multiple files or whole folders .
&quot; this setting is great when you have static web content you download and want to change . if you have any script ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to be different . &quot;
&quot; to be p@@ act if files , which are involved somewhere in the main record of the project . if a project is started on new , not an@@ h@@ ooks . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all the files and folders will be displayed within the main folder and you can make an exact selection of man@@ holes . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main ord@@ ner . you can choose the desired files by an@@ h@@ ooks , or by remo@@ ving the tick , coll@@ ps from the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project assist@@ ants contains three settings that can simplify your work . these settings can upload files in the menu with project properties in the under@@ window profiles or with the keyboard short@@ cut Shift ; F@@ 7 changed .
some settings comply with the project assistant and are described in the project . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of filename ( placement is possible ) that will be re@@ viewing at the project @-@ related operations such as project @-@ related operations .
&quot; compl@@ ementary option to the above , also files that are listed in .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project . &quot;
the project view that will be loaded at the opening of the project . in order to read more about project views .
&quot; with this , the desired deb@@ ug@@ ger can be selected . currently only Gub@@ ed is supported . more information about Gub@@ ed is found in . the deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin can be set with the Options button . in the deb@@ ug tool can be described . &quot;
&quot; in the under@@ window profiles can upload high loading profiles ( see in ) , as well as the display of a construction view for the content of the server for each profile , taking a custom construction for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the under@@ window Team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mail@@ ing list . &quot;
&quot; in the under@@ window event configuration , you can switch an event of events and add these actions , modify or delete . event actions are executed when a previously determined event occurs , such as the sick@@ le of a file . see into the details . &quot;
&quot; by default &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus : the last project , which was opened . this behavior cannot be influenced . &quot;
to open another project you can open project ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will open and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
&quot; if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file will automatically be saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; modified files . the same happens if you load a new project . &quot;
project configuration gives free access to the files in the project . there are the files in the current project .
&quot; folders act as well , however the entries are missing and open with ... in with the right mouse button on the context menu : &quot;
here you can search different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the file .
&quot; allows remo@@ ving the current profile . if only more one profile is present , the button will l@@ ends to prevent the remo@@ ving . &quot;
the password will be kept in the box and do not forget the program . this possibility is useful if frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and that is rather un@@ secure password on the record -@@ option does not come into question .
&quot; this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before the high load . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high drivers are created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) will be uploaded to various servers . when editing or create a profile , this dialog will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; this is the name of the server , to which the files are to be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address function . &quot;
&quot; the trans@@ fer@@ v@@ oll for the up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ IO sl@@ aves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and NFS . &quot;
port for transfer . normally this must not be changed unless the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port .
&quot; depending on your att@@ ending wave this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it according to your discretion . the password is stored on the plate , so it can not be easily read , but each with programming language can be easily seen in the plain text . &quot;
a project view is only one set files and tool@@ bar . it can be loaded in a project a lot of views , i.e. by simple pig@@ ments of view can be loaded multiple files and tool@@ bar and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; views can be stored in the menu project or the project tool , accessible via the tool@@ bar project tool , open or deleted . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to their own working method . &quot;
as mentioned above are the tool@@ bar in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; best known over the menu item tool . use and adding . add tool@@ bar is treated below in the section Ad@@ ding tool .
&quot; the tool@@ bar and symbols may be adjusted either by means of context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , there can be other actions such as tool@@ bar can be executed in dialog , which can be specified in dialog , where actions can be visible on this or other work@@ force . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , the En@@ tries to remove action and action were displayed , the self @-@ explan@@ atory are . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar and the actions on them can set up in the menu with Settings tool , set up ... and Settings actions set .. set . &quot;
&quot; templates are linked in essential tool@@ chain , code car@@ ver and files to link@@ face . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used templates basically like a exercise file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or each on the system available in the deposits . &quot;
&quot; some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions before using any template used before uti@@ liz@@ ing it . &quot;
&quot; now everything does not pure text is . it can be any file except text , so pictures , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; bin@@ ary . bin@@ ary templates are usually included in documents by link@@ ages ( such as images with img src = / src / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the curtains below global templates . further information on the Templates tree is available . &quot;
documents can be created by any text document . normally , you can create new documents for the purpose and organiz@@ es new documents for the purpose and organiz@@ es the work in appropriate way to be efficiently . some examples can be found in the con@@ fis@@ cation of global templates . see in for more information on templates . &quot;
&quot; this kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same tex@@ ture will be inserted again in the documents . you can find everything , from a comment on a final setting up to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl base . see in for more information on templates tree . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates for whole sites as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , in a com@@ pressed t@@ ar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; create a document structure according to Bel@@ i@@ eben ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select file As a template save as a local template .... &quot;
&quot; once this is done , notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) , the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the shop tree under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click on File As a template store , save yourself as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be easily drag@@ ged with a brick and depos@@ iting on the construction site . &quot;
&quot; the creation of bin@@ ary templates is simple : the file is only stored in a pre @-@ storage folder . it can be used all the file administration functions , so write and insert or inser@@ ting over the file tree of con@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can click on a folder in the file tree or in the project files building to create a name for the template and secure a name for the template , but of course it can be stored as local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates allow a very target @-@ oriented element . you can insert head@@ lines and foot@@ er , or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; create files or to connect with them . additionally , you can keep some things when using templates in projects very deeply in mind . &quot;
the submission structure in the under@@ window templates is based on the in $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates and $ HOME / .k@@ en / share / apps / qu@@ anta / trade pic@@ tured files . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers as above .
to specify the behavior of a folder list with right mouse button on the folder and to choose the context menu properties . the following dialog will be displayed :
&quot; a selection field with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is dism@@ is@@ sed as soon as El@@ ter@@ restrial attributes . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and fits all except the regular folders in the pre @-@ storage overview . if a regular folder would generally dis@@ able , unless they would be activated . in case of a normal folder , the bl@@ ah would appear with something like text tree . if nothing appears , you probably is in a master board . &quot;
allows pre@@ defined or updated text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows by copying systems to a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers a whole presentation already with the matching head@@ lines / foot@@ ers .
additionally you have a context menu ( show that right mouse button click ) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another .
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source text editor , which is replaced via the menu item . the first mode is replaced the Edi@@ tor@@ window in two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor . &quot;
the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor works as follows : it is a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or a C@@ urs@@ or appears . then you can edit and when needed to the source code editor in which the changes introduced in the V@@ PL ; Editor in the source code .
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; Editor in a document , the &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . it is not possible to edit this directly using the V@@ PL ; editor . to edit &amp; PHP ; it is still necessary to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode is just as the first one , except that at the same time the changes are activated both in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor , this mode is already active , the keyboard drives the active cursor from one window to the other , whereby the position in the document is ret@@ ained . &quot;
the synchroni@@ zation deri@@ ving between the V@@ PL ; the editor and the source text editor will be able to set forth between synchron@@ isation after one click or automatically . in the selection you can automatically choose the period of time . basically the recommendation applies : a small gap for fast computers and a big sp@@ ans for slow .
supp@@ ose you want to change the title of the website so it is possible to choose the title of the website so it is possible with the V@@ PL ; Editor possible . the document features is also called as soon as a new document is created with V@@ PL ; editor . this is the purpose of the di@@ min@@ ing of the suspension enco@@ ding . this allows you to change the following :
&quot; Meta @-@ Tags , the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . Meta @-@ elements can be added by g@@ aps of the two buttons below or removed . a click into the list allows modification of content , such as key words on the page name and keyword Key@@ words 2 on the content column . &quot;
CSS @-@ rules are the new path of creation of pages in the browser . you can add CSS rules with the buttons under the list or delete . a change about the list is exactly as with the Meta @-@ elements . the editing of CSS rules are currently not yet supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS @-@ style template by opening on the file button and select the corresponding file .
&quot; the use of the cursor is like in a text processing , due to be@@ ating with the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cursor is the cursor . text can be inserted by cor@@ d@@ olls , and deleted by means of feed@@ taste or remove . &quot;
&quot; the Inser@@ ting tags will be done in the same way via the tool@@ bar , as in the source text editor , it &apos;s to be aware that the inser@@ ting of tags previously made existing identical Tags , e.g. if an an@@ chor day , surrounded by text , any other surrounding an@@ chor is removed . &quot;
&quot; some items like the tables assistant or the lists assistant are de@@ activated . you will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; they will be used later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists can be used . &quot;
&amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; is a tool for investigation of styl@@ istic templates . in contrast to other programs for Stil@@ mec@@ ia is possible to find the search for specific elements and the execution of the Stil@@ mec@@ an@@ chor can be pursued .
&quot; um &amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; successfully compile , except &amp; k@@ de ; nor the libraries lib@@ x@@ sl@@ t , li@@ be@@ x@@ sl@@ t and lib@@ xml , which are present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de . &quot;

x@@ sl@@ db@@ g determines the full path from a filename without a p@@ added path . fil@@ en@@ ames in the same folder as the top@@ se@@ ad@@ n Stil@@ mec@@ g is loaded with relative path to the work ord@@ ner con x@@ sl@@ db@@ g . for example a Stil@@ vor@@ es@@ at@@ ei .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l is possible :
&quot; in this command , there is a partial or complete match with a pre@@ age called Q@@ N@@ AME or a specified mod@@ elling sur@@ name . &amp; eg ; template corresponds with each Q@@ N@@ AME , which contains the string template . &quot;
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; Q@@ N@@ AME &quot; will be defined according to the rules described by the title in the X@@ SL source file . X@@ SL : test@@ 1 is extended &amp; eg ; extended to http : / / www.w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1

there are many graphic tools for the compar@@ ing . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain why I wrote .
&quot; the mer@@ ging was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors changes many changes while at the same time has been correc@@ ted . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result were numerous conflicts in the mer@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; the program used by me only showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines . and there was no indications of the places where perhaps only the inhal@@ ation had changed . the mer@@ ging of these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
so that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within a line and changes to white characters . later a lot of other useful functions have been added .
&quot; if you would like to compare your text , simply copy it into the clip@@ board and add it to one of the compar@@ isons . &quot;
a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ ing and mer@@ ging of folders . this function was related &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a complete file browser .
&quot; also 3 @-@ way together , this is fully supported . this is useful when two persons work independently of one piece of co@@ up and make changes at the same time , the original file ( the basis ) helps the result to result in this editor , you can even edit the result . in this editor , you can even edit the result . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot displays three qu@@ ell files in the mer@@ ging : &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you also with the same and assem@@ bling complete folder . this screen@@ shot is showing &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder meeting :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences , and is characterized by the possibilities of active color monitors . if you have to check enco@@ ders frequently , you will like this function . &quot;
&quot; Differences in white characters and tablet are visible . if lines are only different in a certain number of white characters , one can see it at a glance at the summary in the column on the left . ( no hass@@ le more , if Jem@@ and the inhal@@ ation changes . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is equal , and the other is different in a line , then the color indicate which file is different . red color means that both files differ . &quot;
&quot; if all the files have the same name , but in different folders , you can easily get the Ti@@ p@@ par@@ b@@ eit by only the filename of the first file completely . &quot;
k@@ diff@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner
&quot; the opening @-@ dialog allows the manual of file name , the selection of file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a last opened file from the up@@ stream list . you do not need to specify a third file ; if you have to release the entry for C empty , the analysis of the differences with two files will be executed . &quot;
&quot; via the kno@@ b folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the compensation or assem@@ blies is selected , for B and C but a folder , then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the filename from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; when mer@@ ging is crossed , the input field is active for the goal and can process it . however , it is not necessarily required , immediately an output file . you can also take this step later when saving them . &quot;
the set @-@ button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before you start with the same / connection .
&quot; sometimes , you do not want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison begins then immediately . in opening @-@ dialog you do not need to select the dialog with the Cancel button . &quot;
you can also drag and set off : drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
&quot; which thought does it ? sometimes contains a file for example several similar functions . if you want to find out how much these functions are , it would just have two appropriate effort . you have to upload them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; and then download it . now you can easily copy the relevant sections , and then compare . &quot;
note : currently you can do nothing out &amp; k@@ diff@@ ers ; only the case of text into a compar@@ isons is supported .
&quot; warning : some editors interpre@@ t the item and insert text into another program than cutting and paste ( instead of copying and inser@@ ting ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost . &quot;
&quot; in the upper part of each text window , the info line of source window contains the characters A , B or C , the filename and the Z@@ eil@@ enn@@ ants of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional ) , leave the mouse over a file . then a small disk window will display the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three clu@@ sters are the letters A , B and C . a has the colour Blue , B the colour Green and C is mag@@ enta . ( this pre@@ ference can be changed via the Settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when a difference is detected , one sees in the color that file is different . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files . this is in the next section ( mer@@ ging ) good to see . &quot;
&quot; links next to the text is the summary column . if differences were found , the column shows the corresponding color . in case of differences in white characters , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + for example , white signs is only in string chains and comments , for the pre@@ processor and within few , rare species . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line , separ@@ ates the con@@ voy column of text where the respective source file has no lines . if the line @-@ file is activated , the line is displayed in converted lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( under the compar@@ isons ) has also a info line with the wor@@ ding issue : , the filename and &#91; changed &#93; if you have the result is dealt with text , but usually it contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are dis@@ solved , the stor@@ ing is disabled ! ! ! ( use the button jumping to the most sol@@ dered conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two compar@@ isons will be used , each difference is also a conflict which must be resolved manually at the same time . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the window , the second line of the group will be displayed in all windows , and the first line of the group will not be visible . ) This group will then be displayed with the colour background color for current range and each on the left will appear a black beams . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the automatic co @-@ operation or by manual , no further line is left in the group ; then there is only a placement in the case that you change your opinion and perhaps another source . this text does not appear in the final saved file , nor in a mark@@ ings that you might copy and paste . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; combination of quotes , however , appears in the clip@@ board , if you copy of such text from the result window . go carefully with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : if you choose the sources the options ignore or Ig@@ nor@@ iere C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments may also be treated like white characters . &quot;
&quot; navig@@ ated mainly with the image and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are in one of the window , you can use the arrow keys at the beginning , end , Str@@ g @-@ beginning and Str@@ g @-@ end , Si@@ w , as you can also use it from other programs , in addition to the vertical image . &quot;
in the eye @-@ window you can also use the other keys for editing . with the Inser@@ t button you can switch between inser@@ ts and transm@@ itter mode . ( pres@@ et is the inser@@ ting ) . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summar@@ ize columns synchron@@ ised the view of all windows to the top of each group ( as already in the section ) and the edi@@ table aper@@ ture has been declared ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons to navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ image down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ image down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflicts ( Str@@ g @-@ image down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflicts ( Str@@ g @-@ image down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflict . therefore , between sol@@ dering and un@@ resolved conflicts must be signed . &quot;
&quot; to copy the mark@@ ings into the clip@@ board , you need to copy the Copy button ( Str@@ g @-@ C or Str@@ g @-@ Inser@@ ting ) , whatever you select , automatically copied into the clip@@ board and the manual copying falls . be careful with this option , because you could easily over@@ write the content of the clip@@ board . &quot;
Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ders are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system . Unix variants are using a sign @-@ based systems \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems are using W@@ agen@@ en@@ vor@@ b \ \ r \ . K@@ Di@@ ff@@ 3 reserves the source files that you should be &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using bin@@ ary files . &quot;
the options and list of the last used files will be automatically saved and re@@ produced at the next start . ( menu Setting - &gt; K@@ Di@@ ff@@ 3 setup ... )
&quot; select a font with fixed width . ( in some systems , dialogue also provides writ@@ ings with vari@@ ab@@ ler width to choose from , you should not use it . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , are differences in cur@@ ative scrip@@ ture . if the selected Scrip@@ ture does not support this representation does not happen at all . &quot;
&quot; with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be displayed . at these systems the kno@@ b displays automatically an un@@ covered color . &quot;
&quot; when this option is activated , at the g@@ aps of the tab@@ ulator button , the corresponding number of spaces are inserted . otherwise a tab@@ ulator characters will be inserted . &quot;
&quot; if you fill or press Return , the reverse line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; when this option is activated , each selection is automatically copied into the clip@@ board . the manual copy in the clip@@ board . &quot;
you can select which Z@@ eil@@ en@@ coder type you prefer to save . the default value is the generally usual selection on the used operating system .
&quot; while the compar@@ ing of files tried &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all fully identical lines will be ignored in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . in this step white characters are not ignored . even when mer@@ ging the white characters are not ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( in some systems ) save a wrap sign &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , but then you could not save a line of line , but then you may vary depending on different sizes in the side @-@ side @-@ side comparison , however , as a white sign is treated . while mer@@ ging this option must be disabled . in the pres@@ etting this option must be disabled . in the pres@@ etting this option must be disabled . &quot;
&quot; in the default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated signs ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white characters . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , this option is disabled . changes in comments will be treated like changes in white characters . &quot;
&quot; intense after even smaller differences . the option is activated in the default . it is effectively with complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in the automatic res@@ eller mode , this setting determines how long the result of the choice is displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict is continued . &quot;
&quot; solve automatic all conflicts in white characters by selecting the selected file as a source . ( pres@@ et is manual selection . ) , you can take advantage of the functions W@@ ow@@ le A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts in numbers or comments when the options are ignore or Ig@@ nor@@ iere C / C + + comments . &quot;
these options are treated in the chapter on the scanning of folders and execute a mer@@ ging . look for details under documentation on the directory comparison and mer@@ ging .
&quot; when a file is stored and already an older version exists , then the original version is attached to the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if there is already such a back@@ up@@ file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
&quot; the language of the user interface . the modi@@ fying this option does not affect the current program . you must finish and start the change in the KDE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; this option is set in the KDE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; it is not available , because the language is set up on the control center . ) &quot;
the following enco@@ ding settings can be adjusted for each entry separately . if this option is activated for all entries the upper attitude is used .
&quot; on the selection of fields for enco@@ ding appears a short notice , which is the local coding . ( this can not be changed here and has for you purely informal character . ) &quot;
customize the file enco@@ ding for sources files . this influences how special characters treated and interpre@@ t . since the enco@@ ding for each file can be compared and combined files with different enco@@ ding .
&quot; if you have a file , you can specify here which enco@@ ding to save is to be used . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre@@ condition error , they might not work with your co@@ dec . ( e.g. you could handle your files 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ work error messages can only be with 8 @-@ bit ASC@@ II . ) With this option one can set the enco@@ ding of issue of pre@@ matur@@ ation errors . &quot;
&quot; turn this from , to supp@@ ose feedback from changes in white characters in the text or fl@@ aps . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments when the options are ignore or Ig@@ nor@@ iere C / C + + comments . ) &quot;
&quot; this choice is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are shown in a coloured co@@ di@@ still@@ ed side column . but sometimes you would like to see only the differences between two of three files . after selection of A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; &quot;
sometimes you would like to use the available space on the screen rather for long lines . bl@@ ending you simply the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; the compar@@ isons , or over@@ each other . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . ) &quot;
&quot; sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to introduce the files in the mer@@ ging menu , then if you use only two files . a simple click starts to start the mer@@ ging file . ( if this function is used to start the assem@@ ble file , then the name of the last used file will be ret@@ ained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will be handed over to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can customize your own preferences . you can use this function e.g. for a disturb@@ ing parts or correct the obj@@ ection . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it was given first to this external command ( see above ) , then the output of the instruction will be used only when entering the command line . you can write your own preferences . each input line must have a related issue . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind it is to allow users more flexibility in the set @-@ up results . however , an external program requires , and most users would like to program the not self @-@ programming . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l completely eliminated . &quot;
&quot; use this prec@@ urs@@ or error messages , for entering into large letters : sed &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ \ \ \ &apos; . * is a erg@@ ul@@ ary expression of the first cl@@ asp . the \ \ 1 in the first cl@@ asp . the \ \ U conver@@ ts the consolidated text in big letters . &quot;
CV@@ S and other version control systems are used some key@@ words to insert automatically generated string file ( info : / c@@ vs / keyword sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ key \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while you experim@@ enting with sed experim@@ enting , you might start to understand and maybe you like this regular expression even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; the Ig@@ nor@@ ing of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Di@@ ff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of a further pre @-@ working error , and / / g &apos; E@@ ach sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit by nothing , so qu@@ asi is deleted . &quot;
sometimes you may want to perform several classes at once . then you can use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the re@@ plac@@ ements of each other .
instead of sed you can also use something else like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos; s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / switch . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs per@@ l only ( and \ \ ) without the default &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
&quot; the data after the normal pre@@ processor are maintained for display and maintain them . further operations change only the data , which sees the line @-@ line @-@ Al@@ gor@@ yth@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; note : in rare cases , when you use a normal pre@@ processor , the Z@@ eil@@ enab@@ stand sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor command as input . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as in any function , the text changes or differences , you can &apos;t notice certain differences , and in the worst case important data . &quot;
often have to edit programmers in a folder many files . for this reason you can compare with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder re@@ cur@@ sively compared and merge .
... makes for each object a suggestion for assem@@ bling ; you can customize the proposal before starting
... can sim@@ ulate the mer@@ ging and displays those sim@@ ulated changes without having really perform , &quot;
... introduces selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) . &quot;
this is very similar to the same and mer@@ ging of individual files very similar . you have to open only folder on the command line or in the dialog box .
&quot; when three folder will be mer@@ ged , then folders will be used as a base . if no goal is specified , uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; Ord@@ ner@@ 3 as target ner . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not the combination . to launch the mer@@ ging , you must click the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder will inform you a small message shop over the current progress . if you hit the folder in the folder , the files will be listed , which were compared until then . &quot;
&quot; when the folder is finished , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a drop @-@ window with the results on the left side , ... &quot;
each file and each folder will be found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is normally summar@@ ized . you can click a folder by clicking the + / - click on the + / - clicking on the + / - and see all sub@@ directories with which you can find all the folders and folders .
&quot; click on one file , the file will be started and it will appear a comparison window . &quot;
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detailed window to the selected object . in such a case the inter@@ mitt@@ ing action can not be automatically chosen , you will be informed about problems of this kind . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the above picture , are in the columns A / B / C the colours red , green , yellow and black . &quot;
&quot; with identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
&quot; folders will be identical as identical when their entire content is identical . then also folder the same color . in folders , the age is in@@ significant for its colour . &quot;
&quot; the idea to this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colours of a leaf@@ y again , which is only green , then yellow will be and later , if it is old , red . &quot;
... A and C are identical but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
&quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy from A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a , B and C do not have the same data type ( e.g. if a folder and B a file is ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tive data types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects can not be started . &quot;
... A and B not have the same data type ( e.g. if a folder and B a file is ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tory data types . long as such faul@@ ty objects can not be started .
&quot; the mode to synchroni@@ ze is active if only two folder and no explicitly indicated , and if the option is synchroni@@ ze . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action is identical , so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ... &quot;
&quot; a and B exist , but not identical are : together and the result in both folders . ( the user sees as the visible filename for the output file only B ; right after the assem@@ ble copies &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. ) &quot;
&quot; when two folder will be mer@@ ged and select the re@@ ere file instead of composition ( un@@ sure ) enabled , then the date of the files are different , but the same date is identical , but the date is identical .. of such errors are not removed , the mer@@ ging of the folder can not be started . &quot;
&quot; while mer@@ ging will display a file after another . you have Status column shows Fer@@ ry , and accordingly more messages if something un@@ expected occurred . if the mer@@ ging is completed , you should make a last review and see if the status is right in order . &quot;
&quot; if in the setup dialog the file compar@@ ative method is selected , K@@ Di@@ ff@@ 3 . these included the number of un@@ resolved , sol@@ dering , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for dis@@ solved conflicts will be displayed only if three folder is compared or combined ) . &quot;
&quot; you can either run the currently selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the mer@@ ging actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can launch the mer@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you have not specified destination , then in the three @-@ folder mer@@ ging mode C as the goal is chosen and synchroni@@ zing yourself as the destination and can be used while synchroni@@ ze A and / or B as a destination . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination , please check if all entries must be displayed in the target structure , also in the folder structure , there are some options that could be covered by certain entries . check these options to avoid un@@ happy sur@@ prises . &quot;
to perform all entries : select directory launch / continue in directory / menu or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard short@@ cut ) . to perform only the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if due to contra@@ dic@@ tory file types there still exist un@@ equal mer@@ ging actions appears a message appears on the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
&quot; if you perform all entries , a dialog box will appear with the options , sim@@ ulating and Cancel . &quot;
&quot; choose if you only want to see what would happen , without the really changes are done . you will then get a detailed list of all promotions . &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then certain actions required with all entries . if a manual procedure is necessary ( merge a single file ) then opens a mer@@ ging window ( see the screen@@ shot ) .
&quot; if you are ready with a file , select the directory launch / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved , a corresponding dialogue . then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ ers , appears a message and detailed state @-@ of information . at the conclusion of the list you will be able to re@@ vis@@ e the cause of the problem ( F@@ 7 key ) , lets you choose the cause of the problem or solve the problem of the problem or solve the problem in other way before proce@@ eding with the mer@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been combined individually , remember &amp; k@@ diff@@ ers , this entries ( in the current session ) , and execute them in later together . even if you have entered the mer@@ ges , these entries have been considered . only if you change the mer@@ ging action , these entries will be mer@@ ged again . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ Di@@ ff@@ 3 setup ... ) now has a section called directory @-@ se@@ duction with these options :
only files that are shown on the specified pattern are displayed in the panel tree . separate the pattern with a semi@@ col@@ on ; . valid placement : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
files and folders correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the el@@ ementary tree . it can be displayed more than a pattern ; use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ates . valid Plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the el@@ ementary tree . it can be displayed more than a pattern ; use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ates . valid Plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that are also ignored by CV@@ S . many autonom@@ ous products are ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder can be set with a .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some fil@@ esyst@@ ems , files have a file attri@@ bute . in other file systems , one file marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the el@@ ementary tree or not . this option is swit@@ ched in the default . &quot;
&quot; when links on files : if the option is swit@@ ched , symbo@@ lic link@@ ages compared . if the option is swit@@ ched , the files are compared to which the links show . this is de@@ activated in the default . &quot;
&quot; when links to folder : if the option is swit@@ ched , the symbo@@ lic Links are compared . if the option is swit@@ ched on , the links like normal folder will be treated and recur@@ sively out@@ fit . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ ers lead . a link to a folder of itself would lead to a final loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; turbul@@ ent . ) This option is swit@@ ched in the pre@@ setting . &quot;
&quot; a complete analysis of each file by and displays statistics of columns , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slow as a simple bin@@ ary analysis , and much s@@ lower when they are applied to files which does not contain text . ( give an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folder through a slow network , it may possibly be faster , only the amendments date and the file size . please use caution . please use caution . this option is stored in the default . &quot;
similar to VER@@ TR@@ AU@@ E to change date . there is no real comparison instead of . the files are considered identical if they are identical . this can be useful for example when copying the change of lost time . please use caution . this option is stored in the default setting .
activ@@ ating the synchroni@@ zing mode if two folder is compared and no destination specified . in this mode the proposals are described as well . also the results of the mer@@ ging of files are stored in both folders . this option is stored in the default file .
&quot; if there are differences , will be proposed instead of the combination of the newer file as action . ( this is considered un@@ sure that the other file has not been modified . you should check this in any case . ) This option is stored in the pre@@ setting . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder will be replaced or deleted , the original version will be ren@@ amed and the extension .@@ inline . if an old backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension has already exists , so this without further backup will also apply this option , this option is swit@@ ched into the default folder . this option is swit@@ ched in the default . &quot;
normally the Fol@@ der @-@ associated view lasts from the combination of individual files ; you can move the window frames using the mouse . if you do not want to switch the window &amp; text window to switch the window in window menu and switch between a directory &amp; text window between the two views .
&quot; probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ clicking . nevertheless , you can launch a single file folder , without only the folder menu . once you use the result , the status will be set down and the file will not run once again if you run the folder . &quot;
&quot; however , this status will be lost if you want to read the directory : new directory : new &quot;
KDE supports network transparent with the help of K@@ IO sl@@ aves . K@@ Di@@ ff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders for opening that are located on local or remote machines .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a com@@ pressed Archives with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax to local files and folders . a few things should be noted :
&quot; a path can be relatively und@@ ed . or .. included . this is not possible with URLs not possible , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special marks must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , Leer@@ sum &gt; % 20 , etc . example ) . for example has a file called / # foo # the URL file : / % 23@@ foo % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the fil@@ esyst@@ em on the server , sometimes through the used protocol . it follows a brief list of constra@@ ints : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be signed , whether a link is displayed on a file or folder . then there is always a file as a link target . ( FTP : , SF@@ TP : ) . &quot;
there is no possibility to process auth@@ orization or change of the date . therefore the entit@@ lement or change of the original from . ( note this option VER@@ TR@@ AU@@ E of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
&quot; the main purpose of use is currently being the differences in K@@ Devel@@ op . K@@ Devel@@ op will first start the built @-@ in differences . to create K@@ di@@ ff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the differences and then select In K@@ Di@@ ff@@ 3@@ Part show off the context menu . &quot;
&quot; normally , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . if it is applied as being K@@ part , takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . then one of the two files must exist . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the con@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ Di@@ ff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if any of the original files exists . moreover , this is un@@ reliable when the original files has changed since the generation of the patch file . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it supports only the compar@@ ing of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . the mer@@ ging or the same of folders will not be supported in the K@@ Part mode . &quot;
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Di@@ ff@@ 2 ( now you are comp@@ ose ) there are already . moreover , the name K@@ Di@@ ff@@ 3 already indicates that it can bring together like the program diff@@ ers from the Di@@ ff tool collection . &quot;
I use GPL @-@ programs already very long and I learned a lot of learned in the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programmers who have taken this path or going to go .
&quot; you have compiled the program from the sources and the configure script should not be shared with the proper pre@@ fix for KDE . in the pres@@ et installed configure , in / usr / local , but then KDE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ ADM@@ E file you find more information on this subject . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical ; if there is only a non @-@ white characters , the line will be treated as not identical . if it is not identical to each other , this is is obj@@ dence but this case is both the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor will remember all the difference in the files where he begins and where it ends . this important information does not be able to solve a conflict by clicking on the source text and selecting the button A / B / C , it is a lot of effort to dism@@ iss an own file format that could store this information . &quot;
the effort was too big . you can restore a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C / C / C . to process larger amounts of text should be used another editor .
&quot; after remo@@ ving text is suddenly lt ; no pro@@ bes , appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does it mean and how can it be removed ? &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ ers already used many colors to distinguish from differences . even more shut@@ ters would be conf@@ using and l@@ acks the purpose . use this for another editor .
many good ideas and troub@@ les came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
&quot; to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ ers , you need &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer . &quot;
information on how to use K@@ Di@@ ff@@ 3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage .
a list of the latest changes can be found at http : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ source@@ forge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the file folder .
&quot; to compile and install &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution : &quot;
KDE @-@ you are installed the folder in your system in which KDE is installed . if you are un@@ sure you will find further details in the RE@@ ADM@@ E file .

cut ( Str@@ g @-@ X or Shift Del@@ ete ) copied into the clip@@ board and delet@@ es the selected text . insert ( Str@@ g @-@ V or Shift inser@@ tion ) adds the text from the clip@@ board to the current cursor position or replace the current mark@@ ings .
&quot; only Differences : files that are identical in all folders are not appear in folder structure , and consequently not in the destination folder . &quot;
( in the current program version you need to introduce changes to these options to the folder with the function Update . )
&quot; it will only show entries indicated that identi@@ fying the differences . in case the target ner may not already be copied into the target folder . if the target folder will not already be copied , they are missing in a later program version . ) This option is swit@@ ched in the default version . ) This option is swit@@ ched in the default version . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to choose from the source with the labelling A , B and C below the menu bar . if you are attached to one of the rows ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed by clicking on the button . &quot;
&quot; in the default , this option is disabled . Under@@ differences in individual symbols ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , shows a thumb@@ nail of all virtual working spaces . it is quite convenient to see the running programs in the working areas to change their size , to finish it or to move it . this works both within a desktop and several . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ spaces , as well as the applications of running applications . the applications can be selected and even moving on the desktop and another . &quot;
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . the movement is possible both within a desktop and other working areas . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is click on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , then the context menu has been cli@@ cked , only the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minim@@ ize , maxim@@ ize , on desktop and ending . the commands will make the following : &quot;
maxim@@ izing the use window on the full size of the desktop . appears only when it was cli@@ cked on an application .

&quot; this medication is marked , can be moved window within the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also post@@ pon@@ ed on other work areas . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , are displayed in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the names of virtual working spaces are displayed . &quot;
&quot; wat@@ ert@@ ed this field leaves the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of virtual working spaces are displayed , the names with Ord@@ inary are provided , &amp; eg ; 1 working space . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also shown as background in the background . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the running programs will be displayed as a small window in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . otherwise , only the empty working spaces are displayed in order to enable their selection . &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rectangular with the pro@@ portions of the program window . symbol displays the windows with its standard symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program . remark : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
&quot; here , the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ box will be determined : classic leaves &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n @-@ button , like from P@@ ager applications in some other Window@@ management ; wa@@ agre@@ es shows all virtual jobs in a horizontal and vertical sequence , which is very well suited for the representation on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager Mini@@ program in the control bar . it has the advantage that he can display in the size , the windows as symbols or with their content . furthermore it runs out of the control bar . &quot;
click the right mouse button in the button of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent can select ... lets dialogue settings appear .
currently this can not be changed in the dialog settings you can do this but manually done :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ er@@ c with any tex@@ te@@ di@@ tor such as &amp; k@@ edit ; or VI@@ . if you do not need to register as a user root or login to your system administrator . in this file you need to register the key window@@ Transpar@@ ent@@ Mode and to this one value . possible values are :
da &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package is you need a functional installation of KDE package packages .

&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended by new features . it is optimized for use on high @-@ efficient machines .
&quot; if you like &amp; k@@ mag ; start a window like above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; indicates the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window appears as a magni@@ fication window , is a enlarged field of the screen and is referred to as a selection window . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse po@@ inter as an mov@@ able L@@ upe . alternatively , you can add a selected screen range in enlar@@ ging window ) or the surroundings of the mouse cursor on the screen ( eg ; on the left of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; would you like to avoid that the mouse po@@ inter is represented in the enlarged window , select the setting mouse po@@ inter . please note that &amp; k@@ mag is still not able to recognize the form of the mouse cursor . this is always the standard @-@ k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse @-@ po@@ inter . &quot;
&quot; in the selection mode , you can customize the selection window to suit your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouth @-@ box and change its size . this can be done in the following ways : &quot;
move the mouse po@@ inter in enlarge and keep the left mouse button pressed so you can catch the content of the magni@@ fication and move . this goes also with the arrow keys .
&quot; if you additionally press &amp; Shift ; taste or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can move the selection window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination you can change the size of the selection window , please note that the upper left corner of the selection window will be firm and only the lower right corner is to move . &quot;
&amp; k@@ mag ; features a lot of functions . you can copy the enlarged image directly to the printer to copy it into the clip@@ board ( to turn later in other applications ) to turn the picture and much more .
starts or stops the update of the display . the update of the update causes the required CPU @-@ time against 0 .
&quot; select the actu@@ alization rate ( Very small , Ger@@ ing , means , ho@@ ch , Very high ) . the higher the actu@@ alization rate , the more CPU @-@ time is needed . &quot;
in this mode a selection window will display . the selected area is displayed in a window .

&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse @-@ click , once the cursor takes a while on the same place har@@ ness . it is thought to help people who prepar@@ es at the Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and those who post@@ ulate the mouse . this requires a bit of exercise . however , this requires little practice . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain , which comes in clicking the mouse and helps so many people who are used to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you can also connect to pain the use of your computer , should you have a doctor if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to place it once again : even if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain helps to be caused by clicking with the mouse , it is against pain , which is caused by using the mouse , us@@ eless . and as with all ergonomic tools : the result can be consumed for each differently . &quot;
&quot; the use of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitor your mouse movements and performs a mouse @-@ click , as soon as you break the movement shortly . &quot;
&quot; is the intelligent shi@@ fts activated , making &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after it is run until the end of the movement , the slogan of the mouse button is run . in this way you can run the mouse button again . this intelligent amplifier requires a little practice , but you get used quickly to it . &quot;
this con@@ fes@@ tive period has to hide after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse @-@ click .
&quot; is Intellig@@ ent multip@@ lier , will be active in the screen@@ shot time ( 1 / 10 s ) active . here the time is set up , the &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after the flo@@ ating mouse button wa@@ its before it does not let the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports clicking on the right and back , followed by a break , followed by a break , a click with the right mouse button . a down@@ hill . these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt . the first time will be started , but they can change later . &quot;
&quot; when the sound is del@@ ayed , you can move &amp; k@@ de ; to open the reaction time . open the sound system and here the rider General . there is a sli@@ der sound @-@ buffer that you are looking at a lower value to shor@@ ten the answers . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , is run &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available . this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available for the respective documentation to rate , to find out how you will automatically start a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; puts all settings on the values , which were adjusted when opening the dialogue , you have already printed the button after the last g@@ aps of application . &quot;
&quot; the best use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first use the pre @-@ settings . in particular , the intelligent move should be swit@@ ched at first . if you have access to the automatic mouse click , you can later move the smart feed . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the answers from &amp; k@@ de ; for sounds too . &quot;
&quot; first , you should be aware of which places a mouse @-@ click without effect remains : the click on the neutr@@ ality of windows or in places in the browser window , which does not represent a link does not lead to un@@ expected reactions . you can therefore use the mouse in such places until you would like to use it again . &quot;
&quot; if your mouse clicks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the tri@@ ck is that you do not only clean the mouse @-@ ball , but also the roles that come into touch with the mouse . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to remove the mouse ball . how this happens , is different from mouse to mouse . it should be quickly clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have the ball you would have to see the roles . these are in the sides of the Lo@@ ches , into which the ball was used . the Dre@@ ck and the dirty , you can easily settle with a flat blade or the fingers . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system inter@@ rup@@ ts the operating system the execution of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use this smart for@@ ew@@ ing tool , that means that &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the surgery no longer can end through the slogan of the mouse . &quot;
this happens if you use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; using another window manager and move a window .
the solution to this problem lies that you can execute yourself a mouse @-@ click . this is the status of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and you can continue as usual .
&quot; problem : if you enter text , tries &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and set the cursor to another place . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cursor to place where you want it . however , you don &apos;t want to bring it into a neutral area of the desktop , if you want to create a key@@ stro@@ kes . safe zones for the mouse @-@ cursor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bar and menus and the title of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the intelligent move , but I don &apos;t have to edit it with this text . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent conc@@ ept@@ ance is an advanced function of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time to copy it into the clip@@ board , or to insert it into the clip@@ board , or to add any other promotion , when you want to move the mouse in the clip@@ board . but it will probably be able to prepare it once again . here are some advice to this : &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t use the smart for@@ ew@@ ing tool , if you just use it just before starting &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; simply highlight text instead of the mouse button , while keeping the mouse button on the other end of the text and once again pressing the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this makes every time when &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button pressed up a sound like a mouse @-@ click . so , you can use the intelligent amplifier without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , it requires some exercise . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; you must be installed , the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Window ; this should be the case in most system . &quot;
&quot; the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available , if the system features a sound@@ card and speaker . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pra@@ ying the mouse button once the mouse @-@ cursor is short har@@ v@@ eil@@ ed . this program was developed for people who are suffering at R@@ SI syndrome and those that prepar@@ es the fast@@ ing of the mouth pain . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured as a certain time is waiting that a rough operation begins , before the mouse is released . this way can also be releas@@ ing and depos@@ iting with the mouse . &quot;

the main window of &amp; km@@ outh ; is clear and contains essentially an input field for the key@@ stro@@ kes of your pro@@ positions ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a Fig @-@ memory of the already noted pro@@ positions ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
&quot; if you have indicated in the text@@ field , you can enter into the input field , you can hear the pro@@ positions that you want to hear . each sc@@ ored phr@@ ase is attached to the finishing memory . you can choose from it , which should be talked again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry settings , setup ... open the inser@@ tion dialog by &amp; km@@ outh ; this dialog contains two boxes , voice output and settings , the side of Wor@@ ding , as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the map , you enter the command to call the language @-@ generator . in the selection field below the input field , you specify the character code , with the text on the language generator will be distributed . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ outh ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the cross @-@ panel , when the text remains unchanged as standard delivery to the voice generator . &quot;
&quot; if the cross@@ roads is not selected , the text is given as parameters . you can use the following placement : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command on language version depends on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation for your language generator . examples of this command can be found in the App@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; with as a language service life &amp; km@@ outh is used as the first attempt to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the other settings will be available on this page and which is currently being developed in SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection of action , according to the selection of a text collection , you determine what action is trig@@ gered by the keyboard short@@ cut or through the choice of a text box in the menu text box , or in the brush for text@@ box . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of so@@ fort , the chosen text was placed directly and additionally entered into the storage box . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text was entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second selection panel of the processing item for text pass@@ agen@@ ers , you can specify whether the text log@@ book will be automatically saved when closing the machining process . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of text pass@@ agen@@ buch , the book is saved . if you do not select changes , the text pass@@ agen@@ book will not be saved . select Save as if the text message is to be saved . &quot;
&quot; the page wor@@ ding in the main window contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; km@@ outh , when this list contains more than a dictionary . with this sel@@ ective field , you can choose the currently used dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons on the right you can delete words or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , or to export them into a file . below the list you can adjust the name and in the selection field the language for the dictionary . &quot;
select for this source the desired language ; &amp; km@@ s. reads the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ documentation a . the frequency of the individual words will be determined simply by the count of the adv@@ ancement . additionally you can insert the wor@@ ding list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.org dictionary to insert it just right written words into the new dictionary .
&quot; with this option you can summar@@ ize the dic@@ tion@@ aries of dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; km@@ s. asks , which dic@@ tion@@ aries are mer@@ ged , and how it should be weight@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; with this option you place a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; km@@ ar ; new entered words automatically into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your voc@@ abulary . &quot;
the main area of the window for the processing of text pass@@ ag@@ lo@@ ops is divided up . in the upper part the text box are presented as tree structure .
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected item . if you have selected a text collection , you can change the text@@ text or the related keyboard short@@ cut . if you have selected a text box , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; actions such as new text pass@@ ages or books add or selected text pass@@ ages and books you can either delete the selection from the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a folding menu . &quot;
the order of text pass@@ ag@@ ull or tex@@ pass@@ ages you can change by clicking with the mouse to the new place or with the arrow keys and the &amp; old ; -@@ key .

&quot; Festival is a language version of the Edinburgh University . currently , only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh is supported . the license allows it to use festival for free and dis@@ semin@@ ated without restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up the language version , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the folder / usr / local / festival . the command to language version is then : &quot;
Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; used language generator . currently he only supports the English language . the license allows it to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and without any restrictions .
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up the language version , is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ etts is then possible with one of the three following commands : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be swit@@ ched as standard delivery . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of phon@@ emen in a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional programme to set the text in phon@@ eme . the license allows it to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax used to convert the German text in phon@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , among the as@@ sumption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / ha@@ di@@ fax and / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax would like to be the last sign of the text , so that an additional character must be attached . the full command is therefore more elabor@@ ate than in the other examples : &quot;
( Cat - ; echo quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / ha@@ di@@ fax / t@@ xt@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / de@@ 1 / / mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / f@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in a line . the option is required to be swit@@ ched as default .

&quot; as the attitude of the language @-@ generator will only be done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you must only use as a language service as a language service . &quot;
&quot; to adjust the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which is displayed in the dialog dialog by &amp; km@@ outh ; will be installed if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; km@@ s. successful , you need a language : ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; km@@ s. needed approximately 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but depends in detail on your computer and its configuration . &quot;

&quot; filter for string replacement , a good option in &amp; kt@@ ts ; is wrong , or faul@@ ty messages to correct . the file is mail@@ ed , is a good example . you removed the tags , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , since this in most cases can be accepted as required . read it also . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced abilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; are filters not required .
&quot; in Fil@@ ters , text is processed , he will be sent to the program Speech disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving the language , to select incorrect words or abbrevi@@ ations , or to handle certain short@@ com@@ ings of voice @-@ syn@@ thesi@@ ology and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the working method of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; Speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; diff@@ ers four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ ers has the highest priority . it will be drawn to all other orders and keeps these orders . if the output of the screen reader , the attached orders will be continued again . &quot;
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; Proc@@ essor will be reserved for hot . one warning has priority and keeps the output from news and normal text . these orders are continued after the output of warning .
News have the neighb@@ our priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; km@@ outh ; is an example of an application that can be used . during you &amp; eg ; a long text on a website you can welcome to the room . &amp; k@@ de ; notifications are also News . read about it .
&quot; the rest are simple tex@@ ture . each order , which is used by the map card orders , is a text assignment . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of applications that have been used for the issue of longer texts , which have no special ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four orders are processed in queue , except for the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application the output of a screen Re@@ aders , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such reads , this issue will be raised and termin@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ ers . you will be applied to regular war@@ nings , news and tex@@ tions as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News . &quot;
filter edit the text and enter it on the next filter . at the moment there are three types of filters .
filters are done as modules . in the future there can be further types of filters .
&quot; string samples re@@ placing parts of a text by other text . the parts , you can specify either as a word or as a regular expression . &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is supplied by text or for the form@@ atting of messages from &amp; kon@@ versation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better comprehen@@ sible form . &quot;
&amp; XML ; -@@ Um@@ former use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to a different format ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files to the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
&quot; with microphone extr@@ actors , you can send orders depend on the contents of the text or depending on the program that can send the text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; if you have a female voice , you can send text from KDE @-@ news about the result . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters has adjustable rules , according to which it is applied to a language version . if the filter is defined , he does not coinci@@ de the text unchanged to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; when a text entry , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification , it is processed by all active filters that were shown on the page below . the processing is done in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this displays the list of the furnished normal filters . is a filter not crossed , it is not activated and is not used . filters are shown in line up from top to bottom . &quot;
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter and it will be shown below the following combinations .
&quot; for setting up string samples , you must enter a list of words or regular expres@@ sions as a compar@@ ative pattern . these patterns in text will be found , then the text against the corresponding replacement text is ex@@ changed . large and inf@@ ancy is not observed when compared to . &quot;
enter your filter a name for your filter . you can choose to choose any number you just need to distinguish yourself from the names of the other filters .
&quot; this is the list of words and regular expres@@ sions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the string chains in column , and replaced him in accordance with the string column . the list is shown in the sequence from top to bottom . &quot;
click here to move the marked word or the regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can upload a list of words or regular expres@@ sions from a file , the current list store or delete . Download a list from a file , the entries will be attached to the available list . &quot;
&quot; is here a language entered here , the filter is only applied when the spok@@ es@@ man speaks one of the languages listed here . you can also select several languages if you click on the mouse @-@ click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; button pressed . &quot;
&quot; here is a value registered , the filter is used only when the text is used by one of the specified applications . you can type multiple programs separated by comm@@ ent@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
the application ID run programs can be obtained with the q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ bus ; -@@ numbers must be taken away . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application @-@ ID kop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you may only be copied . &quot;
the string samples used will only be applied to the text if all the terms with an entry in the box does not apply if required . all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; when comparison of words used the character , processing filter regular expression in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words need to be limited by divi@@ des ( space ) . &quot;
&quot; in this hand@@ book you will find no instructions for writing regular expres@@ sions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; phrases can be found in the package k@@ deu@@ ti@@ ls . &quot;
&amp; XML ; -@@ Um@@ former translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from a format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such revers@@ als . it can only be applied to well @-@ shaped XML . the system program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the ambi@@ ent variable PAT@@ H is also enough x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; with the microphone socket you can send text to a specific speaker , which is set up on the map card , or to a speaker with specific properties . you can define for example , that texts from k@@ mail should be read from a female voice . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text to the filter is seeking it a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected by the spok@@ es@@ person , which gives the text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; send the text on the map @-@ card speaker . with the speaker cable , you can re@@ write the selected speaker . &quot;
&quot; here is a value registered , the filter is used if the text does not contain the given regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; to click , you can click this by clicking on the button to get help with input . &quot;
&quot; to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anch@@ ored the regular expression at the beginning of the string chain , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; Set here the properties of the microphone . if the text shown above shown filter conditions , the speaker will be selected , the speaker is selected to display the desired requirements on the test . click on the button on the right to display the dialog box . &quot;
use this button to save or download your microphone settings or to delete all settings .
the Interphone filter is only applied to the text if all the terms with an entry in the box of the box does apply if applicable . you must enter at least a condition .

&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; that &apos;s the program Speech disp@@ at@@ cher uses . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is to be developed so further that the establishment of speech disp@@ at@@ cher can be directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
&quot; a long text is set into single pro@@ positions . the user can proceed to or retri@@ ev@@ ing them , repeat the output or Cancel . &quot;
&quot; if an application is subject to &amp; kt@@ ts ; however , it can specify the properties of the preferred language speaker for the output . so if you want to choose a speaker , whose language English and his sex is used , otherwise , it is automatically chosen by the best appropriate speaker . if you choose more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker is chosen , see you in after . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the map card speakers , and thus click on the list or click Edit , the map &apos;s card set is shown . as an example will be shown below the setup of the module for festival Interactive . details of the modules are shown below . &quot;
enter the path to the exec@@ utable Fes@@ tiv@@ al@@ program . if the path is included in PAT@@ H you need to enter only festival .
&quot; select the character enco@@ ding for text , which is handed over to the festival , this setting is automatically made . general , this setting is automatically made . general , the Western language ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 use , eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak , ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these sli@@ ders , you put volume , talk vel@@ ocity and clay level of the synthe@@ tic language . if you can not select some shelves and that grey can not be displayed , the voice chosen by you chosen these settings . &quot;
&quot; some voices such as Multi@@ Sy@@ n votes may require multiple seconds to be loaded due to its size several seconds . if you loaded this folder , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so ( for maximum memory consumption ) , the first set of quick@@ er is syn@@ thesi@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; if this address cannot be selected , you have not set up a speaker ( or forget to apply ) . see . &quot;
&quot; this medication is marked , is shown at the start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr the program window display . otherwise , after starting only the symbol is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; this is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ ell is not yet running it , appears in the system range , as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD will have a text reads . this allows you to control the option or to control your own . &quot;
&quot; here are all orders listed in queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of pro@@ positions and the currently processed sentence . the spok@@ es@@ man corresponds to the column ID on the map card speaker . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series you can specify exactly in the order that is selected in the list below , prior to or go back . ( but not every order consists of several movements ) . &quot;
&quot; with a click on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other map cards ) are adopted and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is shown to the symbol in the system section . then click this icon to view the program window . &quot;
&quot; when the Sound@@ system &amp; arts , is not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stream@@ er or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the map audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; here , only text files are listed and managed . expenditure of Screen Re@@ a@@ ers , war@@ nings and messages are not displayed . further information on the communication types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; can be found in . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio output . if a component can not be selected , has been compiled &amp; stri@@ ts ; either without support for the corresponding audi@@ om@@ o@@ dul , or &amp; kt@@ ts ; the necessary libraries can not load . &quot;
if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list you need to install at least one module . do not choose the PC@@ M device . see also the PC@@ M device . see also
&quot; Set the talk rate here . 50@@ h ; % corresponds to approximately half and 200@@ ,000 % approximately the double normal microphone speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x . &quot;
click to apply to take the new settings for the current &amp; desktop system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules which are installed in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out which device can work with you . in the case choose standard .
&quot; on this map , you can create special actions that will always be executed when the text is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of language orders : &quot;
&quot; the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ ers has the highest priority . it will be submitted to all other orders and keeps these orders . after the output of the screen reader , the attached orders will be recorded again . &quot;
war@@ nings have priority here . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; Proc@@ essor will be reserved for hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are continued after the warning of warning .
&quot; News have the next priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; km@@ outh ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you have a long text on a website , you can welcome you with &amp; km@@ outh ; nevertheless someone welcome the room . &quot;
&quot; will a text assignment by a message , warning or the output of a screen Re@@ aders , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the queue . &quot;
this audio file will always be played when a normal tex@@ ture will be interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound as well as introduc@@ tory message will be played by the introduc@@ tory sound in front of the un@@ equal message .
&quot; the settings on this map @-@ card apply only for normal text files . for messages , war@@ nings and the issues of Screen Re@@ a@@ ers there are no special promotions when they can be interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to leave with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ Noti@@ fy @-@ Current News , start t@@ sm@@ gr and click notifications . the card @-@ card notification appears . &quot;
&quot; select this folder to switch the body of &amp; k@@ de ; Noti@@ fications , this setting is not marked , the remaining settings are de@@ activated and &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads no notification . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , notification of which a sound is played , of &amp; kt@@ ts ; not yet read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add events to the list or remove it . if you click on the button Add , a dialog will appear in which you want to add the application and event that you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event will read the message before , the &amp; con@@ versation ; sent when anyone mentioned in a IR@@ C message from your nickname . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which in the list nothing else is stated , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; use this selection field to set what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do if an event is inv@@ iting , you have the following choices : &quot;
&quot; if you have selected user defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following placement : &quot;
you can enter the characteristics of the desired speaker . Standard select the speaker that is shown on the list on the card speaker as the upper entry is displayed . see you too .
&quot; note that there are three levels of events that there are three levels for events . otherwise , this action is executed for any particular event of a particular application . otherwise the action is scheduled for all other events of the particular application . as the last way the action comes to Tr@@ agen , which was determined under standard ( all other events ) . &quot;

&quot; the Speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for the control of votes , the talk speed , the volume of voice and the clay level . furthermore brands for controlling the language of the voice and the clay level . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard . &quot;
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partly and only in the basic functions . following restrictions are available :
&quot; you have to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) , as this is the default voice , the festival in the output of SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or tone in the Festival configuration dialog does not apply to 100@@ th % , SS@@ ML Text is usually issued very mon@@ ot@@ on . &quot;
&lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; enco@@ ding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; &quot; &gt; &lt; !

&quot; there are two types of filters , normal filters and con@@ ceptual form@@ ulations ( SD@@ T filter ) . SB@@ Ds do not contain text into single pro@@ positions . this allows you to begin with the first sentence , not the whole text . this allows you to jump or stop and break down , even if the language syn@@ thesizer this is not directly supported . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the set of recogni@@ zing filter . when the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , will automatically set up a proposition sign @-@ line filter . you can change its settings or add further pro@@ portions of recogni@@ z@@ able filters , but it will be dem@@ ol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; the easi@@ est way you learn to try out the consultation of the microphone selection . place the microphone selection , change the spok@@ es@@ person , change the spok@@ es@@ person , change some characteristics and consider how the selection of the microphone changes . in addition , you need to have more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; when the first sentence can be processed as only the first sentence has to be processed , and not the whole text block , which can last very long , &quot;
you can then keep text files at the card card orders or break down if the language syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
&quot; for these reasons the normal proposition sign up is automatically set up , if you start t@@ t@@ sm@@ gr for the first time . it can not be swit@@ ched , only removed . change nothing in this filter , unless you know what you do . &quot;
proposition sign text with a regular expression for proposition and add a tablet mark ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) in the pro@@ posi@@ tional sign ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) in the pro@@ posi@@ tional sign ( dec@@ lines automatically removed from the text ) . note that the standard set of recogni@@ zing filter the character sets .
&quot; SB@@ D filters will never be applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ messages ( k@@ illing ) , war@@ nings , messages or the output of Screen Re@@ production . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed from Ver@@ see the normal proposition sign , you can insert it again by clicking the file in &amp; kt@@ ts ; included file standard _ sb@@ dr@@ c . &quot;
on the map card holder enables you to over@@ write the microphone settings for the application . the card card is displayed when
use of the standard report ( the top on the cart@@ on card ) . in other words : there will be no microphone properties .
&quot; use of the matching microphone , which shows all the properties of a furnished microphone . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the microphone , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; this speaker . otherwise , sel@@ ects &amp; kt@@ ts , which corresponds to the speaker . &quot;
select the method to enter the desired microphone properties by clicking on one of the selection heads .
&quot; select the characteristics of the desired speaker . if this property does not play a role , do not give anything . &quot;
&quot; select this folder , if the property should have preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also put several mark@@ ings here . &quot;
&quot; as the language is a critical factor when using the issue , this is always treated as a priority property . you will never use this property . the only event that you may want to indicate that particular application text in a different language than in working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all properties in the field of speakers , use the following to the following , click on the selection of standard speakers and then use to speaker who is on the test of the following . &quot;
&quot; in this case , 0 for the last text entry in queue . you can also specify a order number . ( no order number is required 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr stor@@ ms immediately when it is started . I have been compiled deb@@ ug support , but I do not get any feedback . &quot;
G@@ Stream@@ er is dism@@ is@@ sed and &amp; kt@@ ts ; perhaps you must register G@@ Stream@@ er 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command g@@ st register register . if the problem is not solved by G@@ Stream@@ er . you can attempt G@@ Stream@@ er to update or un@@ install G@@ Stream@@ er .
&quot; the audio @-@ edition about AL@@ SA does not work , when I start playing with another application music . when I insert a text entry , fri@@ ert &amp; kt@@ ts ; a message appears : both to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system there is the problem that conflicts in AL@@ SA occur , which will prevent a simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . indications for possible solutions can be found on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) under www.al@@ sa @-@ project@@ .org . &quot;
I have installed an extra voice for the festival from the internet . I have installed it and can use them in the festival but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not show this voice .
&quot; add in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / festiv@@ al@@ int / s the new voice . as guidance , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; if you have found the voice to the developers . &quot;
&quot; on the map of audio there is a setting speed . this will work , the program has to be installed and via the ambi@@ ent variable PAT@@ H . some syn@@ thesizer sounds like music Interactive we offer even on the map card for speaking card . depending on the chosen voice this is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the talk speed are ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; ( this is that the HTML is converted into SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; after &amp; XML ; ( see ) or if you are completely bra@@ ve , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ After @-@ SS@@ ML @-@ conver@@ ters , and put the microphone . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t have to be read that web sites are read with a female voice . I have a female Festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice . &quot;
&quot; at the Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day SA@@ B@@ LE GEN@@ DER does not seem to function . thus Festival no error produced , conf@@ using the X@@ SL file for converting SS@@ ML to S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER @-@ Tags . the same also applies to VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
&quot; I have added a separate character string , and now I can go in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no longer per@@ mitt@@ ing or go back . on the cart@@ on orders will display , the order disp@@ ense only out of one sentence . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; punc@@ tu@@ ation marks ( point , fro@@ g sign , com@@ ma and Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ) may not be filter@@ ed . use for this sign instead a filter for the proposition . &quot;

&quot; before you use , check first , if your language syn@@ thesizer work correctly . follow the instructions you have received with syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS @-@ syn@@ thesizer , whose source code is obvious . the quality of the votes is generally good , and there are several voices and languages . for many voices you can volume volume , microphone speed and sound height . &quot;
&quot; you need to install at least one language . help you find in the instructions that will be supplied with festival , you need to send web sites you have to install the ( male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices , you need to compile an additional module , therefore you need the source code of Festival . the German votes are subject to restrictions on transfer . &quot;
&quot; this voice is composed of 1.@@ 95 beta or newer . the voice is still in an early development stage . un@@ pack the software in the festival / lib / sec / Russian / . if you enter the Russian voices , you need to enter the votes ms@@ u _ ru _ ns@@ h _ di@@ phone . select a C@@ yr@@ il@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit@@ - ) enco@@ ding as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; you can look for the festival as first to the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the option of coding has to be adjusted to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the option of enco@@ ding must be adjusted to a 8 @-@ bit ma@@ yr@@ il@@ lic as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
Festival can be used together with the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; then the festival takes the magic analysis and &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; creates the audio output . the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ program and the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; not a constant voice fil@@ esyst@@ em . &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; generated language from Di@@ ph@@ on files . you need additional software to generate these di@@ phone .

&quot; this hand@@ book explains the installation and use of &amp; s@@ network@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; com@@ pression center ; that allows the network of network interfaces , the rout@@ ings and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ illing center ; allows the user management of a series of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ illing center ; can be called by a selection of K Menu k@@ control@@ center . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; s@@ network@@ conf ; package was developed to enable the users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way , like other settings from the &amp; cor@@ control@@ center ; create a simple surface for the following tasks : &quot;
after installation a new module system settings in the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; displayed . the module network settings ( k@@ eter@@ conf ; ) can be started by selection of cor@@ control@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in the &amp; k@@ menu .
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; clear@@ conf ; network hardware is not able to install . physical devices and their drivers have to have already been installed and configured , hence &amp; calibr@@ ated ; the tool at all indicates and setting up the network features . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices will be added to install &amp; Linux ; it will be added later , the drivers will be added by adjust@@ ing the following files in accordance with the core version , corresponding to the core version . &quot;
&quot; the network settings is loaded , if the option is selected in the &amp; cor@@ control@@ center ; index is selected . at the start@@ up of the module , it is trying to detect the platform used by the system . &quot;
&quot; if the platform may not be recognized , the complete selection is offered . it is best matches the list from the list , the distribution and the Rel@@ eas@@ stand best matches . by selecting the setting , non @-@ re @-@ surveys can define the definition permanently . at the next start of the network settings , this selection will automatically be pre @-@ adjusted . &quot;
&quot; change the network settings is only possible in the system administration mode . previously , all options are shown . previously , all options can only be considered , the change is not possible . in the system administration mode , you can click on the lower right end of the module . it is the input of the password . &quot;
&quot; in the system administration mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three rider : &quot;
&quot; the rider network interface serves to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the rider network , the following tasks can be done : &quot;
the settings required network can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and folders button to set up ... in the dialog box .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button to set the dialog with further possibilities . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of automatic , TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched by a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . the DH@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP @-@ Server sends all necessary TCP / IP information with each system start . in the selection list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected in accordance with the system . &quot;
with selecting manuals without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field IP address the IP address must be specified . in the input field network component is the sub@@ network .
&quot; this setting is marked , initi@@ alizes the system interface with boats . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values shown in this dialog are displayed as characteristics of the device .
it should be assured that IP address is not used in the network . the input of an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; kon@@ sole ; you can notice whether the desired address is already in use . in the doubt the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or off depending on the need . switch off a sign@@ posted network is done by selecting from the list and by clicking on interface .
&quot; network devices can be activated or off , depending on your needs . switching of an activation network is done by selecting from the list and folders from interface . &quot;
places the IP address of the computer in local sub@@ net which conv@@ eys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with b@@ ills into other sub @-@ networks .
&quot; if the computer is available more than a network interface , the interface has to be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is selected . &quot;
a computer with DNS support is replaced by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only be IP addresses . if the machine is necessary : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org is necessary to solve DNS this name into an IP @-@ address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 45.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the host solution is part of the nam@@ ing solution makes a simple administration of this list . entries can be added if you are removed or changed her@@ .@@ DNS entries can be arranged through a selection of one order or clu@@ e @-@ up in the list with the buttons or herd .
&quot; by clicking the button to add ... out of the group computer to name resolution , a DNS server can be added to a DNS server . it will be the dialog of the New Nam@@ eser@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; first , you have to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then add the button adding . the entry will be included in the list . &quot;
&quot; from the group machine to name resolution , select an entry and then click on the button Edit ... It will display the dialog . &quot;
the list of well known computers describes the computer @-@ IP address for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily with fast@@ ened unless no DNS server is available . in small , closed networks it can replace DNS server . &quot;
&quot; usually the list of well @-@ known computers contains some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . these are still in the test useful version of IP is supposed to replace it in the future version 4 . &quot;
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add .... The dialog will add New alias .
&quot; enter the name of the known invo@@ ices and add the button adding . if the known machine has multiple alias names , de kno@@ b adding several times and enter the other alias names . &quot;
select a name of a well @-@ known invo@@ ices from the list and select Edit .... The dialog &apos;s dialog will be displayed .
&quot; it may be done with one of the following tasks , then clicking the list of static Host@@ s will be updated . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the system settings are not immediately effective in the system . to enable changes to enable , in a &amp; con@@ sole ; the following command must be set . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ opp@@ conf ; is http : / / k@@ scrip@@ con@@ f.@@ source@@ forge@@ .net you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of bin@@ ary distribution ( mostly rpm packages ) ranges from when &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
installation of ready installed version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with graphic user such as the package or the installation tool for its distribution . &quot;
&quot; for this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but additionally the development work has been required with libraries and other things . &quot;
&quot; this is only recommended by experienced users , but it is not difficult to compile &amp; calibr@@ ated . the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter will be important information on basic network technology , in the second , all of &amp; c@@ journ@@ als ; change configuration files . &quot;
this area can not replace an additional knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x will only conv@@ ey basic information on the integration of PCs into a small ( home ) network .
&quot; currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found a wide distribution . from IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected that it is focused in the near future . this description focuses on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; one of the most important information is aware of the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , at the &amp; eg ; work@@ station is the contact address , which can be used a valid IP address or if available , DH@@ CP can not be chosen arbit@@ r@@ ary . in any case the IP address can not be chosen as desired ! &quot;
&quot; when setting up a small ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen from a specially reserved area for this purpose to avoid IP address concepts associated with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwar@@ ded to the Internet , therefore any use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the internet for such machines can be made by setting a gat@@ ew@@ ays . &quot;
for smaller networks are usually used addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
&quot; in addition , the networks are usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , allowing all the host participants in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second @-@ line route ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own machine ) . the standard route is required for IP re@@ direc@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; the mains address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . usually , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to an own so called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle . &quot;
&quot; in this part you find the configuration files , which are affected by &amp; S@@ network@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the different distribution . &quot;
&quot; this file is sometimes dynam@@ ically modified by D@@ SL connections , so that it will not be surprised if in case of active D@@ SL connections will be linked to other content as specified . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE ; is known that this file is sorted by scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand as expected can occur . &quot;

&amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; is an application that you can run other programs after a schedule in the background . it is a graphic interface for the &amp; UNIX operating system cr@@ on .
&quot; when the start of &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; take a list already registered tasks and related ambi@@ ent variable . if you use &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; as root , this will be used for all users of the system as well as for system internal tasks . &quot;
&quot; when a de@@ activated task , program name and parameters are not displayed and below description will be de@@ activated . &quot;
the general environmental variables process the otherwise existing ambi@@ ent variable for all of the functions listed above . in a de@@ activation variable appears as a description de@@ activated .
&quot; to create a new task , select first the tasks in the folder . go back in the menu to Edit New .... aging , you can also click with the right mouse button on the task folder and click on the context menu . select or C@@ tr@@ l ; N press . &quot;
enter the name of the start@@ ling program . you can specify either a relative or an absolute path@@ name . if you want to seek the program first and press release ....
&quot; select the minute ( s ) , to which the task should be executed . with &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; you can specify the minutes in five steps . &quot;
&quot; if you indicate both mon@@ day ( e ) as well as week@@ day ( e ) , the task will run both at a suitable date and on a suitable week@@ day . if you run on the 1st and 15th and Sunday regardless of the week@@ day , regardless of every Sunday of the months , no matter where date they fall . &quot;
&quot; as with the creation of new tasks , changes will only be active if the cr@@ ont@@ ab has been stored . &quot;
&quot; to cut a task , then select first to a further task . then go to Edit . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click on the task and select pressing , or press C@@ tr@@ l ; X . &quot;
&quot; to copy a task , select first to copy the task . then go to Edit . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click on the task and select C@@ tr@@ l ; C . &quot;
&quot; to insert a task , first cut into the clip@@ board or to be copied . only then , then , it is available at all . select the task folder . then go to Edit . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click on the folder and select C@@ tr@@ l ; V . &quot;
&quot; to make changes to a task , select first an option . then go to the menu item Edi@@ ting Change .... &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click on the task and edit ... select C@@ tr@@ l ; O. It will then edit C@@ tr@@ l ; O. It will then edit the dialog to edit them , as described above to the chosen task . &quot;
&quot; to delete a task , choose the task to delete it . then go to the menu item Edit Del@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; to enable an task to enable or dis@@ able , select it , and determine the condition with the menu item Edit . in@@ active tasks are marked with in@@ active description . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can also click on the task and select the activation right click on the activation that program name , parameters and description can be displayed correctly . &quot;
&quot; to run an task immediately , select this and then go to Edit Now . &quot;
&quot; to create a new environmental variable , select first the variable folder . then go to the menu item Edit New .... &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the variable folder and select new ... select C@@ tr@@ l ; N . &quot;
enter the name of variables . you can also select one of the list of the most frequently used environmental variables ; click on the arrow in addition to the field for the variable name . these are :
to send e @-@ mails from the program to another than the normal address
how the creation of new variables will make changes made only when the cr@@ ont@@ ab was saved .
&quot; to cut a variable , they first choose the variable variable . then go to editing . &quot;
&quot; to copy a ambi@@ ent variable , select first to copy the variable variable . then go to Edit . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click on the variable and select Copy , or press C@@ tr@@ l ; C . &quot;
&quot; to add a ambi@@ ent variable , first must be edited or copied into the clip@@ board . only then the option is available at all . select the variable folder . then go to Edit . &quot;
&quot; to change a variable , you first select the variable variable . go to Edit ... Altern@@ ativ you can edit and edit C@@ tr@@ l ; O .@@ It will then edit C@@ tr@@ l ; O .@@ It will then edit the dialog variable in which you are described above to edit the variable . &quot;
&quot; to delete a ambi@@ ent variable , you first choose the variable . then go to Edit Del@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; to enable a ambi@@ ent variable or to de@@ activation , select it , and place the condition with the menu item Edi@@ ting activation , appears under description De@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can also click on the variable and select the variable . make sure that the name and value of variables are correctly displayed correctly . &quot;
&quot; if all tasks and ambi@@ ent variables have been entered or modified , you still need to save the cr@@ ont@@ ab . select the menu item file stor@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can press C@@ tr@@ l ; S press . changes or supplements to tasks or variables will only become active . &quot;
&quot; it appears in the standard double ; -@@ pressure dialog . if you choose out , see that there are two extra &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; specific options in dialog dialog . &quot;
prints the cr@@ ont@@ ab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who have expanded authorisation .
cr@@ on , for example vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; used the command cr@@ ont@@ ab to change the schedul@@ es of the user . &quot;
&quot; a PO@@ SIX @-@ compliant &amp; UNIX ; , for example with g@@ lib@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands of &amp; UNIX ; to experience time and date . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; is a secure program for belt drives on the basis of t@@ ar . it offers the possibility to create several archives on a band . the second goal was to create a surface for t@@ ar , which was presented to give a surface for t@@ ar who asked my wife : how much longer takes it , when it sec@@ ures ? &quot;
&quot; before a tape can be used , it must be mounted by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be done on three ways : &quot;
&amp; k@@ dat ; cul@@ t the band back and read the precau@@ tion of the Ban@@ des . realize &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre @-@ sp@@ ann on the band will not be asked if the band should be form@@ att@@ ed .
&quot; det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre@@ y , looking for the matching index on your plate . cannot be found , you will be asked if the Band@@ index is new to be created . &quot;
&quot; if everything has gone , the symbol for belt cros@@ ses , to indicate that the band is mounted . in the stat@@ bar appears a corresponding message . in the stat@@ us@@ bar appears a corresponding message . the content of the ban@@ ana can now be performed by a cl@@ amping of the entry for the band . &quot;
&quot; before the throw of the gang , first , the integration must be solved . there are three methods to achieve this . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; gives you a change of symbols for the band , that the integration of the band was solved and displays the status bar a corresponding message . the band can now be raised without danger . &quot;
&quot; before a band of &amp; k@@ dat , it may be used by &amp; k@@ dat ; form@@ att@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; a band@@ cards must be form@@ att@@ ed before you may not be used to save data . this process does not mean that a band may be form@@ att@@ ed before the use of &amp; k@@ dat ; this process can usually be form@@ att@@ ed a form@@ atting of the gang , D@@ AT @-@ drives , on the other hand . &quot;
after entering the band@@ name and the capacity goes &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ atting of the gang . all data on the band go lost ! after completion of the form the tape will automatically be integrated and is ready to use .
&quot; before you encounter the backup process , you need to select the backup files . this can be done on three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only be backed up this file or folder .
select a f@@ ear@@ ing profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are stored .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the so marked files and / or sub@@ folders are secured .
click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and choose from the menu .
&quot; once the backup has been initiated , the dialog will open settings for backup . in this dialog you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog will display backup . the dialog displays the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives on the entry for the drive . it will only be checked the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives on the entry for the band with a hem@@ et . there are only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders .
right click on one of the archives and select the menu entry .
&quot; once the test process was started , the dialog will appear for verification . in this dialog you can check your choice and change the working folder for the review . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for verification , the dialog will review . this dialog displays the progress of the examination process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can initi@@ ate the restore , the files must be restored , marked . this can be done on two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that include entry for the band@@ width . it is restored only the selected file or sub@@ folders .
select the desired files from one of the archives with a tick . it will only be restored the selected files and / or sub@@ folders .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select a folder in the menu .
&quot; once the recovery process started , the dialog will appear for restoration . in this dialog you can once again check your choice and change the working folder for rest@@ oring . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for restoration , the dialog will appear to restore the recovery process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time . &quot;
sometimes it proves to be necessary to create the band index@@ file using the band contents . this process delet@@ es all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of tape :
below is a f@@ ading profile with the straight selected files and the standard settings . you can make the following settings :
&quot; the current working folder , where the backup is to take place . the list of saf@@ est files will be automatically updated in accordance with the currently selected working folder . &quot;
&quot; for all the folder that are listed under backup files that are stored on the same file system , as the folder . folder that can be stored on other file systems , you can see separately under backup files . each entry is considered by t@@ ar independent of the others . &quot;
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have been changed since the last incre@@ mental backup . it will only be backed up the files that have since changed since then .
the name of the file that is used to determine changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delet@@ es the snapshot file from the call by t@@ ar . this causes all files to be backed up and created a new snapshot file for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; and lt ; files was not yet fully implemented at the time of creating these documentation .
the settings can set up with the menu item KD@@ at ... in the Settings menu . the following settings can make you :
the full path to the device cl@@ amping ( usually / dev / / ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ plac@@ ements version of the belt .
&quot; this setting is active , transm@@ its &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape will load the command to load load to the drive . in some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing process can be performed . &quot;
&quot; if the option is swit@@ ched , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; the balance to lock the band@@ width . possibly this attitude does not work with all band@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; if the option is enabled , when sol@@ dering the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically use the band . use this option not to flo@@ ppy stre@@ aming . &quot;
&quot; if the option is swit@@ ched , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; the hard@@ war@@ dly block size for the belt work . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you must receive &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your band@@ width . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band form@@ att@@ ed , it writes a file at the beginning of the ban@@ ana . this file should only occup@@ y a storage block on the band . the content of the file is composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; ( n bytes ) The band @-@ ID . the format of this string is invo@@ icing : seconds , whereby invo@@ icing the complete name of the system has been form@@ att@@ ed on which the band has been form@@ att@@ ed since the ep@@ och was form@@ att@@ ed in which the band has been form@@ att@@ ed . &quot;
the band ID will be used to locate a file with the same name in the folder $ HOME / .k@@ dat / .
&quot; the remaining files on the tape are pure t@@ ar -@@ archives , which can be installed directly with &amp; GNU ; - t@@ ar manage themselves . even other t@@ ar -@@ versions should work , as long as it is not about ink@@ mental f@@ uses . &quot;
check the content of a backup tool . this symbol is only active when a band is integrated .
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ system ; the viewer for system prot@@ ocol@@ s . the program is not able to know where you can obtain information about your system , or where the system provides the different protocol files . furthermore , the system allows quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users to understand what your computer is in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simpli@@ fied presentation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is not able to know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system will depos@@ ited the different protocol files .
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users with quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore tries to provide some advanced functions , with the help of the protocol files of certain programs can be filter@@ ed and evaluated . &quot;
in the latest version 0.@@ 4.1 poss@@ esses &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of protocol files for the format of the sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included in addition and are explained in the other chapters of this hand@@ book .
&quot; as you see in the following screen@@ shot , presents &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions are available , using the individual protocol lines of a protocol @-@ file easily filter@@ ing and filter@@ ing . the individual possibilities for sorting and filters are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after starting the start , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; initially started the main protocol @-@ file of the system - the system prot@@ ector , so you have not started with system ver@@ tex , so you have not started with system ver@@ tex @-@ right . the protocol files are normally found in the folder / var / log , for normal users usually no entit@@ lement to read . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected crit@@ erion or after a given string . in the default table , the list of the log message will automatically match the filter . then a log line contains only displayed , if in one of the column contains the string string of the filter search . &quot;
&quot; you can also select another entry at this point . select the string containing the entries in accordance with selected column . select the name of a process , and enter it in the filter bar the name of a process , so shows you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines have been sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is activated in default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a stri@@ pping color as a protocol lines of level Note . the colored presentation of protocol can be swit@@ ched up .
&quot; you want to display only certain process ( e.g. in the system prot@@ ok@@ oll or C@@ ron @-@ protocol ) , so you can use the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can be useful for example , if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case use filter@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can jump the option for new lines jump in context menu of the main window to display all new added protocol lines . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ folders . to open this function , use the entries in the menu window to open additional under@@ window and manage . once you have selected a down@@ window , choose a protocol on display . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website http : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ org@@ . D@@ ort you can find further information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; can also be found in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ archive
welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; system V in@@ it Editor , more known ( and in the following also as named ) as &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; . this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sys@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the System V in@@ it develops rapidly to the standard for inspection of the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . therefore , because it is easier to use , high @-@ performance and at the same time more flexible than traditional BSD style . &quot;
I will not go further in historical aspects ( e.g. because I know nothing white : - ) .
&quot; the in@@ it @-@ bin@@ ary @-@ file is located under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is why someone could try to adjust a machine on System V in@@ it , without a re @-@ installation and new form@@ atting . therefore , you must see that the old in@@ it was removed from there , if there was there one . &quot;
the Sy@@ s@@ V in@@ it is also different from the BSD in@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are taking place directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ d. D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following further folders :
&quot; in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for each system service , which you would like to start the system or change to another run@@ level . system services include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; send@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services does not include such things like set@@ serial , which is only once started . such views belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; r@@ c.@@ local should be found on it under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems possess this file , even though it does not want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run it with the serial connection . &quot;
the kernel looks for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first that he finds .
the standard Run@@ level is registered in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point you can throw a look into the second column and probably notice that the default run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab hand and change the 3 . be careful when you start doing something by clicking the system you start the system and execute the following :
&quot; but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you enter -@@ l in rc@@ 3.@@ d , then you will probably see something like the following : &quot;
&quot; you will notice that in this folder , no correct files are . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d . &quot;
how does it start and stops in@@ it actually system services ? easy : each of the scripts is so written that there is an argument as start to start and stop . you can actually launch these scripts on the command line :
&quot; this would hold the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one K includes , the script will be called with the argument stop . if he includes a S , the script will be started with the argument . &quot;
&quot; some people wish to set up a simple way , machines for many purposes . I could have a server running , which can only run htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; run . in addition , I could also have a user -@@ Run@@ level ; network &amp; etc . , network &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; it should not be very difficult , because the program was as user @-@ friendly as possible . &quot;
&quot; the use of &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; with a mouse or another po@@ inter is simple to say not to say , just drag an entry from the area of the Available system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) . &quot;
&quot; you can move scripts also between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n , or change the position within a level by changing it from its original run@@ level ( or its position ) . this only does not happen when they draw an entry from the area of the Available system services . &quot;
&quot; note : entries will be post@@ pon@@ ed , if you want to copy this into a new area . in order to copy them to a new run@@ level , you must explicitly choose from the menu Edit or from the context menu -- even then , if the same entry exists before in the target range of action . &quot;
the sorting number of one entry can sometimes not be calculated sometimes . in such a case you have to edit the type of the surrounding entries before you can try to insert the system service .
&quot; note : currently there is no way to restore entries , which were thrown in the tr@@ ash . be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the tab@@ ulator button to enable the different work areas ( availability system services , run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection , or below the previous date . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry into another run@@ level , move it with cut into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired run@@ level with inser@@ tion ( C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sorting number or the name of a entry manually , press the input button to switch between different fields . use the dialog by selecting the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to change the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data transfer , all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before they will be executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pre@@ ference will be taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) . otherwise they are stored by &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; otherwise they are stored by &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; to be restored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I have experim@@ ented with the default run@@ le@@ vel@@ n , and now the machine is resistant new . what can I do ? &quot;
&quot; enter the LI@@ LO -@@ Promp@@ t linux single and press the entry button to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) . &quot;
&quot; I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; for execution under Run@@ level X , but they will not be executed . &quot;
&quot; if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distribu@@ tions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution . &quot;
&quot; the way to be started as system services in these distribu@@ tions , simpli@@ fies the configuration for the propri@@ etary setup programs of this distribution , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
