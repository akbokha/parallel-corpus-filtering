Velvias is also a few photographers, especially those who have little landscapes."</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neonfilter simulated Neonlight at the contrasting seams. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sliding repetitions the strength of the neo-light. in large pictures the filter can load the whole CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon that you want to correct the colour reflex and the luminosity of the photos. you can experimenting the various colour aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. once you are satisfied with the results you are using the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo of bad light conditions you can get the reverse issue: one to big saturation. also in this case the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice for saturation. all changes you can do in the preview. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool gradation, and the simple luminosity / contrast / gamma is the tool sound value to improve the exposure. even if the dialogue concerning this tool is very complicated, only the field of slider. concretely the three sliders below the histogramms."</seg>

<seg id="480">"sharpen is a traditional tool for pening. it is very fast and easy, but created, especially in dark fields, granularity."</seg>
<seg id="481">Unsharfe-Maske works on the contrast to look a picture sharpening to look a picture. actually it does not use it to remove atmospheric Dunst and it makes it a really good job. the algorithm was taken out of Gimp and he is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocussing is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the harness. it is a bit more complicated in its use and has various parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitised images need a correction of the bulk materials. this in turn leads to a common color together. the same phenomenon can be observed if color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras will normally require more incompatible with the normal cameras for the private user.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG image often have been applied to a camera internal sharpening. images in the raw material on the other hand must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanner turn a sharpening filter already during the reading of the picture. if you disable this, you get the control over your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can find useful results by pressing a photo with the shovens value. that you can correct with the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">"but you should deal with caution, as the results does not seem very natural: the sharpening of the edges, but also reinforced the smokers of an image to correct the tool. you can find more information on the menu entry. under Refocussing, you can find more information and a comparison of all techniques to sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too tight. the solution to record the picture is a little soft and experimenting with the menu entry. use the device on the right side of the dialog it shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter blurred is a very good tool to remove veils of your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview help the image to edit. the showcase indicates the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the standard values often produce good results and should first step forward. an increase in the radius or the amount will reinforce the effect. if you generate the Unknown Maske, become robbed and the impression of grats in the vicinity of sharp edge."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels that are affected by the filter by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. they should therefore take pictures best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the wishlist picture that is added to the original. thus the strength of the harness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">"the swelling value is a fraction from the maximum RGB value and the use of difference. it can thus be applied to minimal differentiation for a edge of the filter. in this way, areas with a soft change between the tones of sharpenalties and therefore beauty-surfaces are avoided."</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image the (2). blur masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swelling = 0.0. "</seg>
<seg id="496">The & D came; Tool Refocal refunds a picture by improving the harness. it used to be protected by copyrighted unfolding filter -algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">"this tool is trying to make a picture of & quot; refocusation quot; in which it makes a better approach than trying to sharfy the photo. it is used for using a technique called FIR Wiener filtering. Refocal points usually reaches better results as unsharp masking. you can start it from the menu by selecting colors Refocussing in image processing."</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice the circular is much better than the Gauß 'sche Faltung. the Gauß' sche Faltung has a very long tail, which leads to the mathematical outcome, which is far from the original quellpixel. the FIR Wiener Inverse of the Gauß's folding is influenced in most cases even very strongly influenced by the remote pixel. it causes unwanted results."</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular harness: this is the main parameters for the use of this module. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most pictures should result the default value 1 good results. you can add a higher value when your image should be very blurred but then on it is used.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artifacts. usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1; & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpest effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in diamond filter can help you to reduce the values of 0-1. however values are higher than 0.1 only rarely helpful. if the smoker filter is too low and eg; 0 the image quality is very badly. a usable value is 0.03. a high value will continue to taste the image.</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauß'sche Schärfe: this is the radius for the Gauß 'sche shards. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. in most cases you should use this value to prevent annoying artifacts, so you might also have to increase the correlation and / or noise."</seg>
<seg id="503">Matriet size: this value determines the size of the transformation size. this value determines a good results especially if you choose big values for the circular harley or the Gauß 's shards. in most cases you should choose great values for these parameters. in most cases you should choose a value in the area of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The storing as well as loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose. each Refocal parameter gives you set to be saved for later and then can be loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try all the tailing, color and intensity corrections on the image before you use the module. "</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the picture before you can change the picture. the reason for this is that much operations changes are not visible immediately but later unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">"if you are reading images and compress, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally produced blurred Maskels better results as scarf. this could be caused by blurred masking a larger neighborhood used as scarfs.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically you need to blurred masking always have to create artifacts. even under optimal conditions it can never show the effect of the Unknown filter. practical is the result of the FIR Wiener Filters are always at least as good as the Unripe Maske. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better in the processing of small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">"below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused picture, see:"</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color picture has to be corrected. this picture was made with an analog camera. the unfocused outcome is due to insufficient light for the auto-focus linse.</seg>

<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects greater structures. the higher this value is, the more it is necessary, as it is difficult to generate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh's turmot effect, it must be higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: returns on how often the algorithm is going through. normally there is 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">"Winkelgraduated da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropen Alpha. if Alpha is small, it should also be small to create a long run time. they should therefore take this value as greatest possible and acceptable to your needs."</seg>

<seg id="655">The Goldene Spirale will bring you better results for your photos. in comparison to third-rails produces the golden spiral generates a liquid line of the eye through the picture. this type of composition shows the view of the spiral and create a balanced visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">"another rule are the right corner of golden spiral, also called golden Spirals. this right corner is used to create the golden spiral. this can be a line or different objects. this thing can simply be there without the eye, it will fulfil its task."</seg>
<seg id="657">"the Golden triangles also lead themselves from the above discussed spiral. their vertices are the centerpiece of sides of golden triangles. take note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles can be found in contrast to harmonious interest, a static object can be dynamic."</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles at your frame or create a effect of the professional photographer's dynamic symmetry. try your picture on one of the intersections and other visual information in the angles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve different.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options horizon mirror and vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmonic particles.</seg>

<seg id="1044">If you switch anti-aliing to switch and connects & Povray; more than one beam per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">"& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is a adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling is adapted; recursively because every pixels is still further divided and adapted for the records of the calculated color values."</seg>
<seg id="1046">"if you choose the first method, if you choose the first method, POV-Ray stepped up to the nearby pixels with super-sampling, then both pixels by the tracking of a given additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the downturn on 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be charged at a downhill of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixels."</seg>
<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixel is calculated: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:"</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the color values, the pixels was divided into 4 subpixel, which can be pursued individually and on further subdivision. the maximum depth of records can be set up with the depths."</seg>

<seg id="1663">"the optional AllKeysTo M is needed to put all tones using the number M (e.g. with sound 60), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which can be similar to the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so now a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 (gun allowance), it takes patch 100 (the Drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>

<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to pass such as tones on a certain channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as their availability. so you have to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you just need to use various names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to scored tints on the percussions. take a look at the supplied keymaps.</seg>

<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch Option can be useful for example to always use the percussions patch on the percussions.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderRatio will be multiplied, in which relationship Pitch-Bender events are multiplied, with the value n * (r / 4096), this with the formula N * (r / 4096) is calculated and then passed only. the value 4096 is being used in the map file not decimal kommas)."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM proposes that a keyboard is supposed to play a keyboard around 4096, a tone higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards about two tones up to a octave higher to play. to try the right value on your keyboard, you must check a bit with & kmid."</seg>

<seg id="2957">"the System V init develops rapidly to the standard for inspection of the system in the & Linux; world. therefore, because it is easier to use, high-performance and at the same time more flexible than traditional BSD style."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further in historical aspects (e.g. because I know nothing white: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the init-binary-file is located under / sbin and not under / etc. this is why someone could try to adjust a machine on System V init, without a re-installation and new formatting. therefore, you must see that the old init was removed from there, if there was there one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV init is also different from the BSD init that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are taking place directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following further folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">"init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for each system service, which you would like to start the system or change to another runlevel. system services include such things such as network, NFS, & sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services does not include such things like setserial, which is only once started. such views belong to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"rc.local should be found on it under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems possess this file, even though it does not want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run it with the serial connection."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks for different places after the program init and starts the first that he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard Runlevel is registered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can throw a look into the second column and probably notice that the default runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it / etc / inittab hand and change the 3. be careful when you start doing something by clicking the system you start the system and execute the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the right scripts? if you enter -l in rc3.d, then you will probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">"you will notice that in this folder, no correct files are. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d."</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does it start and stops init actually system services? easy: each of the scripts is so written that there is an argument as start to start and stop. you can actually launch these scripts on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would hold the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one K includes, the script will be called with the argument stop. if he includes a S, the script will be started with the argument."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people wish to set up a simple way, machines for many purposes. I could have a server running, which can only run httpd, & sendmail;, network & etc; run. in addition, I could also have a user -Runlevel; network & etc., network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">"here you learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult, because the program was as user-friendly as possible."</seg>
<seg id="2972">"the use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is simple to say not to say, just drag an entry from the area of the Available system services to one of the six runlevel to start it on this level (or stop)."</seg>
<seg id="2973">"you can move scripts also between Runleveln, or change the position within a level by changing it from its original runlevel (or its position). this only does not happen when they draw an entry from the area of the Available system services."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries will be postponed, if you want to copy this into a new area. in order to copy them to a new runlevel, you must explicitly choose from the menu Edit or from the context menu -- even then, if the same entry exists before in the target range of action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of one entry can sometimes not be calculated sometimes. in such a case you have to edit the type of the surrounding entries before you can try to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: currently there is no way to restore entries, which were thrown in the trash. be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tabulator button to enable the different work areas (availability system services, runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection, or below the previous date."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry into another runlevel, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired runlevel with insertion (Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorting number or the name of a entry manually, press the input button to switch between different fields. use the dialog by selecting the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to change the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of data transfer, all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before they will be executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. preference will be taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc). otherwise they are stored by & ksysv; otherwise they are stored by & ksysv; to be restored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">"I have experimented with the default runleveln, and now the machine is resistant new. what can I do?"</seg>
<seg id="2983">"enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the entry button to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine)."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for execution under Runlevel X, but they will not be executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way to be started as system services in these distributions, simplifies the configuration for the proprietary setup programs of this distribution, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you are using a different distribution: please check if all configuration files are available (and also, whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd), simply complete without notice, if their configuration files are not available or wrong."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the meaning of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version, please send me information about the runlevel so that this handbook can be added to this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">"to begin with & kuser; it is sufficient, the chapter adaptation of & kuser; to read."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after you have made changes, you must save this. either use the corresponding symbol of the toolbar or the entry Save in the File menu."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two boxes, the user and the user list. to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry. it appears the dialog's user and group properties."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"some map-cards are only shown if you have made extended system settings. only if you have rankings, a card card will be created, if you can make individual settings, if Shadow -passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd like in BSD-Unixen are installed."</seg>
<seg id="2994">The map-card password is released in case Shadow -passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd like in BSD -Unixen are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card card appears only if for at least a built-in filesystem (Quota) is activated and initialized (identifiable on the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here you can be modified for each user parameters in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be adjusted individually for each filesystem. the current file system will be selected using the field of file system.</seg>
<seg id="2997">"the card-card groups provides information about the group members of the selected user. the standard group, to which the user belongs, you will find in the field of primary group. furthermore, the user can be a member in other groups by setting them in the large field."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"the dialog's dialog includes a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list."</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or a group, you can add adding from the menu user or group or click the appropriate Add button. the Edit or deleting the selected user and the selected group works analog. "</seg>
<seg id="3000">"with this module you can install the LILO boot manager, remove the boot password, remove and change the time to the boats of the standard system, remove the default system, edit, modify operating systems, remove and more."</seg>
