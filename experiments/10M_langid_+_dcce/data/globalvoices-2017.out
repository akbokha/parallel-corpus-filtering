although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year ago I would live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is exceptionally great .
&quot; as many of my generation I grew up with American films , American authors have read and operated its sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had a profound effect on me that I was mainly for a American film journ@@ alist . &quot;
&quot; as 14 @-@ year @-@ years I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , which was made with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts as Jura @-@ Stu@@ dens of a oil stomach , which were the top Bundes@@ court with judges , who had his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free according to Meth@@ od Man , &apos; me &apos; s , as if the absolute truth is , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year that I lived in Arizona , my ad@@ mir@@ ation for the US had only even stronger . &quot;
&quot; I always said , &quot; America is the only country where I ever lived , whose diversity is so inv@@ iting that you can always be that you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I was even written a very sw@@ elling love about his size .
then Donald Tru@@ mp came .
much has been written about the en@@ vis@@ ho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his as@@ cen@@ sion is for me as he goes with his bott@@ oms .
he never stops behind the mountain as one says so beautiful .
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks , like a former colleague , and explained publicly his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , A@@ fro@@ am@@ eri@@ cans and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people have responded to his statements and tun@@ ed it for him . &quot;
&quot; 13 million voices , which he won at the Repub@@ li@@ can pre @-@ elections , was the highest number that presented one from the party nomin@@ ee candidate . &quot;
I was speech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans who support these big@@ so@@ ons , asked me ? &quot;
I was able to bring Tru@@ mp and his voters do not associate with the people who I met while my time in Phoenix .
&quot; as for example my Professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of the journ@@ alist program , the people from all over the world takes on a deep breath , with whom I could talk about Islam and its past . &quot;
&quot; the Tru@@ mp@@ s cosmo@@ s not coinci@@ ded with the by Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati in@@ quir@@ er , &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met us with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix Suns in the game .
&quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s intoler@@ ance stands also in contrast to gener@@ osity that I lived at Sandy B@@ ahr , who is fighting for her life for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son . &quot;
&quot; nor fits them to the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped with a lot of patience and grace to me and my colleagues helped to get used to the complexity of the American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew L@@ eck@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors who helped me a lot to me . &quot;
these people and the values are deep@@ ened my love for America .
&quot; during the Tru@@ mp of his way to the nominal Repub@@ li@@ can presidential elections , they offered me a grip and the counter@@ piece to its limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on 8 November 2016 , over 50 million Americans were mostly female , the pres@@ idency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his cont@@ emp@@ t compared to non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the examination of the idea that people have tun@@ ed for Tru@@ mp because they shared either his rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were ready to over@@ look these things , broke me almost the heart . &quot;
perhaps it is un@@ fair the bust@@ le @-@ voters as a cas@@ hier to call .
&quot; to arrange people , one of my friends , is exactly what has led us to that situation . &quot;
&quot; this is super@@ ficial and respect@@ ful , and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act in a different way . &quot;
it shows the people that their concerns and fears about the h@@ ec@@ tic changes in their communities are not considered .
&quot; could it be that these voters who are most white , for Tru@@ mp , because they want to reg@@ ain control over a country that she has disappointed ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might want to say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , one cannot forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , which deci@@ des the cru@@ el decision to raise a man who look with cont@@ emp@@ t for those who look differently from it . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( b@@ m . &lt; . : much like &quot; conditions of the White against all other eth@@ es &quot; ; Wor@@ t@@ ting from white in reference to the White and W@@ hi@@ pl@@ ash , which means that the big Van Jones has been called , exactly what America has been so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate American Ideal - regardless of whether my@@ th or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background one can always have , America means every welcome . &quot;
&quot; for this country elected as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; but with the choice of Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s , there is a huge part of the white America &apos;s promise , and says : to hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 the white man is again on the ru@@ der , they say . &quot;
&quot; with all that I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Kh@@ an , the father of a soldiers who has fallen in Iraq , and what he said at the eve of the choice . &quot;
at a manifest@@ ation for Hill@@ ary Clinton had Mr. Kh@@ an exchange with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , would have my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; Mr. Kh@@ an . &quot;
&quot; the quantity rep@@ lied with a &quot; &quot; strong &quot; &quot; no ! &quot;
&quot; would you have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; dis@@ rup@@ ture the amount .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos had a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; answer them . &quot;
do A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they and their voices were destroyed . &quot;
&quot; would anyone who do not have such as you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a ra@@ iny and powerful &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
&quot; Mr. Kh@@ an closed with the words : &quot; &quot; God be thanks , Mr. Tru@@ mp , is that not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was correc@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; the land , for which his son was like , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tru@@ mp@@ s land , said the message . &quot;
&quot; and all the people , which look like Mr. Kh@@ an , could no place in this new America . &quot;
and that breaks my heart .

&quot; that the music that is played on both places , not only the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large g@@ arb@@ age dump , only 16 Kilom@@ eters south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 , an old colonial city , which is very popular among the tourists , but worlds from the nearby preventive ruins and its world famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for some years now the La B@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) in the municipality : one of children and adults existing Symphony Orchestra , which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty . &quot;
a music @-@ school with 100 students has become the central interest for the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community that is located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mex@@ ik@@ os is known for their drugs abuse and the ban@@ ana violence .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pil@@ ots who started a musical project and the youth offered so a rare hop@@ eless@@ ly offered .
&quot; the young band@@ members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously , the local press not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI : &quot;
&quot; once they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch , they run through the du@@ sty streets to follow their big passion . &quot;
&quot; they always come and playing with gloss@@ y eyes and play in the chest you learn day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , Wald@@ horn , Pau@@ ke , B@@ ong@@ os and the Con@@ ga to play . &quot;
music from g@@ arb@@ age
&quot; more than 7.@@ 000 kilometers south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are playing the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a - a village , which is practically on the largest g@@ arb@@ age dump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n of the province of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n . &quot;
&quot; music with re @-@ prepared instruments , made up of local fixed waste materials , made in a workshop for Musi@@ kin@@ stru@@ mente in Cat@@ eur@@ a , where the recycling led by F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ ve@@ z to transform parts of the case into instruments . &quot;
&quot; the instruments im@@ pregn@@ ated violin , viola , cello , bass , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trumpet , trumpet , tromb@@ ones and percussion , which were all made of the g@@ arb@@ age . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ pertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ical and Latin American music as well as music of Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article of the Los Angeles Times F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ ve@@ z , a local ec@@ ologist and music instructor of the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a , to the first @-@ time period : &quot;
&quot; first , it was very difficult because we had no place for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to stop at the same place where children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live with their children . &quot;
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something that he had never seen before : one of the fall of the violin .
&quot; today , there is a whole orchestra , playing on instruments of re@@ prepared material and called The Recy@@ cl@@ ed Orchestra . &quot;
a documentation called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( harmon@@ ic tr@@ ash ) shows the musical performance at :
the world produces approximately one billion tons of tr@@ ash each year .
those who live with him and by him are the hass@@ les - like the people in Cat@@ eur@@ a . Paraguay .
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ational swing from tr@@ ash music around the world .
the Orchestra has even played his music from Pope Fran@@ cis@@ kus :

photo Â© Fish @-@ i Africa - a project that fought the wild fishing fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that targeted about international , practic@@ ing solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
the re @-@ release occurs in the context of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
&quot; in West Africa that this ship was already known that this ship had already operated in liberal waters illegal fishing , before there was the other coast of Africa . &quot;
the East African countries were above accordingly up@@ lifted and little gen@@ ded to welcome a law@@ ful of this kind to their co@@ asts .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Comor@@ os , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Seych@@ elles mobil@@ ised itself rapidly against the ship . they are refer@@ enced to him , one of their ports and consec@@ rated to him a fishing permit . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ suddenly , the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply refer@@ ring to Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a lei@@ d@@ ment of the Ken@@ yan Fisch@@ erei@@ regulatory authorities . he is part of a team who discovered the ship at time and followed . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch him there fish . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , because of pl@@ under@@ ing the fish stocks of the country . &quot;
&quot; at the core of this initiative , the criminal practices protects and resources , was Fish @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by NGOs ( Ill@@ eg@@ ale Fish@@ eries ( Ill@@ eg@@ ale Fish@@ eries ) . &quot;
the members of this network are next to Somalia and Madagascar the six countries which had displac@@ ed the prime minister out of their waters .
&quot; &quot; with this we have eight countries which are like @-@ minded people and work together . they exchange information and stand together with each other where it is about illegal fishing industry , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts &apos;s project ending Ill@@ egal Fishing . this project offers Fish and technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is controlled by definition of un@@ regulated : what is being caught , present , present , it is extremely difficult to maintain it . this is the illegal fishing in a main focus of over@@ fishing regions . &quot;
&quot; by the estimated dis@@ regard of existing laws , by means of which certain hab@@ itats and species are to be protected , can harm the illegal fishing eco@@ systems that have a del@@ ik@@ ates balance . &quot;
&quot; but while action against illegal fishing once were disabled by bureau@@ crati@@ c hur@@ d@@ les , and also by the Schn@@ eck@@ ent@@ emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries in real time , with tr@@ ace@@ able on Fish @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; there , the individual countries can share the individual countries with each other lists of existing licenses , updates to sus@@ pic@@ ious activities or details that one had noticed during a port spec@@ ulator . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive , if they move on the open Sea by means of satellite . &quot;
&quot; this allows the authorities to mark ships , which fishing in bot@@ her@@ ed areas . also let us discover that a ship suggests that a ship charges on other ships on the way . &quot;
&quot; in the Ide@@ al@@ apse may give such studies whether the participating ships have a fisher@@ y @-@ license where they were on the go , and possibly also whether they have a criminal off@@ ence . &quot;
countries that are against illegal fisher@@ y can be found on the basis of this information then the adoption of such ships in their ports . what means that the ships could not sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to the numbers of criminal off@@ ences as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is then about significant financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing fishing is no longer worth@@ while . &quot;
&quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Berg@@ h , director director of NF@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultant company dedicated to fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also Fish Con@@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already mentioned platform was created to gain 20 million USD in lost sales , which loses eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i every year due to the illegal fisher@@ man who inv@@ ading in East African waters . &quot;
&quot; East @-@ Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una @-@ fish species , present the region for commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also these illegal fishermen . &quot;
&quot; their practices include actions such as the s@@ ails under false flag , coun@@ terf@@ eit licence papers , st@@ resses of fantas@@ y , the fish @-@ protected species and the fish in nature areas . &quot;
&quot; &quot; they are targeted the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a not completely organised control system , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; earlier a ship was illegal and a country could then say &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t want to walk my harbour . &quot;
but another country could say &apos; C@@ ome to me &apos; . &apos; and exactly this leg@@ ale g@@ pf@@ lo@@ ch tries to close Fish i .
so far the closed front works .
&quot; since its foundation , Fish was involved in more than 30 studies of susp@@ ected ships . &quot;
it has criminal networks revealed to split the f@@ ake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that have several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and found its fle@@ eting ships have been pursued and found .
&quot; due to its collaboration with Inter@@ pol , the international Authority on combating crime , fish can share information on illegal fishing over large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our studies lead us rather far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; says Berg@@ h . &quot;
&quot; he builds a system , the fish @-@ i should help to per@@ il@@ ater@@ al ships accurate . &quot;
photo with friendly permission of Fish @-@ i Africa .
&quot; Fish &apos;s satellite system , which is always further developed , also helps to hide the illegal ships that would like to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and position , &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Ch@@ ef@@ analyses at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at Tracking , an NGO , who also deals with fisheries data and Fish @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships turn off for example their automatic identification systems , which they can no longer be cleaned by satellite . &quot;
Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that connects different information levels together . there is a fish @-@ i help to find criminal ships with larger precision .
a model program
but Fish &apos;s team can actually influence the African nations in African nations without the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing industry ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the NR@@ O Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has recently opened the Platform Global Fishing Watch : a platform that offers satellite channels and can be shown worldwide by means of the position of each tr@@ ace@@ able ship worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighb@@ ors to get a better picture of what does it does - this gives us a sense , &quot; &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to un@@ ite and to bund@@ le their resources for investigation . &quot;
&quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has allowed a similar project in which a global system allows the persecution of ships permitted . &quot;
there are signs that fish @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only cri@@ min@@ ish but they also dis@@ fri@@ ght .
&quot; ships , which used earlier without licence , and hardly expected with consequences , now they know that they are observed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the participating in Fish @-@ i participating countries have now set a 33 % increase in fish stocks , since fishing boats more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after Fish @-@ i Somalia had helped to have Gre@@ ko 1 , the insp@@ ectors found there on board tow@@ ing networks , whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo with friendly permission of Fish @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice this successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we have now to copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; in West Africa disappear annually several hundred million dollars through illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; there are six countries assembled in 2015 to the so called West Africa Task Force . now , they now fight the illegal fishing , after exactly the same model such as Fish . &quot; &quot; With security is the goal , even more such initiatives and structures can also be created in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , Fish &apos;s younger member of the Ris@@ land Somalia has been his first big tri@@ umph : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship which was on the move on the wrong flag . and not only the ship was used without a license and were used to go by now . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated current waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the Take @-@ rules against Gre@@ ko 1 put the strong sign that they go against illegal fishing fishing . &quot; &quot; says Berg@@ h . &quot;
&quot; for Fish , this is another success of many . and at the same time proof that such a special , collabor@@ ative approach to protect the oceans actually works throughout the world Ocean .

under the has@@ ht@@ ag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the back of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
&quot; the debate is also led in other parts of the country - among other things in the flat district of Bar@@ ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira , in the central regions of MÃ©@@ ri@@ ob@@ o and on the Isl@@ a Margar@@ ita in the federal state of Nu@@ eva Es@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country is deteri@@ or@@ ated continuously , which makes it noticeable in the everyday life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an ac@@ ute lack of foods and drugs . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw in the ministers of the current President Nicol@@ Ã¡@@ s Mad@@ uro , the chance of a fundamental change ; but ultimately , the dra@@ fting of a re@@ election of the official government was block@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , co @-@ acting with Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ izes in their latest articles in the context of the governance of the government : &quot;
&quot; as part of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation and awareness has been estimated to the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of foods and medicine is to give the opportunity to return his institutional structures and close a new government alliance . &quot;

&quot; in other parts of the country tried several prot@@ esters , to hold the police forces , including these women in the An@@ den@@ state T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira : &quot;

the interview was translated into English and will be published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced from his father to view the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine town of C@@ Ã³@@ rd@@ oba . &quot;
as now grown Qui@@ j@@ ano said in the context of the Great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of C@@ Ã³@@ rd@@ oba against his father .
&quot; in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investig@@ ated during the Argent@@ ine@@ an army . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not changed his life .
&quot; starting with the BÃ¼r@@ de , the same name as his father contribute to the bru@@ tal military installations in prison La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he has suffered enough . &quot;
for 34 years he included the fam@@ ily@@ for himself .
in the situation then I believed that was in order .
I felt like a o@@ bedi@@ ence .
&quot; as a child with 15 years , you do not remember that one will manip@@ ulated by his father . &quot;
&quot; at that time I could not recognize that my Father was a th@@ ief , torture and mur@@ der@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ arm@@ our@@ ebe@@ am@@ ter . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship , from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state intervention , was his father of 1976 to 1978 , Deputy Head of Secret Services in the prison of La Per@@ la . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano .

&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ press@@ ors that is charged for ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the ab@@ duction of a 10 @-@ year child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who had experienced the scale of the atro@@ cities that he had experienced as a boy , and who told in front of a federal court against his own father . &quot;

&quot; when my father began to take hold me to the military base , I often went with us into the sports hall . there I had made me with a boy who made mar@@ tial sports . &quot;
&quot; all called him &quot; &quot; K@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I told my father of him , and some days later he showed me a black white photo and called me to identify my friend on it . &quot;
he said :
&quot; you are an ar@@ mor@@ row , you have noted you with one of the ERP family . &quot;
pass only on that they do not lead you one day and I have to save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito revol@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - revolution@@ aries of the military arm of the revolution@@ aries of Argentina . &quot;
therefore he offered me to go back into the sports hall . some days later he took me to the military base .
he said me , I would become o@@ ei@@ mag@@ ent . &quot;
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . for so my Father had educated me .
&quot; on the military base , I had to destroy the Pap@@ iers who heard the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propag@@ anda , books , simply everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ da dr@@ practice the prisoners are tor@@ tured
my father took me a total of four times after La Per@@ la with - all in 1976 .
&quot; during the first and last time , he let me wait for the entrance in the car . &quot;
&quot; when he took me the second time , he took me into the second time , he led me to a bar@@ ac@@ ke , in the cars , furniture , television , refriger@@ ators - simply everything possible - were standing . &quot;
everything of that was st@@ olen .
&quot; he gave me a little into a blan@@ ket and blessed me to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that it was a big cl@@ ump of silver . &quot;
&quot; on this day I went to the other end of Bar@@ ac@@ ke , where the engra@@ ved items were made and talked with a guard . &quot;
suddenly he pointed out on an open space and said :
the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
&quot; I sp@@ ake in and saw a li@@ ege , on the man tor@@ tured . &quot;
it looked like a field bed and metal springs .
&quot; later , I found out that it was attached to the end of a Cab@@ al . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was right now there . &quot;
&quot; they rarely finds a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , over@@ shed it with water and hunting him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ it@@ als . &quot;

the bases there dr@@ in was dischar@@ ged ... like a dirty winds .
&quot; years later , when my father stood under house ar@@ rest , the same sm@@ ell came from his room . &quot;
I realized the sm@@ ell right away again and I was clear that the sm@@ ell of a body in need is .
I could never forget this sm@@ ell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a man can do another so much sor@@ row ?
I knew that these people were killed .
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were cap@@ tiv@@ ated with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were b@@ ind . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilians who was also indic@@ ted in the process ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people with the face down@@ wards - all were ti@@ led by hands and feet .
near the entrance kis@@ sing man quiet@@ ly on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; when my father noticed that I saw to the prisoners , he said , &quot; what gu@@ ck@@ st you so , Ar@@ sch@@ hole ? &quot;
&quot; I did so , Why hast thou brought me otherwise ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers and buried .
I know that because my father told at home .
&quot; in addition to La cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero there was a man folded and put together .
&quot; ( according to the dates of survi@@ vor@@ s , J@@ orge Rom@@ ero which was also indic@@ ted in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process , who was also indic@@ ating the students Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) . &quot;
&quot; in the following video Em@@ ili@@ o Fes@@ thalle , the head of the memorial La Per@@ la , by the former followers of follow . &quot;
&quot; the way to where you came here , is also the way , where the kid@@ neys came here . &quot;
&quot; if you look on the map , see that they took about this path and then tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot;
&quot; here , their names have been changed and they were regarded as part of the process of dischar@@ ged a number . &quot;
&quot; when they survi@@ ved the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement of above came that they should be laid . &quot;
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the determination of men and the dis@@ appearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; war
my father brought all sorts of st@@ olen things with home .
at that time at the age I had no idea what the &quot; war testi@@ fied &quot; - as they knew it - was .
&quot; but when I was later in the military , - I was in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - I was clear that war dict@@ ated a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military marks that one takes an enemy that one has fought . &quot;

&quot; but when you go into a house and the refrigerator , the turn@@ table , clothing , painting , pictures ... sti@@ ffer , then this is not a war @-@ mare but V@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I always asked me how my father , the head of security forces , at this V@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I just understand it .
&quot; I was also an officer at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I never liked it , into a house and to ste@@ al it all in it . &quot;
I don &apos;t understand how my Father could do that .
&quot; once , he called me a crime and I rep@@ lied , and thou that you have cars on the road ? &quot;
you are not a crime ?
he explo@@ ded before W@@ ut , struck me and cr@@ ying : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and bring you stran@@ ger . &quot;
for this we no one need others !
so my father was .
I have no single memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the trial , I showed a photo of back then on which I had a jacket and a sco@@ oter pul@@ lover from Wol@@ le . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothes with home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , def@@ ended me defense , a co @-@ con@@ spir@@ ators for this crime . I ref@@ used , no problem , they can put me to the burden what they wanted . &quot;
I was anyway there to stop out .
&apos;@@ the dis@@ appear@@ ances of the body is the last ab@@ sent act &apos;
&quot; now , where I am older , I find rep@@ ent@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; I have children . if you have only children , you can see the value of a life . &quot;
it develops further and realis@@ es that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; good , you so have ex@@ iled during the dictatorship of the dictatorship . but what to the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why children do lead ?
one day my father brought a girl killed at home whose mother was killed .
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked me the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
they could have just been able to put them into prison .
&quot; I supp@@ ose , it was just decided to kill these people . but what to leave their cor@@ p@@ ses ? &quot;
had these people not even families to whom you could commit their mort@@ al survival ?
the dis@@ appear@@ ances of the body is the last ab@@ sent act that one can do to man .
&quot; my father told me , when democracy was restored , they had machines to eliminate the mort@@ al rem@@ n@@ ment of prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were destroyed and somewhere ent@@ ails - no clu@@ e , where . &quot; &quot; you will never find something &quot; , &quot; said my Father . &quot;
but anything of course remains always .
I have seen how you have killed people ! &apos;
only to stop it : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminal law - including my Father .
&quot; the thought , display my father , arose during a conversation , when he stood under house ar@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; I made him a rul@@ er because of all of the atro@@ cities , which I had to experience . &quot;
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have nobody killed . &quot;
&quot; I felt intern@@ ally and asked me to the whole survi@@ vor@@ ed patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they alleg@@ edly def@@ ended , actually good . &quot;
then I cr@@ ying :
how can you tell me ?
I have seen how you have killed people !
you have been terri@@ fied crimes committed and you have forced me as a child to participate .
he ref@@ used only &quot; Na then for@@ g me yet . &quot;
this is what I did .
in 2010 I ref@@ used the first ad .
I have finally recognized that he was a bre@@ ach .
nobody can throw me that I was bi@@ ased . I finally have said against my own Father .

a translation error makes older people in Ky@@ oto at &quot; fri@@ ght@@ ful drivers &quot;
the sign with the translation error in a center in Ky@@ oto where you can extend his leadership .
the photo was spread in social media .
processing of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese city of Ky@@ oto , customers of a newly opened center where you can extend his leadership , last month witness a very special translation . &quot;
&quot; on a shield became the Japanese word of both , and the &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; means , &quot; &quot; possibly &quot; &quot; - maybe but also with mal@@ icious back@@ ge@@ ant &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; &quot; fri@@ ction drivers &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the false translation was opened from 1 to 20 September to electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
&quot; elabor@@ ation of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , shared in the social media . &quot;
&quot; the mistake was made of the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ oto , fallen . he was also attentive to the loc@@ alities . &quot;
in Ky@@ oto &apos;s daily Ky@@ oto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it happen to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city like Ky@@ oto just un@@ acceptable , &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the faul@@ ty English translation has been removed at first . the term &quot; &quot; drivers &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate , although gram@@ mati@@ cally not entirely correct design@@ ation &quot; Elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Ky@@ oto ap@@ olog@@ ised for translation errors . furthermore , they said that the errors was already included in the text that they were received by transl@@ ators and that the translation has not been checked before they released . &quot;
a blog@@ ger reported as follows on the exc@@ use :
&quot; it is sincer@@ ely sorry that older people felt through the in@@ sufficient correction ( the translation ) to us , &quot; &quot; said the Police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ cast News sat some more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; fri@@ ght@@ able &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; hor@@ ri@@ ble &quot; &quot; was removed as an un@@ acceptable description of an un@@ acceptable description . according to the police of the police are the share of f@@ ender drivers , the nation@@ wide in accidents , but quite cause for worry . &quot;
&quot; in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Ky@@ oto , for example were caused in 2005 1.9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents of Sen@@ i@@ oren . this corresponds to a share of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , caused by the Senate of the Senate 1,8@@ 03 of a total of 11.@@ 850 inj@@ uries . &quot;
so that its share rose to 17,@@ 7 % .
&quot; while the number of accidents has fallen in total , the proportion of seniors caused by Sen@@ iors are increased in the same period . &quot;
&quot; the named Re@@ porter brought in the version of the article comments to light , which show which pre@@ judi@@ ces couple of Japanese is seem@@ ingly opposed to older drivers : &quot;
the article on Yahoo about the translation error has the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; fur@@ n@@ able drivers &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; S@@ lack@@ ly , the translation is not at all , or ? &quot;
- I don &apos;t find that that is a true translator .
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so common in Asia
translation errors are widely used in Japan and Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a true discovery for these bizar@@ re errors in English .
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Andrew .
the reasons for wide spread of translation errors are mani@@ fold .
&quot; to commit , you need two important abilities : passive voice ways to understand the output text and to active language skills to transfer it into the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active master@@ y of the target language - something that is in the case , in general the convic@@ tion that transl@@ ators should be in the target language - not in the source language - mother@@ tongue . &quot;
&quot; so , a French mother tongue , was to translate into French in French - not from French to French . &quot;
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Karl Bar@@ on .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ workers in English as a native language , the translations into English . this may be attri@@ buted to serious understanding of the survival , cost reasons or the relatively low number of English mother tongue , the pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; some companies who have not have foreign employees , leaving translations yet . then the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge will be considered the best to transl@@ ators - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really good . &quot;
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Karl Bar@@ on .
automated translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the wor@@ sen@@ es and mysterious pro@@ positions that arise through machine translation that this technique can not replace a long range of human transl@@ ators . this applies to some languages very special .
&quot; some of the wei@@ rd English word@@ ings in Japan , including also the mysterious re@@ prints which often used T @-@ shirts or pockets , are only used for cl@@ assy reasons - not to be read or understood at all . &quot;
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation error may be un@@ acceptable or at least harm@@ less . but by big companies or from the government who have funds to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations . &quot;
the city of Ky@@ oto is using a serious source of their translations into the future .
Venezuela : prot@@ est and ens@@ wear measures on the internet and television

&quot; other online transm@@ itter recordings of the protests in Car@@ acas , which were organized by op@@ position@@ ists groups that the government of Nicol@@ Ã¡@@ s Ma@@ du@@ ros . &quot;

in Paraguay are many girls to sla@@ ve to receive a training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child a cri@@ adi@@ ta . now she visited the house in which she worked for years .
&quot; today Tina is fighting for the rights of children and coll@@ ects stuff , which is exactly how they were victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the short@@ ened version of a report of course , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors . &quot;
&quot; the article is part of a series called &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ uel@@ an , es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que CAEN &quot; ( &quot; tile cows , dec@@ aying schools &quot; ) , edited by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America and will be re@@ published . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household , in which they did not live together with the family who lived there , eat . &quot;
just before her studies at the University she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her . she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; that , out of which has become something , &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated in this house as a daughter .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she started working as a cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as a Cri@@ adi@@ ta is called the more than 46.@@ 000 boys and girls that are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money over@@ looks their min@@ der@@ old son or her min@@ ors &apos;s daughter to another , rich@@ ly family . in the thousand , the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned , is that the children must do so many days house@@ work that can never be paid and victims of abuse and mis@@ ery - and all that in the context of a contract you can not lift . &quot;
this as a cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go practice is widely spread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organizations .
&quot; after completion of her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organisation that is fighting for the rights of the boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , they talked with cri@@ adi@@ tas - above all young girls are affected by the practice of cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - sam@@ pler stuff , research@@ ed and p@@ ran@@ ger@@ te . &quot;
&quot; she tried to name things in the name , because the feeling of Grati@@ tude , which is not shr@@ unk to the Cri@@ adi@@ tas . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ z@@ az@@ go is based on a double de@@ ception , explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family who join her daughter in faith that they have so their training to improve their position in society and make something out of itself to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family who takes up the girl with themselves and justified its exploitation by faith that she would give someone a chance who otherwise do not get education and might even be hun@@ gry . &quot;
the victims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl fails to learn his family only many years later .
sometimes they will never learn about it .
&quot; in January 2016 it has been a relatively unknown phenomenon that takes place in sec@@ rec@@ y in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face . &quot;
&quot; as Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº in the hospital , her body showed traces of fier@@ ce be@@ ats . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
it was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former Mil@@ Ã¡@@ s F@@ errei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo that works as be@@ et@@ tin in the inhabitants .
&quot; Mar@@ Ã­n lived in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small town with only 3,@@ 000 inhabitants at the east of the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , F@@ errei@@ ra proposed with a stick on Mar@@ Ã­n , until they thre@@ w fat@@ al injury . &quot;
this should be the last order in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported on the inci@@ dent .
they emphas@@ ised that the mor@@ ed child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organisations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made deep responsibility in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Society for the death of the girl .
they read the cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of sla@@ very . &quot;
several do@@ zen men came to prot@@ est prot@@ est together and demanded that there is no other Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay are more cows than children , &quot; def@@ endant Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
without papers it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
&quot; without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbours of the couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a rapid examination of the fall .
&quot; they want the Tom@@ Ã¡@@ s F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl , which was condem@@ ned to 30 years in prison . &quot;
&quot; if the case is coming to judgment , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n o shall be the case for the first time in the history of Paraguay , a case of Cri@@ z@@ az@@ go ahead . &quot;
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
&quot; the Cri@@ adi@@ ans are not only explo@@ ited as labour forces , they also live isolated from other girls at their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ si was working in her father , which she had to sign up and her father lost his work . &quot;
&quot; their brothers had to go all works and began to sell on the road or on the market , to make money . &quot;
but they all went further to the school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
in the house of her employers Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
&quot; in doing so , she had to share the time so that you were still learning to learn . &quot;
it was standing every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employer .
&quot; Fri@@ days for example puri@@ fy them the refrigerator , p@@ opping the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the ground . &quot;
when the school was at the end she went home again and had time to learn .
&quot; the more they finish with the learning , the more time had it . &quot;
but even this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says it never had to go hun@@ gry , but also not unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the landlord as food from the fridge . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belong@@ ed to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ is@@ ants of the Parti@@ al Liber@@ al , a liberal party who was held during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; to some down@@ forc@@ ing the landlord Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , beside him and to read and editorial out of op@@ posi@@ tions@@ ences such as &quot; transm@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo &quot; . &quot; &quot;

legisl@@ ations writes the Egyptian users of social media in front of the government
picture of Pix@@ ab@@ ay is changed by Global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty @-@ Egyptian parliament@@ arians have recently agreed to a bill &apos;s regul@@ ating with regard to the usage and usability of social networks .
&quot; if he is accepted by the Parliament , user will need to register users with social media in Egypt with a government authority in order to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , then there would be a place to be set up , to charge citizens and to use social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months with acceptance of the law , users would have to be able to register users with their correct name and pay@@ roll numbers to be able to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; will it be dre@@ amed to do this , this could be a pun@@ ishment of up to six months harbour or an ATM . &quot;
&quot; the Leg@@ isl@@ ative Dec@@ ree , consisting of six par@@ rots and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent cur@@ ated , defines social media as &quot; any application , which is running on the Internet and used to communicate with others using voice , vide@@ on@@ ach@@ ing and text . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear how the law is per@@ ished , as the draft will not give notice , as the Egyptian authorities are unable to put the users inside users and users who are not able to register that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure the regulation on the level of social media company . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul saddle , parliament@@ arians and conveyor of law@@ suit , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered user names and users received from tel@@ co @-@ Department and a password to come through the fire@@ wall , the Facebook block@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt is planning to impos@@ e a fire@@ wall at the national level around Facebook . due to which it would be necessary for the Egyp@@ tians and Egyp@@ tians , information on their identity can access to the network . &quot;
yet it has not been known that such plans are .
experts in local experts are skep@@ tical regarding the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; &quot; General researchers &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
&quot; I have greatly committed to the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things , which have to do with technology . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , they make it so before , that just as they do violent physical public and private spaces , it could be done online . &quot;
&quot; when I take them seriously , then this means that they will apply a strong surveillance system to apply citizens or not . and that means a reference system to monitor the activities of the people and to bring them to a judi@@ cial process . &quot;
this is technically not all realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; to be adopted by law , the draft must first be discussed at the legislative Parliament and the Constitu@@ tional committees before it comes to the plenary . &quot;
&quot; whether his acceptance and enforcement shall be successful or not , the draft &quot; is consistent with a pro @-@ military mind@@ art in parliament , in which sense the control is maxim@@ ised and ensured that does not have a separate cl@@ amping on the image area , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;

&quot; a sub@@ type of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , who belong by Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sa@@ xi@@ color ) . overall , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and the frag@@ mentation of their habitat , and since they are becoming less lo@@ ot . &quot;
why is this particular kind of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
&quot; like R@@ aza in the video shows , &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the Kur@@ dish eco@@ system &quot; and the health and the thought of the eco@@ system depends also on that a big ro@@ b@@ animal is available . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ards in fact is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video is therefore determined that they have a shot of a big cat in the Camer@@ af@@ all , cr@@ ying re@@ aza in pure joy . &quot;

&quot; at the beginning of March 2017 , the progress made for the north @-@ east Japanese Sh@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o who have been met in the last six years to re@@ build the lives of those who were trig@@ gered by the &quot; &quot; triple disaster &quot; &quot; of March 2011 . an enormous earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an at@@ om accident in Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a had trig@@ gered the catastrophe . &quot;
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung has its headquarters in ship@@ ai that lies in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a great pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan to Nor@@ the@@ ast that both experience the earthqu@@ akes and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and neighbouring pr@@ ag@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a and I@@ w@@ ate were forced by the ts@@ un@@ ami all the coastal cities of the map disappear .
&quot; in addition , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a lived an atom@@ ic accident , even alone than 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses . &quot;
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o shows from local view which progress has been achieved for six years to re@@ build the lives of the town .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of the Japanese re@@ unification and a survey results of the people themselves .
the accomodation in Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper reported that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned spare parts ( both of the basis , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the Pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures could see Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , here 80 percent of the planned spare parts were finished . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has 75 per cent of such houses , evalu@@ ates Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a with 70 percent of the final light . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , one always tries to convert six years after the disaster , ev@@ acu@@ ated by j@@ acu@@ ated by Beh@@ lu@@ sion @-@ accommodation ( both @-@ hour , flo@@ ets@@ u ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in final spare parts . &quot;
after the triple catastrophe almost 80 000 people were forced to live in Beh@@ ind accommodation .
&quot; in December 2016 , 36 000 people lived from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a and I@@ w@@ ate in such remedies . &quot;
&quot; nearly 40 percent of the year 2011 Ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a still live in emergency , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was successful here . more than 75 per cent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated that came to the disaster in Beh@@ ind accommodation , were converted into final houses . &quot;
for I@@ w@@ ate the number here is at 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected dent@@ ures
&quot; how the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung has been able to find 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , which were affected by the Un@@ gl@@ Ã¼ck until December 2016 , which makes almost 98 percent of schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; six years later , the industrial reconstruction is much more difficult in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; while almost 100 percent of fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i have now returned to farm , have been restored in Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a only 30 percent of fisheries @-@ mar@@ inas . &quot;
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atom@@ ic accident in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural agricultural large @-@ scale in compassion .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas where only 66 percent of the A@@ cker@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed the A@@ cker@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a .
&quot; it is un@@ likely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear inci@@ dent , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed by Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , lie in the &quot; nuclear @-@ zone &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism grew again and again re@@ be@@ aten , but also here remains Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a far off . &quot;
&quot; the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back to 90 percent at the same stand , as before the Un@@ gl@@ Ã¼ck . Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , on the other hand can only be 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper also reported that since the disaster almost half of the coastal mates , it is harder to make their way of living . &quot;
is the local people prepared for the next major earthquake ?
&quot; to determine a total picture , the newspaper articles led numerous surveys under the native population and under the ev@@ acu@@ ated by . she asked about the state of the re@@ build and also how their sens@@ ation to the ts@@ un@@ ami risk has changed . &quot;
in her introduction of the article the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Newspaper :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o conducted a survey by to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the local population .
&quot; the survey brought that 8@@ 3.1 percent of the population resident , measures have taken to be prepared to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; however , 5@@ 5.9 percent of the respon@@ dents that still has not been done enough in terms of disaster prevention . &quot;
how it stands for those who had to ev@@ acu@@ ated from the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a
&quot; in its edition to the anniversary of the earthquake , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung has strengthened its attention also on the situation of the ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a had not only had to experience the massive earthquake and dev@@ ast@@ ating t@@ sun@@ ami , no , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a was also witness of the worst , dis@@ asters , atom@@ ic dis@@ co@@ d , the Japan ever had to experience . &quot;
&quot; from 160 000 ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , almost 63 000 people were scattered abroad outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 , there were a little more than 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , in permanent spare parts . &quot;
&quot; after the state of 2017 , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; in the disaster areas , most of the ev@@ acu@@ ated , which still prev@@ ail over 50 years old . they have to compete in the right housing , because the efforts to re@@ build Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a with massive construction projects . this is a part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020 . &quot;

&quot; if people meet people from other countries , which seem to speak a different language seem to be larger than the simil@@ arities . &quot;
after a while you can often recognize that one more links than it seems at first glance .
&quot; these global connections are important as they challenge our pre@@ judi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at this global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we cover themes which often get less attention in the coverage than they deserve . &quot;
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember to a moment in which they have felt very strong with someone over language and coun@@ ties .

&quot; in the pictures also the face of the police officers , which is identified with a stroke force . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;

Go@@ i@@ Ã¡@@ s was not the only state in Brazil in which it came from Friday to bru@@ tal police tions against prot@@ esters .
polic@@ emen put in protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro where prot@@ esters were er@@ ected a stage for speakers , Gum@@ mig@@ rant and Tr@@ Ã¤n@@ eng@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the Euro Fl@@ avi@@ o Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( PS@@ OL ) , bat the police via lou@@ d@@ speaker to reno@@ unce violence against prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Bra@@ zi@@ lian media street prot@@ est ver@@ t by taking the focus on another , un@@ expected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window @-@ disk . &quot;
&quot; the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported specifically on a cru@@ de glass window , to shape with a photo their front pages illustrations . &quot;
&quot; against it , the O Glo@@ bo preferred a front story with a set on brand @-@ set bus . &quot;
&quot; there is no pl@@ au@@ sible journ@@ alist reason , more about a broken window than the protests of thousands , which serve the defence of a special cause . &quot;
&quot; this must also be seen , if you do strictly against any form of damage . &quot;
&quot; also here the term &quot; &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; receives a absur@@ d , di@@ spro@@ por@@ tion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violence of the military police are referred to by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters in confront@@ ation with the police . &quot;
the for@@ eig@@ alisation of for@@ ested villages in Cuba
&quot; with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , in all Cuba the doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ AT@@ IS@@ TA ) &quot;
&quot; the Bay Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , which is located in the western Cub@@ an Province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - at Spanish sugar mill - regardless of that there is no n@@ enn@@ able sugar @-@ harvest spot . &quot;
&quot; it is two years ago , when the activities were laid down in the sugar can@@ opy roof . &quot;
&quot; after the proceeds stood the sugar can@@ opy in the region , and the factory lay down and after its plants , until only the sm@@ ells out of steel and concrete remained left . &quot;
about 272 workers had to be re@@ inv@@ ented .
some are rarely the work .
&quot; other res@@ ort@@ ed and p@@ end@@ ling daily to factories , which is still ma@@ hlen . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ene , a sol@@ dier veter@@ an , who stopped every day at 4 : 00 am , the crisis in the sugar tube industry does not inher@@ ited his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that in the east of the region of sugar tube , who are back in operation after long in@@ active time , because they were preserved . &quot;
that was something that he was not expected .
N@@ ene remember exactly that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ ich I would receive the sugar can@@ opy factory but the promise was not kept .
&quot; the sugar @-@ built industry already resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market price , the in@@ effici@@ encies and climate change . &quot;
&quot; 2016 , the production was 1,6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a mot@@ if for a couple of decades ago for the country , but the bad harvest has already been no news anymore . &quot;
why was the Cub@@ an sugars have turned off ?
the old railway station of the municipality looked at better times .
( picture : Ju@@ lio B@@ AT@@ IS@@ TA )
&quot; the reduction of sugar tube was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar can@@ opy were technically for@@ ged , and hardly competitive they were in@@ compatible for the country . &quot;
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories that was an annual production target was 4 million tons .
they just left the factories that sugar can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 euros ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the moti@@ ves that led to such measures were the little productivity of the sugar can@@ ons and the sugar crisis on the world market .
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar price increased about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 the price of uncomfortable sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 report &quot; &quot; Agric@@ ultural Academy &quot; from the OECD and FA@@ O , agricultural and nutri@@ ent organisation of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if the current production would achieve the level of 2001 ( 3,@@ 6 million tons ) , the raw material export would be about 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will come with certainty into history , these were the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from there , the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , the breast@@ feeding of 98 sugar can@@ opy came down to more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training . &quot;
the same happened in the sugar can@@ opy Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto P@@ Ã©@@ rez has worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as sol@@ dier about the closure of the factory , the word he is most repeated , &quot; fraud &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; nearly all respon@@ dents are the same opinion : not one of them has been informed that the factory was removed . &quot;
&quot; thus , the place will be preserved , they show a full time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first closing year , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially noted , which would only be removed concerning the parts that would be removed , the Ad@@ res@@ sat and the date . &quot;
all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could take any de@@ part . &quot;
from there the responsibility was convic@@ ted and the letters have always been more common .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for two years for the still@@ ed factory and he was one who received the letters . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for the Pen@@ sion@@ ing in another facility , the Bor@@ is Luis Santa Colom@@ a . &quot;
he was against his will at the lact@@ ation of the factory as he helped the construction he helped .

first Nations young people use Hip Hop Hop to express themselves and maintain their own culture
recording of a song of &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Hi@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an .
&quot; young people of the First Nations Communities in all Canada are concerned with themes that are important for them . they do it by means of Hip Hop , thanks to a number of hi@@ kers . &quot;
&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an Tour since 2014 Work@@ shop@@ leaders mobile sound studios directly to schools and youth centers , to accommodate youth groups , song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live appear@@ ances since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were led by the ped@@ ago@@ gues David Ho@@ d@@ ges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North @-@ Queb@@ ec with ten Cre@@ e @-@ Hop and then worked with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop Group The North@@ stars together . &quot;
&quot; the workshop ends that the young participants in discussions like &quot; cultural identity , language , meditation , love , self @-@ sec@@ ession , or whatever they are always found in mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos where young people are the main ones .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team worked with other First Nations Communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of the W@@ inn@@ eb@@ ago in the U.S. federal state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o , in the area of the tribe of the kit@@ al@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , such as the history of the Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of Tr@@ ears , &quot; , on which almost two do@@ zen mostly indigenous young women van@@ ished or mur@@ dered . &quot;
the cases were largely unknown .
&quot; the next video of the Nem@@ aska Cre@@ e First Nation uses the mot@@ ive of a video player to conv@@ ey , how important to preserve traditional customs and customs despite the influences . &quot;
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages although the young people are not still dominant in the language of the First Nations .
&quot; in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation have recorded , the ref@@ rain is sung on Cre@@ e . &quot;
the young people involved got some help from Gary Jolly from the North@@ stars Hip Hop Group which gave them a st@@ rop@@ he at the Di@@ al@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
&quot; on the Fac@@ ebook@@ page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an stands in tran@@ script , as a translation into English , which is translated into English : &quot;
&quot; sometimes I feel , when would not ever be interested in me . &quot;
but I try to go on earth for my days
this is the day where you will take our cry .
because we have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise to one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
&quot; thus , they can grow and take up of our youth as well as our youth . &quot;
&quot; so , they can do that , what to them the Creator has to be determined . &quot;
&quot; in the commentary box , the reader and author of the Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also has a contribution and adds the st@@ rop@@ he in Sil@@ ben@@ ign ( which is also published on his blog and published here with a permit ) : &quot;
plastic meals are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic meals ( on @-@ stage ) : both of the same standard and in Japan ) out of a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan one can see almost every restaurant sculp@@ tural dishes .
&quot; to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu , are located near the entrance hall sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ oc@@ u ( both of the same level ) of every spok@@ es@@ person issued in this restaurant is served . &quot;
customers can see these plastic meals and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry that is devoted to the production of this plastic meals .
in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi there is a large number of these small businesses who manufactured from the German fil@@ mm@@ akers W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a in over 20 years ago .
&quot; for most Japan these plastic meals are so common that they are not even more noticeable . a new trend , however , it turns into stri@@ king cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
&quot; at Nav@@ er Mat@@ ome published the blog@@ ger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos , which show this unusual T@@ wist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
&quot; now in the special sale : new with plastic gr@@ ated decorative cell bands , as shown in K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; many of these artificial foods were turned to kit@@ sch@@ y coll@@ ects , as in this case , mag@@ net mag@@ net : &quot;
here are a few sho@@ ots mag@@ net for a new exhibition at Tokyo @-@ Station .
the new b@@ oom of the Essen@@ ti@@ fications is increasingly pro@@ long@@ ed .
in this case a k@@ ais@@ en @-@ don ( a popular ring shell with seafood ) has been transformed into a cell line .
for these tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as mobile phones .
we also made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo &apos;s station .
and here is an apple that keeps your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to watch like an apple with a guy for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that is just the beginning of an increasing flight back .
&quot; some mobile phones and mobile phone allow you to produce your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura or salmon being used , a popular tub@@ ular , which is served with white ri@@ ce . &quot;
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; is there someone who would say : &quot; Wow , cool , now I can declare my mobile phone with salmon ? &quot;
I think I will probably be the one .
&quot; this interest in plastic geri@@ es can also assume a less appe@@ tiz@@ ing form to surprise for example , colleagues or family members un@@ pleasant . &quot;
our new mobile phone @-@ stand has the form of mel@@ ted ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also Rei@@ mp@@ y ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , ear@@ rings and hand@@ y@@ bands out of dried salmon . &quot;
further sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile plastic meals can be viewed at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Nav@@ er Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter to the has@@ ht@@ ag # 4 .
&quot; if you would like to know more about the origin of this trends , then this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , who is dedicated to decor@@ ating the restaurant industry . such as with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ u . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic meals can actually be produced .
a mex@@ ic project tells the stories of the survi@@ vor@@ s of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the struggle against the drug dealers . &quot;

&quot; in reports in@@ - and foreign media about the cr@@ ush &quot; fight against drug trade &quot; in Mexico , the missing and investig@@ ated regularly only in statistics . however , they do not reflect the scale of the human tragedy , that this struggle with itself . &quot;
&quot; reporting on drug bos@@ ses like El Ch@@ apo Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the chef of Sin@@ alo@@ a Kart@@ ells , penet@@ rate the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a non @-@ violent inci@@ dent , there is hardly any one look at the grap@@ e or to the communities who have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; there are behind each body , behind each bone , behind each bone , the stories of great parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , their wo@@ unds may never heal . &quot;
&quot; that is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico live the digital project &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vivi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; with the drug trade &quot; &quot; ) , offering these sacrific@@ es a voice and stories of people who are told in the battle between the prosec@@ ution authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describes the project so :
organised crime not only leaves us to fear our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
&quot; for example , if shops close , because they are threatened by drugs ters , and whole churches have to drive many kilometers to buy something like milk . &quot;
the Pain of victims
a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; like fear life &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
&quot; one main fig@@ ur is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who is a father of the old tom@@ bs according to his Son . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ gu@@ ez , who lost on only one day her father , her four brothers , her husband and two of their ne@@ ph@@ ew . &quot;
&quot; priest : &quot; &quot; like every Sunday we prepare ourselves again on the task we have put forward to go forth and to gra@@ ves , according to the people who we loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Contr@@ er@@ as : &quot; my son called Antonio Ivan Contr@@ er@@ as Mat@@ a .
he was 28 , when he disappeared . &quot;
he has three children .
he worked in a electric shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need a training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , which is also here with me . &quot;
at the moment she has no income .
&quot; you are the assurance of my father , but it does not get paid for them because that a mort@@ ality will require . &quot;
where should we get the cause ?
the editors of &quot; Apr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we must not only show the faces of those who face fear . we must show the international community of conflicts , the frag@@ ile and government . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a lesbian of Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the federal state Gu@@ err@@ ero in central mex@@ iko . &quot;
&quot; your contribution re@@ minded us that you should never look at violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
I know the disease and sens@@ ational journ@@ alism now for several years .
&quot; I come over every day of time and see the front pages with pictures , which actually can only come from a text@@ book for cri@@ min@@ ology or from acc@@ used specialists . &quot;
it brings me out of the version .
&quot; sometimes I have the feeling as if I am the inhal@@ er or sad . it works , as a lack of respect towards the person that the body once belong@@ ed . &quot;
I cannot be indiffer@@ ent or consider this as normal .
it continues to write :
&quot; no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old co@@ us@@ in thinks that he is , if he is great . and it is also not normal that people can hear songs about the &apos; hero@@ ism &quot; of the criminal off@@ ences when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me this is , as if they have lost those who have lost someone and those who have fear that they too happens something . &quot;
I see our weakness if stories to mere numbers in a statistics .
the in@@ eness of the people is unbeliev@@ able for me when the death of six people and the dis@@ appear@@ ances can be justified by 43 students in a neighboring country that they were as@@ ug@@ ly .
I think they are trying to talk that they remain from such trag@@ e@@ dies when they are not stir@@ ring and silent .
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico @-@ Stadt wrote the post &quot; Vi@@ er months Er@@ pres@@ sur@@ ge in Hauptst@@ adt@@ kultur@@ ens : how a family with threats was prono@@ unced . it describes how armed criminal month for month money was destroyed by their business , until they end not only the business , but also their family apart . &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and how many people can change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; pain about it never goes , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes back high , if you are alone . &quot;
habits have changed to phone numbers also .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the further we are removed , the better . &quot;
she sh@@ aded her report with the words :
&quot; we want that the others are arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they lead you , or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself in this fur@@ ious days , whether wines would solve my deep@@ ened feelings , but the answers is no , because I have forgotten how to cri@@ t . I must learn to live with the pain . &quot;
the journ@@ alist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the post &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : one of violence . &quot;
&quot; in the introduction he raises questions on how : who takes care of the child of a missing woman and a man , which was mur@@ dered by organised crime ? &quot;
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the endanger@@ ing city of Mex@@ ik@@ os ?
he is not like other boys of his age whose parents worry about them .
&quot; bry@@ an is a sc@@ ise and he told that he had to bring themselves how to live a egg , pot@@ atoes and &quot; Ch@@ ich@@ i &quot; for the babies , tor@@ till@@ as and &quot; Ch@@ ich@@ i &quot; for the babies with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for each one year .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence and he had to learn to live .
&quot; when he was five years old , he said to him that his mother disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood has been past two years earlier , when he was removed only a few blocks from his home , the blo@@ ody cor@@ ks of his father saw that by armed men had been shot out of a gay car . &quot;
&quot; as Bry@@ an was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
bry@@ an was born in 2006 as violence by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most vulnerable city in the world due to the number of states for public safety and the Government of the Government of the United States . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the prosec@@ ut@@ or 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to the inc@@ ision 8,5 Mor@@ als per day . &quot;
&quot; these are just some of hundreds of hundreds of stories that organised crime in Mexico , and entered into the soul of the country . &quot;
only a few stories are living in the face of getting new head@@ lines . this project does not look forward to those who we cannot forget .
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vivi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; has established a Nar@@ ac@@ data project of Nar@@ co@@ data in life , whose objective is to tor@@ ate the complex information behind the drug trading , which has been tor@@ tured in the past four decades , in a matter of understand@@ able manner . &quot;
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Flick@@ r @-@ users Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ strÃ¶@@ m ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) WAR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages which he linked , contain images , on which violence is shown . &quot;
&quot; the Fak@@ ten@@ check is important at a moment in which it is about to lift up a sm@@ ells , or for@@ getting a f@@ ake . &quot;
&quot; but what is the years after something the first time is res@@ ur@@ faced ? content in social media , no matter if true or un@@ true , it is further to pers@@ ist . &quot;
let us take this photo of a terrible in@@ case before seven years in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its first publication , it has been mis@@ leading to illustr@@ ate trag@@ e@@ dies that actually have taken place in Nigeria or My@@ an@@ mar . &quot;
this false p@@ air@@ ing of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - den@@ ies not the fact that there are plenty of careful reporting about events in the DR Congo , My@@ an@@ mar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it thro@@ ws questions about our desire for pictures to messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
2010 through a tank @-@ wag@@ on the place S@@ ange in the East of the DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ te and explo@@ ded . there were 230 people in life . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war of Africa , Africa has been negl@@ ected to negl@@ ected land for years , and thereby h@@ ated . the streets in the region have become a dangerous paths full of service holes , which were difficult to drive . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it fell victim to the victim of the tank @-@ wag@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; declared a fire@@ ball described a fire@@ ball , the frag@@ rant houses , including a cin@@ em@@ as nearby , which was full of people who looked at the so@@ ccer world . &quot;
houses con@@ ru@@ sted and short@@ ened cor@@ p@@ ses in the streets scattered .
many people were bur@@ nt to ignor@@ ance .
a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria &quot; . of Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ users My@@ s@@ tical Mon@@ key , 12 January 2015.@@ multiple photos of the inci@@ dent form the gray scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows em@@ bos@@ sed body that are mounted on the ground while people they look at .
but here the story does not find their end .
&quot; over the years the same photo were posted several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , but not related to the trag@@ e@@ dies , in particular events in Nigeria and My@@ an@@ mar . &quot;
what happened in Nigeria and My@@ an@@ mar
on 3 January 2015 attacked fighters of B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am the ent@@ leg@@ ia villages B@@ aga and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
eye @-@ witnesses reported dras@@ tically from atro@@ cities where they had to fle@@ e .
houses and shops were burned down and body names used in streets and prayer .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 up to 2,@@ 000 people have been mass@@ ac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; however , the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; nobody remained back to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; said a population about Human Rights Watch . &quot;
many were disp@@ el and burned or burned .
only using satellite pictures could be illustr@@ ated by the following time .
&quot; the occasion for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the Ar@@ me@@ tic@@ point in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am , land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
and here the image from the DR Congo has come back to it as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented :
this is Nigeria .
a mass@@ ac@@ re of 2.000 people took place two days to Paris .
they are not Charlie .
you are dead .
&quot; in fact , these abu@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of mis@@ uses ; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
in all these cases the picture was taken as a cover for mass@@ ages .
&quot; another step further bring personal comments like this example , the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments . &quot;
the image of S@@ ange appeared also in conjunction with the dead@@ ly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in My@@ an@@ mar .
&quot; according to a light@@ ning , published by the United Nations , published by the United Nations , the fle@@ e , r@@ ape , r@@ ape , and et@@ able T@@ ote , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others were reported on the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , called Po@@ sts such as the following on which these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo brought together : &quot;
&quot; this picture was taken from an aci@@ di @-@ Arab message , the President My@@ an@@ mar Th@@ ein S@@ ein has said , mon@@ ks and politicians would have been involved in the ass@@ ass@@ ination of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . additionally it had used the image from the DR Congo to illustr@@ ate this information . &quot;
&quot; the origin@@ ate contribution , which was last updated on 26 April 2017 , can be called here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations which AF@@ P considered their source , also had random Th@@ ein this statement , but not so that the image were brought related to the DR Congo . &quot;
the global range fal@@ con information
traces of this false coupling range up to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from anywhere around the world .
&quot; using a &quot; &quot; revers@@ ed picture &quot; &quot; one can see how far information can cross borders . &quot;
a revers@@ ed picture with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found at 18.@@ 8 billion images ( Stand of 3 May 2017 ) 344 images found that the bes@@ ieg@@ ed picture from the DR Congo are very similar .
&quot; it origin@@ ates from a mis@@ ch@@ mas@@ ch private pages , platforms social media and community as well as national publications and are in many different languages like English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
some have sent false reports to disc@@ ern@@ ed others have attemp@@ ted to dism@@ iss the for@@ geri@@ es .
&quot; we have set examples for the miss@@ able use and brought them into connection with the respective countries , on which side they were published . thus , we want to represent the range more clearly than by the language alone . &quot;
from the countries listed below ( which in some cases were also associated with each other ) can be several examples of miss@@ able use .
&quot; here some cases , which can now be completely eliminated ( on the map in orange ) : &quot;

examples of incorrect coupl@@ ings of the picture from the DR Congo with Nigeria or My@@ an@@ mar .
&quot; the mem@@ oran@@ ent countries point out to pages or server , on the examples of for@@ geri@@ es or fal@@ seh@@ ood are still available . &quot;
&quot; the countries in grey are examples , which are according to the met@@ ad@@ ata and information that are available through Tin@@ Eye , probably also for@@ eig@@ ners . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Bur@@ ma - My@@ an@@ mar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo has been posted in an online discussion forum ( directed themselves to Algeria and interested Arab@@ s ) as part of a thread to the &quot; war of Budd@@ hist@@ s against Muslims . &quot;

&quot; this communication site said that the President of My@@ an@@ mar Th@@ ein S@@ ein 2012 , that mon@@ ks and politicians were involved in the pot@@ ent of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims , and brought the story with the image . &quot;
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the image is to be included in it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article from 2014 on students , which were brought by the B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am , published by the B@@ ok@@ lis@@ is Digital , has expressly declar@@ es that the picture does not come from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; &quot; similar d@@ hi@@ des attack &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the picture later in connection with the mass@@ ac@@ re of B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am of 2015 in relocation , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to res@@ ist that it would be connections to Nigeria . &quot;

&quot; the picture of the DR Congo emerg@@ es , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ has@@ ht@@ ag , to and delet@@ es a discussion among Muslims , after the mass@@ ac@@ re of B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am 2015 and on the occasion of Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to achieve that their communities found these events , the mut@@ acy in the name of Islam , a greater attention . &quot;
United States of America .
the image has been tor@@ tured as a letter for the mass@@ ac@@ re of B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times ret@@ we@@ et@@ et ) . but the messages that were associated with no religious context .
&quot; instead , the aim was to establish attention to the relative number of the dead and one comparison of the media reporting in comparison of Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
Vietnam ( East ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message , the suppos@@ edly was written by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an mass@@ ac@@ re , over@@ head it discussion , as this here on Vietnamese and explained it to fal@@ con . &quot;
&quot; from the message that was included in the picture from the DR Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ iner Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os . &quot;
&quot; there are further confirmed examples of an faul@@ ty use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; for other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sides in the following countries ( on the fl@@ ap in grey ) shows Tin@@ Eye also , but are no longer fully re@@ tr@@ ace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with URLs and time stamp exist on the web@@ cra@@ w@@ ler and negoti@@ ated them on image dram@@ as in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , which appeared only after the original year of 2010 , the picture is finally released a correct description but the original text is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and pictures
there are two strong topics or frames ( locals ) which under@@ go these po@@ sts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in relation to major discussions about silence in connection with the re@@ visions of Christians through Muslims or - to defend Muslims - the re@@ visions of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hist@@ s .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how a African life is evaluated compared to a European or French life .
religion should be understood and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth seeing how pictures can be used in connection with these efforts .
&quot; however , a deeper question is what happens if readers cannot give this pictures longer believ@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; with social media there are two people who have un@@ inten@@ tional share , the water round about a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; sug@@ gest@@ ates this mood of missing and false information , that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and tast@@ ed the actual picture of what actually happened in the DR Congo , in Nigeria and My@@ an@@ mar ? &quot;
the spread of non@@ violent images has already been released in detail ( here for example ) .
an argument is that the back@@ ward appearance of pictures of an apple comes to recognize the tragedy . bis@@ cuits that these images will even be demanded by the victims themselves .
&quot; at the same time , the concern that non @-@ violent images reader and spect@@ ators are des@@ si@@ zing and give them the ability to emp@@ t Emp@@ athy and how violent media work on how to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to discuss violent represent@@ ations in the news media , the fact that it is indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
Techn@@ ologist experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . you will be cont@@ acted on the situation in which a picture is somewhat suggests that actually it can be dis@@ solved by the context or on completely miss@@ able species .
any investigation into false supplements should also be taken into account as internationally they can .

&quot; a blog with the name un@@ transl@@ ating ( e.g. D@@ t. un@@ matched ) attempts to offer voice @-@ enthusiastic a selection of words from all over the world , who are difficult or not to translate at all . &quot;
such words are in any language : they press certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
&quot; some of these un@@ matched words are already well known ( like the famous Portuguese aci@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply root@@ ed in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ brake ) . &quot;
but all contra@@ sts are st@@ ub@@ st@@ ful every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; one word or expression is not enough , why a complete explanation and sometimes some context is required to understand exactly what is meant by that one word . &quot;
these unique words were collected quite a while in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , during the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ transl@@ atable &quot; St@@ even Bird decided to concentrate on small languages . &quot;
in the blog you can find example words from the VAT &apos;s language of V@@ anu@@ at@@ u as :
v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Bem@@ an to have your parents in recognition of how to endeav@@ or for you in your younger years .
&quot; and words in the Hun@@ s@@ rik language , which are spoken in parts of Brazil as : &quot;

in Bir@@ ds own words from his blog About :
&quot; you gr@@ inder other cultures , covers other thought @-@ length and wake up our cur@@ iosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you influence , how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page still want to show more of these &quot; un@@ matched &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these little languages are . &quot;

how Sri Lanka linked to the worst floo@@ ds of the decade
the island of Sri Lanka looks at the moment of the worst high @-@ water and dru@@ mmer disaster in this decade .
&quot; trig@@ gered by Mon@@ key , which usually set in late May , are by strong ra@@ ins the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , N@@ il@@ wal@@ a and Att@@ an@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country over the banks . &quot;
&quot; after an opinion of the disaster of Sri Lanka from 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and barely hundreds of people are missing because of the floo@@ ds and mud . &quot;
over 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100 000 people have been brought to 304 safe positions .
&quot; the ra@@ ins left on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the water@@ stands in some areas went slowly . &quot;
health and hygiene benefits of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected areas and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos conv@@ ey an impression of the extent of the rivers disaster :
high water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water supply of up to 7,5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka Twe@@ et provide regular updates for high water level . &quot;
many use the has@@ ht@@ ag # Flo@@ od@@ SL to monitor the scale of the catastrophe .

also various organisations and start @-@ ups have travelled the way to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Rel@@ ief - Information Desk@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on high water situation and humanitarian aid .
&quot; if any search and lif@@ egu@@ ences are required for their operations , please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 . &quot;

&quot; similarly , they have led a &quot; &quot; S@@ OS &quot; &quot; key that had more than thousand requests and 150 successful boats actions for high water and black@@ boards in@@ closed people . &quot;
&quot; the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lan@@ kas , where several social media platforms are fully exhau@@ sted , they bring residents in need in need in need for security and support . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of further human life , whereby the population of Sri Lan@@ kas are now the long way to restore norm@@ ality . &quot;

the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ ha@@ zi .
uti@@ liz@@ ing it in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighb@@ our and love girlfriend .
&quot; I trust my four year old daughter , she trust me their children ; she is my rock in the bran@@ ding . &quot;
in that one minute we call for the rights of women .
in the next steps we protect rights for trans@@ gender .
&quot; we are located in a sea of Reg@@ ensch@@ ir@@ men and men , some hold the ic@@ onic image of a woman with head tow@@ el , bound by an American flag , other sk@@ ill@@ nesses to Islam@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks me and says , &quot; these things concern not you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims , I ask me . &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
&quot; people , with whom I work or people who know me for years - the Sah@@ ar that they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has established itself in their idea . &quot;
you ab@@ domin@@ ate me .
there are 1.9 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practic@@ ing our religion differently .
we identify ourselves to be Muslim to different kind . but somehow we will put all in the same Muslim drawer .
&quot; this drawer is well constructed in our collective conception , that once Muslims , which as I do not match there , un@@ mist@@ aken . &quot;
* * * * * * * *
I am not alone with this .
this even has happened to the po@@ et of po@@ etry whose po@@ etry is sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which images come to a sense if you think of it ?
love ?
peace ?
as J@@ al@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now he was a Orthodo@@ x mus@@ li@@ ers pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
&quot; Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were to the day when he died , the center of his po@@ etry . &quot;
&quot; but in the western idea , religion is deleted , as well as the most popular translations of its po@@ etry . &quot;
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of 1.9 billion Muslims from this world .
another consists in the re@@ duction images of Muslims that Western books have been coloni@@ zed for centuries .
this temp@@ ting image is determined by the dark man who ought to fear and the exotic woman that you should save .
&quot; the dispos@@ able Palestinian @-@ American scientists Edward S@@ aid cerem@@ onies , in the 1970@@ s , the story behind these pictures . &quot;
but these pictures also contribute to this today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood ste@@ ady them . &quot;
I have worked for three years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful , faul@@ ty Nar@@ r@@ ative was dominated by our News@@ fe@@ eds . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ rati@@ c over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim Women have led their countries , while the US could not even choose its first female presidential elections . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ rati@@ vely fail to acknowledge that if French , Muslim women are h@@ ated to wear their head tow@@ el in public buildings and acid @-@ Arab , Muslim Women by their government to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
a powerful group exercise its &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; this strong Nar@@ rati@@ c weak@@ ens mus@@ lim@@ ical women , the movements for change . &quot;
&quot; it seems that the first Muslim prayers have been spoken on American ground of Afri@@ cans , which were brought with sla@@ ve . &quot;
it delet@@ es the existence of Que@@ er @-@ Muslims .
&quot; this Nar@@ rati@@ v has occupied our collective pre@@ ference , art deep and faul@@ ty , that often Si@@ k@@ h @-@ men and children have become an@@ tim@@ us@@ li@@ ant attacks and barri@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the other . &quot;
some of the 1,@@ 7 billion include
&quot; in the news industry we do more than just stories to tell , which are based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative ways .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ ative who help us understand the world .
&quot; and my industry is estimated to capture the Nar@@ rati@@ v of the 1,@@ 7 billion . &quot;
and we are here that seven million Muslims make that in the highest degree of &quot; various &quot; religious group in America .
more than one third of the whole Muslim people are African Americans .
&quot; six of ten American Muslims belong to the immig@@ rant of the first generation , coming from 77 countries . &quot;

four decades ago my immig@@ rant parents came to live in New York to live her American dream .
&quot; my mother put her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue before and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scrap@@ ers of New York ; sky@@ scrap@@ ers were made by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Kh@@ an . &quot;
&quot; back then , when Kh@@ an was re@@ covered the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ happy Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now unbeliev@@ able Muslims and American ?
&quot; sometimes , if me wonder why I don &apos;t tell me why I say not a por@@ k , I say - instead of my mus@@ lim@@ ic recipes , or put my hand@@ piece k@@ id to bear all Muslims - &quot; &quot; respect for P@@ epp@@ a w@@ utz . &quot;
I jok@@ ze we carry not all T@@ ash@@ enk@@ or@@ ane with us .
we must also be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be selected almost always for extra safety checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim acti@@ vi@@ sts and inter@@ religious acti@@ vi@@ sts who make efforts to fight widespread lie beyond Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lying are produced at the ongoing band from a well @-@ known Islam@@ Union , Th@@ ink tanks and experts for Fal@@ sch@@ ey , which is our already faul@@ ty image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manip@@ ulated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories that we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ hei@@ d@@ acity in more than just a stran@@ ger who cap@@ tiv@@ ated the head tow@@ el . &quot;

I want to explain that .
&quot; I was born as Muslims , but a Muslim was born only when I was four years old in a provis@@ ional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ial church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when soci@@ alw@@ rit@@ ual life describe their religious life , they refer to the following terms : faith , behaviour and belonging . &quot;
&quot; my mus@@ li@@ ant faith and behavior are perhaps not always visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; maybe my girlfriend , my neighb@@ our , my neighb@@ our in the bran@@ ding that I am Muslims , when they could look through the 15 meters concrete and air you could separate the houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the sole rit@@ ual with my daughter , when I can see them in my arms and to protect the Arab verses to protect the Koran , and called the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
each of them I repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that they are protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my mus@@ li@@ ant faith is probably not always visible , but my Muslim belonging is always a part of my shadow . &quot;

belonging to my grand@@ mother is the image of my grand@@ mother m@@ Ã¼t@@ ter@@ ies with their sisters ; how they win a competition of the art of flor@@ ist closing in Kar@@ achi before decades .
&quot; it is the image of it that I can see at this moment when I close my eyes : Nano , surrounded by its complete and un@@ completed painting Su@@ fi @-@ Hei@@ liger ; and an Kor@@ ans with a lot of book@@ marks , a book with one hundred forty @-@ eight chapters that they can nearly be agile . &quot;
&quot; Muslims , to be able to speak the prayers which she told me when I have a bad day . &quot;
&quot; Muslims him to be as they brought me to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means to my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people , that - over centuries - through a &quot; &quot; emp@@ owerment &quot; , &quot; which has established a company with the name of honor@@ ary bri@@ ini@@ ums @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep meaning to name God , my only Lord . &quot;
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
usage approved .
&quot; belonging , means to grow and listen to that men do not cry , but at the same time that my zu@@ li@@ ly grandfather cri@@ es . &quot;
&quot; stop@@ over , while he writes books about the modern Islam and beyond the independence K@@ mir@@ s writes , w@@ ept N@@ ana Ja@@ an un@@ wo@@ unds to his family in India . me , family , which he did not close into his arms in a half century . &quot;
&quot; belonging to know that there are millions of course and Palestinians , their families , as with my grandfather , from coloni@@ alists have dealt with the Muslim world like at the game risk . &quot;
Muslims and to know that in the last two centuries Europeans have been coloni@@ alized to four mus@@ lim@@ ical countries .
&quot; it means to know that the first fly bom@@ b of history was rejected in a century above a Muslim country . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an indi@@ an , k@@ ash@@ ish sub@@ ordin@@ ate of the British emp@@ ire , was designated by the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous . &quot; he was the first mosque in England . &quot;
&quot; before it was planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and pre@@ ached the radi@@ cal word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

to my Muslim tribe of the 1,@@ 7 billion people goes deep into our unforgettable pedi@@ gre@@ e ; our un@@ incorporated story . &quot;
&quot; it means that four@@ teen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops , who were distributed over every continent apart from the Antarc@@ tic , distributed in Iraq , around weapons of weapons , which did not exist . &quot;
it means to know that more than half millions of I@@ rak@@ er buried bene@@ ath the tru@@ mm@@ ers of the war .
an American Muslims means to know that the self @-@ mor@@ dr@@ ate in the Veter@@ ans have increased by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
&quot; it means to know that when a tragedy in the US is seeking and the susp@@ ects a Muslim names , the story four times is more reported than a story of a white attack . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that before forty years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liber@@ ated black sl@@ aves with the name of Bil@@ al . &quot;
it means knowing that two hundred years ago a African Islamic Islam@@ ist called Bil@@ ali Muhammad failed and brought to this country .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X to a American hero .
&quot; it is the warmth , which I am reading , as humans the airports are crowded to fight against the Muslim B@@ an . &quot;
&quot; it is the hope that I feel , when we stand for our dreams and when we say black lives . &quot;
&quot; to be a Americ@@ an@@ erin , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ jab@@ i , a Pun@@ jab@@ i , a Muslim and a journ@@ alist signi@@ fy identi@@ ties , but to fail to fail them to others . &quot;
&quot; the Nar@@ rati@@ v of the 1,@@ 7 billion bir@@ ths more possibilities than a magic cub@@ es , but is represented in the reduction of it &quot; &quot; against &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; being a mother to be to care my child and all Muslim children , well @-@ knowing that powerful and privileged people on this two @-@ unit structural Islam@@ ism . &quot;
structural Islam@@ ists consists in the mus@@ lim@@ ical regi@@ sters which began with President Bush and led to President Obama .
it consists of integrated monitoring of mos@@ ques .
&quot; it consists in the immig@@ rant , which takes a five years old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
&quot; it consists in a country that includes its borders to people from just the countries , which it bom@@ bed . &quot;
&quot; it is a false and neb@@ ul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ Fly list , &quot; which is largely Arab@@ s and Muslims took into the visor . &quot;
&quot; there are the wars that we lead and the bom@@ bs , which we ab@@ ide on mus@@ lim@@ ic countries . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories that we tell and due to those who we are not telling , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study with the title of A@@ scent of Man , the scientists of the North@@ western University of participants showed a scienti@@ fically unusual picture and b@@ aten them to judge groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution . &quot;
Muslims got the lowest score .
the con@@ greg@@ ations that we have to lead
&quot; we are too deeply dar@@ ing to enth@@ r@@ ise the Muslim or the &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we stand decades back to recognize the roots of our fears and the faul@@ ty and dangerous expression , which we hide in our news actions . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , which tries to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot;
&quot; the Pod@@ cast See S@@ ome@@ thing , S@@ ay S@@ ome@@ thing from Bu@@ zz@@ feed , the vir@@ cast # Good@@ Mus@@ lim@@ b , an initiative , ver@@ t Muslim writers , an initiative , ver@@ y@@ t Muslim writers , Muslim , American Super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope . &quot;

&quot; but I am concerned due to this difficult global timing , where we are in . &quot;
&quot; and this moment has consequences that hin@@ ts over 1,@@ 7 billion . &quot;
&quot; there is a reason that con@@ spir@@ acy , which existed in the dark corner of the Internet , now the White House is now . &quot;
&quot; they have grown ex@@ pon@@ entially , because they have made Muslims to &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is another group that has grown ex@@ pon@@ entially , by creating the &quot; &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a few years ago it had not yet been given ; now they domin@@ ate great areas in Syria and Iraq .
&quot; I am concerned about the re@@ alities and the story that I was not aware of it , as I was as old now my daughter is , but that now my daughter was made today . &quot;
things that I have left here like a b@@ unch cr@@ ust in my speech .
&quot; things that perhaps dis@@ grace , because in all the inter@@ section , which makes our humanity a story , where someone is made to a &quot; &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , in the context of the 8th annual conference to Islam@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; more than one hundred academ@@ ists speak about our problems with the &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but these are no terms , with which we usually throw in our schools for us or we read in our newspapers . &quot;
poster of the Fac@@ ebook@@ page of the Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia Studies Network .
we all have to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why I tell that here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , the man who has demonstrated us how wars are led and people by the thro@@ po@@ ids of &quot; others &quot; in the public presentation , four decades itself was the scientist of Stan@@ ford . &quot;
&quot; we have to realize ourselves uncomfortable questions before the role of being , consci@@ ously and consci@@ ously , as it was my girlfriend and in rain during the women &apos;s March , because of the employment we have no president , the chocolate treat , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1,@@ 7 billion . &quot;

can there be a possibility here and now despite a language barri@@ ers with someone in connection ?
&quot; for St@@ even Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) is the count of stories in their original language a possible answer . &quot;
global Vo@@ ices reported in short of a different initiative by St@@ even Bird , the im@@ over@@ able blog . &quot;
&quot; however , the focus of T@@ LS is not written on the written page but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of big cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS have already carried out for 2015 events , the risk that small and not quite as little languages are not passed on to the bor@@ ns children . &quot;
for the makers of the project :
&quot; the mass@@ age@@ ous of the languages of the world can be avo@@ ided , if we have cities to accept diversity - safe spaces where inhabitants are not forgotten who they are . &quot;
&quot; while listening to it is often related to understand &quot; &quot; understand these events instead &quot; listen to value , to feel too . &quot;
&quot; in this format , histori@@ ans introduce their story in their own language before and translate them in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants have no professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , so they lead their de@@ vot@@ ion and their representation that the audi@@ ences are to be rede@@ emed . &quot;
they call laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; for example , the following video shows a traditional history of Burk@@ ina Fas@@ o , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round the story of the r@@ assi@@ mil@@ ou will also take the opportunity to explain which for their country &apos;s typical customs duties . &quot;
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the F@@ abel from the rab@@ bit and the P@@ avian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zim@@ babwe :
&quot; after having declared the meaning of his F@@ abel , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara asked : &quot; how is it to speak to an audience , which does not understand your language ? &quot; with a broad Gr@@ in@@ sen he shares his sense of inclu@@ siveness : &quot;
you have heard !
you were aware of us ...
they were all with me !
&quot; until now , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling in three cities took place , and the organiz@@ ers hope to expand this . all who are inspired by the project , with T@@ LS in contact to organize their own history . &quot;
Puerto Rico calls for re @-@ determination of citi@@ zenship
&quot; with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which participated in 72 million US dollars , participating in the pu@@ end@@ emic Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went up to the Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ ans . &quot;
it was launched by the group of Fr@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la D@@ eu@@ da &quot; ( Om@@ bud@@ sman for the neur@@ ex@@ am of deb@@ ts ) and the Ã@@ kom@@ bi@@ lical church meeting in Puerto Ri@@ cos .
the inter@@ c@@ ession of the re @-@ determination of deb@@ ts have also submitted a peti@@ tion on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos calls that the politicians , ri@@ bbon and government authorities who are responsible for debt to be held responsible for their cor@@ rupt . &quot;
&quot; we call for a financial test and a line committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding to which in favour of the economy . &quot;
we will be pres@@ um@@ ed and supp@@ res@@ sed .
&quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos refuse to pay a fault , which is not their . &quot;
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not find themselves with sin@@ ful cast@@ ers .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not in the state @-@ level built @-@ in territory of the USA - suffered under a severe financial crisis .
&quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; an governed non @-@ independent non @-@ profit organisation with a focus on soci@@ o @-@ economic development , a law on state @-@ responsibility as an alternative to existing state of state . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ri@@ cos demands a wide restructuring of state infrastructure .
&quot; outside raised measures will be run without the participation and convic@@ tion of the citizen , by the people being rejected . &quot;
the demonstration carried the name &quot; neighb@@ our for light and truth . &quot;

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian Web@@ Develop@@ ers Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over one year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after he was arrested by Syrian regime , his suppor@@ ters and relatives shall continue the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions that he has done for an open network . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s re : pubs , the annual conference on digital Culture , which is conducted in Berlin , devoted to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign . &quot;
&quot; MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a resear@@ cher in France , resident CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , a publisher who produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &apos;s books within three to five days , las@@ en excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective inquiry ( The cost of freedom : a collective re@@ percus@@ sions ) . &quot;
&quot; the book that was published last year , and here is freely available , includes a number of approaches that deal with the free culture in the face of repres@@ sion . &quot;
it is a hom@@ age to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it says :
&quot; this book would like to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge and what the true costs are , with which this is connected . &quot;
&quot; acti@@ vi@@ sts , artists , designers , developers , researchers , and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge , have a side to look over the fo@@ g , which gives our News@@ fe@@ eds and to create something sense from our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to liber@@ ate Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , who loved the beloved and celeb@@ rating Internet volunte@@ ers since March 15th , 2012 . &quot;
&quot; his name was cancelled from the directory of the Ad@@ ra prison , in which he took on 3 October 2015 . &quot;
we have no information about his current state or location .
&quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Coll@@ ective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that want to push for his release , and want to know him back in his normal life and freedom . &quot;
&quot; to see how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us begin to think about their own fate , de@@ eds and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
where have we decided ?
what do we have given extreme convic@@ tions in this process ?
the web development for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in the cust@@ ody sy@@ ris@@ cher government authorities since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 Bass@@ el was transferred from the Ad@@ ra prison , a non @-@ military facility , to an unknown site . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; military pol@@ ish Bass@@ el reported on the basis of a &quot; &quot; strictly secret &quot; &quot; signed command of its cell in Ad@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi reported it was cont@@ acted on 12 November 2015 by individuals , who stood themselves as the in@@ sider of Assad &apos;s government and they took notice of an inn@@ ed death sentence against her husband . &quot;
its location and condition remain unknown .
&quot; a pione@@ er of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a vital role to expand access to the Internet and to know the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ rew , a designer , Techn@@ ologist and currently transferred the manager of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project , the Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
&quot; perhaps none of Bas@@ ics cultural prototyp@@ es predic@@ ted as the work , which he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ constructed the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras . &quot;
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the way of numerous civi@@ liz@@ ations and here wast@@ ed Greek architec@@ tures with hi@@ es@@ y traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time he could not know that ten years after he began with this work , the IS would put all about , this architecture that is not only em@@ bo@@ died the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but of the world . &quot;
&quot; this st@@ aging in the digital ar@@ che@@ ology and conservation has created a newspaper , which will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of inv@@ alu@@ able value . &quot;
&quot; typically , b@@ bel has not yet been able to complete this project yet . &quot;
&quot; N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband , his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I spent my whole life with it , from freedom to dream and bass te@@ aches me to emb@@ race her . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I called his name .
&quot; Bass@@ el brought me to me English , even when he was already in cust@@ ody . &quot;
I learned to read English well and speak English .
&quot; he always has shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked . he has taught other inci@@ dents , English to read and speak . &quot;
Bass@@ el has opened the gate to the technology . he taught me , both computer and smartphones . &quot;
he brought me the internet in me .
&quot; he also brought other inci@@ dents , as they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without that they actually stopped in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( War@@ ten ) , a commission , which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband than he was in cust@@ ody . &quot;
bass and N@@ our@@ a have worked together in the book for a year .
&quot; they tast@@ ed the lyrics to him , when she visited him and he survi@@ ved them from the Arab@@ ian in English . &quot;
the book is license @-@ free .

it happens when you visit , &quot;
&quot; that I lost in the world of your enchanting eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose the b@@ aking in the moment , in which we emb@@ race ourselves , &quot;

I return quickly to my lon@@ eliness , &quot;

the history of history is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the regime of Bas@@ har al @-@ Ass@@ ads are according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( sy@@ ris@@ ches Network for Human Rights ) more than 6@@ ,000 people disappeared . &quot;
&quot; those who were arrested or dis@@ conc@@ iled by the regime , were tor@@ tured or even executed . &quot;
until 2016 we have died at the international human rights organization Am@@ nest@@ y International at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Sy@@ s in cust@@ ody since 2011 .
the stories of many other people are unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
we reiter@@ ate our demand in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Moz@@ ambi@@ que : due to corruption condem@@ ned a director to the prison again on previous post .
Moz@@ ambi@@ cans re@@ acted with Z@@ orn on a cor@@ rupt form in which a ruling member after half of his sentence has returned to the workplace in the state @-@ appar@@ atus and committed to corruption .
&quot; this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , the 2008 arrested and 2010 together with four other indic@@ t@@ ment of 54 million meth@@ tik@@ al ( around 800 000 Euro ) was sentenced to 22 years imprison@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; the money is made from public funds from Mos@@ ambi@@ que , whose Council Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 board . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of good guidance and immediately called his re@@ setting into the company , which was on 19 April then also happened . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with an opinion of the general state of the Republic , which received the request for Cam@@ b@@ aza , there would be no obstacles to refer to Cam@@ b@@ aza , as the company does not over@@ laid his old post . &quot;
&quot; however , many citizens are not good . &quot;
&quot; the centre for public integrity ( Centro de Integrated P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condem@@ ned into an interview with the Deutsche Welle the decision of the company to resume the director : &quot;
&quot; represents a backl@@ ash in the fight against corruption , and is clear@@ ed the lack of transparency and is even a backl@@ ash with regard to the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we take note of knowledge that the company would have a discipl@@ in@@ ative procedure against the ref@@ usal of ref@@ usal .
&quot; however , the company fle@@ w apparently , however , does not constitute reasonable legal steps for applying the appropriate functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the mos@@ ai@@ c social media , bor@@ row@@ ed this behavior also and considers the case as a &quot; resistance &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ b@@ aza a competent type would be advis@@ er , after he was condem@@ ned to a sentence , and that half of them eat . &quot;
&quot; he could hold s@@ paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and be up his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he has sanc@@ ti@@ fied , into the company , he helped to add damage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza is happy to be paid for his silence . &quot;
# { el@@ ap@@ sed }
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambi@@ ance and student of politicians in Brazil says , the director poss@@ esses no mor@@ als : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza by the state rewar@@ ded because he won him rewar@@ ded , I can not believe anyone in such a way that the state has already been so mass@@ aged . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza l@@ acks the mor@@ als and serve the state , * he had already served a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead are only served by themselves at the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state , as a hand it became an in@@ ex@@ haus@@ tible money source and the state itself is tired , which was loaded and finally condem@@ ned to a long sentence . &quot;
&quot; frank@@ ly , I don &apos;t know why this man was rewar@@ ded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te prefer to remember the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remember that a th@@ ief is in prison : &quot;
&quot; Di@@ ebe belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el the mos@@ ambi@@ que will not only be remember@@ ed as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , cap@@ turing and - next to said - proph@@ etic editors . &quot;
&quot; one of its most famous oral portra@@ y@@ als was , when he confirmed energ@@ ically confirmed that &quot; an ambitious person is to be able to sell also the f@@ ather@@ land for its ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ah said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that is not so . he does not change tac@@ tics , but he does not change from his ambi@@ tions . &quot;
an ambitious man is also criminal . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also decre@@ asing :
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was condem@@ ned to 22 years in prison , he sat 10 years and came free . &quot;
&quot; and today it sets him the company , with which he has lost sight , again under the contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - For voc@@ abulary &quot; &quot; ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12 May 2017

Facebook block@@ ed the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in My@@ an@@ mar and zen@@ ens@@ ored many users to inno@@ cent
the Burm@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; means K@@ ich@@ er@@ erb@@ se or sp@@ alter@@ b@@ se .

&quot; according to the information from Facebook @-@ users in My@@ an@@ mar , the known social network took their po@@ sts from the net , because it enth@@ used the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although over the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people &apos;s indigenous origin or in general as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; indi@@ an &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook publish@@ es the word &quot; &quot; Cal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or both of the same level , as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of the h@@ ass@@ language in Bur@@ ma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , the rise of radi@@ cal nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely dism@@ is@@ ite c@@ onn@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word that most commonly used by Ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as H@@ ass@@ speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in My@@ an@@ mar . &quot;
&quot; but in the effort to fight H@@ ass@@ language in My@@ an@@ mar , the company has a lot of meaning@@ ful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; Kal@@ ar &apos;s may normally be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word in itself is not automatically calls forth enc@@ ass@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that also po@@ sts , in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts expressed himself for his use . &quot;
&quot; moreover , there are several bur@@ ial words with different mean@@ ings that have the same book@@ marks as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , the stool is written on &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &apos; ( sp@@ alter@@ b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; cal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ ebook@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
&quot; a post of one of my friends has been deleted today , because he included the word cal@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; however , he had wonder@@ ed his friends on a spiritual way of whether she could know his back pain , by doing a word . &quot;
the sentence ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the Fr@@ age@@ word ( la ) on total - res@@ em@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ ands is the opinion that they will reduce H@@ ass@@ language radi@@ cal nation@@ alists , but also that Facebook analyses , however , before it all Po@@ sts LÃ¶@@ sche , which will spread in the sus@@ pic@@ ion , rac@@ ism . &quot;
Facebook delet@@ es the word &quot; Cal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it filter@@ ed the word automatically .
automation will not understand what you go to Fac@@ be@@ ook .
&quot; what it should do , the post is carefully to analyse and control it by taking the adjacent words . &quot;
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; ( put@@ ties ) .
&quot; the good is that these dre@@ ad nation@@ alists spread , a rather good lesson . &quot;
&quot; now , it is time to justi@@ fy its nation@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; while the action is able to send a strong signal to all the H@@ ass@@ language , the efficiency of this strategy may not stop long . &quot;
&quot; the experience of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ chat have proven that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of shut@@ ters often have a cat@@ tery - and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks will be easily to use a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the Spanish word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at , such as Facebook began to delete his po@@ sts , when he wanted to tell his friends only that the word &apos; Cal@@ ar &apos; is known from the social network : &quot;
&quot; when I was attentive to this new Directive on Facebook , I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to visit the Li@@ ken , post and parts of contents for 24 hours because the post &quot; Facebook Community Standards is not relaxing . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of Po@@ sts of people that have no negative intentions or simply try to show their opinions against the H@@ ass@@ ette radi@@ cal nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed that nothing has to do with H@@ ass@@ language :
post without title of Facebook .
in the post he shared his opinion of what extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have been done before the start of the initiative , for example the Burm@@ ese Internet community to ask advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook likes to have a prosper@@ ous intention , rac@@ ism in Bur@@ ma by their platform , but it does not work . &quot;
such words can be found only even more hat@@ red within the various communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and just b@@ anned as &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; pe@@ sen@@ cur@@ ry &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they were made mistakes , they were not sought to sc@@ rut@@ in@@ ly deleted po@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; if they had only some more respect for the 15 million people who had a great turnover of them , would be great . &quot;
fac@@ ebooks automatic c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship has taken care of a lot of spont@@ ane@@ ously among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now make funny and write the word &apos; Cal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of H@@ ass@@ language to see if their po@@ sts are taken from the network . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook @-@ Po@@ sts , which were not sorry , but nevertheless : &quot;
with permission .
the Burm@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch inheritance to an Indian film .
&quot; just to check if Facebook is removed the post , which contains the word cal@@ ar . &quot;
screen@@ shot is used with permission .
&quot; post the post &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot;
screen@@ shot is used with permission .
&quot; in the last five years , extreme national ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to bro@@ aden their voices and their influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , H@@ ass@@ language is to addition to violence in social networks the violence in My@@ an@@ mar , in addition , especially in the field of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where debate between Muslims and Budd@@ hist@@ s have forced to escape . &quot;
Facebook has been for its failure to cri@@ tici@@ ze the har@@ ass@@ man on his bur@@ ial sides under control .
&quot; but instead of saying that simply the word &apos; Cal@@ ar &apos; , it would have better work , rather on the context than on code of concentrated initiatives , and learned from them . &quot;

the children &apos;s age is illegal in Trin@@ idad and Tob@@ ago now illegal .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the parliament of the country has un@@ anim@@ ously decided to ban this practice , so that the mar@@ ries age now is at 18 . &quot;
&quot; before this change of spouse , some members had hin@@ ge and mus@@ li@@ fied religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 it came to a great public tender . at that time , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mah@@ ar@@ aja , the leader of intercultural religious groups of the country gathered together that the state did not merge the maturity since that , age not the maturity of maturity . &quot;
&quot; this occurred regardless of the fact that Trin@@ idad and Tob@@ ago is a member of the UN Children &apos;s Convention on , the Min@@ ors , for every person under the age of 18 . &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of the children , which were married with 15 already , in Trin@@ idad and Tob@@ ago 2,@@ 8 per cent , and with 18 were 8,@@ 1 per cent . &quot;
&quot; 2011 confirmed the Statistical central office of the country , that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married in 19 . &quot;
&quot; online Peti@@ tion and Social @-@ Media movements , which were con@@ fin@@ ed to create laws for children , followed on the foot and pleas@@ ing themselves of great support . without doubt they continue to bring this outcome . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; an Hind@@ u guide , for example had no concerns , the cri@@ tics of children to say , they should dam@@ n &apos;t take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition was shelter for tensions in this actually un@@ complicated thing , and some point came to whether the opposition would agree to the bill at all . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 , the Leg@@ isl@@ ative Dec@@ ree was decided against children - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , which could be discussed in the Represent@@ atives , where it would be a simple majority to take him to the law . &quot;
now only the President of the country must agree and the law pro@@ claimed the law .
one of the sen@@ ators of the country gave to Facebook an status update to the Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agram again :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the Leg@@ isl@@ ative Dec@@ ree was decided against children &apos;s house with 35 votes for this and nobody decided against them .
&quot; after having decided previously in the Senate , the draft can now be made to law . &quot;
the majority of social media media was enth@@ r@@ alled because the laws have finally been changed to the nur@@ sery .
&quot; Facebook @-@ Member Lov@@ ell Francis , who taught a minist@@ erial office in the Education Ministry , said : &quot;
&quot; it has too much time and un@@ necessary od@@ ede needed to merge the core of the matter , but you know what ? the nur@@ ture is illegal in Trin@@ idad and Tob@@ ago now illegal , and that is nearly every price . &quot;
&quot; while A@@ bel Jackson the opinion was , there have definitely long enough to achieve the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ desp@@ all @-@ Thomas over@@ looked that the day was finally arrived : &quot;
&quot; public Status Update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ eth@@ all@@ - Thomas , which sur@@ es : , , Her@@ pr@@ rag@@ ing News ! &quot;
For@@ ann@@ etz has been decided .
&quot; age - 18 , voices - 35 for this - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belong to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , which spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law may be noted : &quot;

&quot; but a possible h@@ ooks comes in the form of sat Mah@@ ar@@ aja , therefore , the Secretary General of San@@ at@@ an Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hind@@ u organization of the country . &quot;
&quot; before months Mah@@ ar@@ aja announced his intention to do the judi@@ cial steps , should the law be adopted , and it seems to be its promises . &quot;
&quot; during the general state @-@ handed Paris Al ra@@ wi , one author of the law , it may be quite legally binding when Mah@@ ar@@ aja against the law wants to move towards the law , the most social @-@ media user , one would lead to the issue differently . &quot;

&quot; dear Sat , if we , instead of keeping the discussion so general , in a way we could talk instead of the problem , simply targeted to talk about the problem that they may need from big , hard @-@ minded men whom they may need to be ab@@ used , if you are ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you believe that it is not a problem ?
&quot; but whether there is now a judi@@ cial approach against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where children stand in various paragrap@@ hs legal or furthermore the norm continues , although there is laws which they say . &quot;

&quot; by the mirr@@ ors of websites , the Turkish users can look at Wikipedia content . &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ language Wikipedia @-@ site was shown on 18 January 2012 , estimated to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copy@@ rights in the US , internationally . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC BY @-@ SA 3.0 )
&quot; for over a month , Turkey has now been the popular and the Cro@@ w@@ ds@@ ourcing principle based enzy@@ klo@@ p@@ pedia Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; day by day is evident , how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information . &quot;
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series is w@@ inger against the blo@@ cking .
&quot; although many m@@ amb@@ ed internet users are used to use further tools for block@@ ed websites ( a current article by the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third @-@ largest VPN pre@@ valence of the world ) , the most ordinary Wikipedia user do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been seen from Wikipedia , as recently published in a report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society on Harv@@ ard University , find regular block@@ boards of the internet since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;
&quot; according to China , Turkey is the most known country in the world , when it comes to the massive c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform continues to be locked , there are several Mir@@ ror@@ pages ( pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and frequently be updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform all Turkish Wikipedia @-@ pages based on its de@@ centralized Peer @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( so machine computer connections ) which does not base itself on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship difficult . &quot;
the content is in spite of law@@ ful pro@@ hibition .
in a blog post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
&quot; after we have heard the news ( via the blo@@ cking of Wikipedia ) , we put everything in doing snap@@ shots from Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility to read the content on de@@ centralized and distributed way . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to see at least all Wikipedia contents , even if it cannot achieve the website www.@@ wikipedia.org . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is just around screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to handle the sperm . &quot;
&quot; C@@ risti@@ an Con@@ son@@ ni from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a Mir@@ ror@@ side of Wikipedia , as well as the wiki@@ Mirror , an open source project that each one can utili@@ ze at similar Mir@@ ror@@ pages , when in the respective country Wikipedia is locked . &quot;
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices Member and staff at Mozilla in Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
there is no complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mirror . &quot;
one is acc@@ esses to another URL that is not the original one . that what you can see is from Wikipedia .
&quot; in essence , the server runs the request to the right Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey . &quot;
for this is executed by a server which is not in Turkey .

Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he saw around you never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with bad positioned and balanced colors .
the motivated to carry him a camera to wear and try to conqu@@ er the situation .
back then he was a k@@ id .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 years , Sag@@ ar , trying to bring about N@@ ana to the international scene . &quot;
&quot; and his homeland directly next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offering him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that direct attention to Nep@@ tun . &quot;
he was described on Facebook as it helps him the first @-@ class position in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Parks , a World Heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just spent me at home than me suddenly Navar@@ re ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my Father that at the shore of the Rap@@ ti river was a le@@ op@@ ard .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes from the tourist town Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
I immediately ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
&quot; my father had been watching him , and showed me the place on the other river side , where the le@@ op@@ ard was there and I immediately started to cr@@ ush pictures ! ! &quot;
Sag@@ ar seeks a cooperation with the authorities to achieve worldwide recognition for Nep@@ al nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding of it that wild animals are not so fri@@ ght@@ ened as they look .
&quot; and he should know it , because he stood before tig@@ ers already from coun@@ ten@@ ance towards coun@@ ten@@ ance : &quot;
a tiger can not distur@@ b from the opinion of the sheep at bed@@ time ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was at home because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the hard@@ ship appeared . he immediately works , we see ourselves and he l@@ ends me through the S@@ al trees ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar the logo &quot; I click for Conservation ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
&quot; however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als nature and wild is not always easy . &quot;
&quot; he wa@@ ited 22 days long , and was mostly in a tent to make up in the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days lasted until he was able to photo@@ graph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near tourist information . &quot;

&quot; this article was written by Kay@@ on@@ aa@@ z K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a , originally published on Video Volunteers , an award @-@ winning media organisation from India . &quot;
a updated version was published here as part of a content Sharing .
&quot; in many parts of India , we avoid women with the greatest care , the name of their husband or even of older men in the family . &quot;
instead they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mah@@ ar@@ as@@ ht@@ ra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect the husband &apos;s social pressure , as well as the fear of the consequences , they should be miss@@ able to maintain this practice in life . &quot;
&quot; last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condem@@ ned by the Indian state O@@ dish@@ a by a ph@@ al court , condem@@ ned by their family and the vill@@ agers , having addressed a attached relatives by names . &quot;
&quot; the tradition who also call their wives , is also widespread in the name , is also among men widespread . however , they have a lot less access to fear if at all , they should not come into practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mah@@ ar@@ as@@ ht@@ ra , played nine women , including health , and house@@ wives , a unique club with and thus quickly became the main progressive topic of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for them alone where they will discuss the enemies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate and discuss .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs , there is in 13 Indian States , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al that is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and set up for the dis@@ mant@@ ling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ has been working with the help of their video camera at the discovery of practices , such as children &apos;s gifts up to the ex@@ ile of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and guides these clubs . &quot;
it tells about how these clubs have created a secure place for these women and they are simultaneously made at the same time at the bottom of the wall .
&quot; the first video , the Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion , handmade by women who do not call their husband to name . &quot;
&quot; she decided on this subject , because she wanted to open the interview about Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with whom the women can easily identify . &quot;
&quot; the name of her husband are not nois@@ y out to speak , is a bre@@ eze to maintain them all over an extra charge and never in question . &quot;
14 : 00 : 00
this tradition testi@@ fied that a woman is respected her husband and wishes him a long life .
&quot; a woman who don &apos;t hold this , is considered to be depos@@ ited as woman without mor@@ ality . &quot;
the tradition is so deeply root@@ ed that we have never done ourselves up to this discussion .
&quot; at the beginning did Roh@@ ini , who have never called her husband to never called by name at home , how it works . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion of her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
&quot; my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband weig@@ h for long , after the video was at the end . &quot;
&quot; intern@@ ash , my husband , dre@@ amed up to me and said , I sol@@ der him from now on to his name . &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in baggage started Roh@@ ini their first discussion club .
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; &quot; never before . some believed that it would be a good thing , because it was meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; after the video project , the women sought to bring discussion with a exercise in motion . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini bat every participant in the name of her husband with different emotions - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked them , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our husband , but they can call us how they want , meaning that they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it be not equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married since 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of her husband over the lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ he , from the village of Wal@@ he in Mah@@ ar@@ as@@ ht@@ ra , in the married women the name of her husband . &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells :
&quot; a woman was so sh@@ y that they just went away from the whole exercise , but another decided to release the whole an@@ qu@@ itting fru@@ stration against him and his family , bringing it cur@@ sed . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ek@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; in the ad@@ renal@@ in talks about , with an ancient glasses , the women decided that they were really trying at home to name their husband &apos;s name . &quot;
and they kept their word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
&quot; the husband called a woman called Roh@@ ini , and asked what ideas put them in the head : his wife could not stop his name . &quot;
another K@@ lub@@ mit@@ member decided to do it during dinner before the entire family .
&quot; as her mother @-@ in @-@ law she met her , she got fear and said that there was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini supp@@ te , I do it . &quot;
a student of a participant in was less comprehen@@ sible and the situation art@@ ed in violence .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as the wearing of the fasc@@ ist red points on the for@@ ehead , which shows the Eh@@ est@@ atus : &quot;
why only women need to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would bear the fasc@@ ist red spot if he also died . &quot;
he laugh@@ ed only and I heard so that to carry it .
&quot; the other women have not completely heard this , but my , they are now in a better position to choose , even to carry it in some days . &quot;
for many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip on each discussion . &quot;
&quot; normally , we pack lunch and water and go out into the field . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t want to make the women make sure who could hear what they say , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; during the last few months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they dan@@ ces , and talked about things that they had never had thought before . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years now and I also have some things , for example how our identi@@ ties are connected to our husband and never been so honest . &quot;
&quot; it feels good to tell certain things nois@@ y , no matter how small they are occurr@@ ing . &quot;
in a discussion we have talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected to clothing .
some women in the group have carried only Sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most of the thing is okay , but some wanted a sal@@ ary cur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a h@@ ose , wearing ; they did not bapti@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; after a lot of arguments and discussion about the advantages of their own clothes , mor@@ als connected with the Sar@@ is and much more , tast@@ ed Roh@@ ini their own pair of cur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a discussion , so that the women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next , they now decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear je@@ ans and raw ini is certain that they will be able to create it . &quot;
&quot; on the question , whether in the five months they have changed something for their first discussion , confirms the things slowly come into roles : &quot;
we have so far taken little steps so far .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but heard then again to tell the name of her husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , make it still , but only when they are alone , and no other family members are involved . &quot;
only one or two they continue to say the name of her husband ; only one or two women now bear interest in their for@@ ehead on their for@@ ehead .
women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - just like the f@@ ond of more freedom of movement or their own clothes @-@ choice - at the end of a hard to navigate river .
&quot; in order to give each other self confidence , they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explained :
each of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am too .
&quot; but this club , each of us gives us confidence that will change something . &quot;
&quot; and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families , if every woman in the club goes home and told other people about what we talk and what we do . &quot;
we are all sitting in the same boat .

&quot; a new system of kid@@ ney @-@ headed persons for organs , pres@@ um@@ ably for aber@@ ration purposes , likely to stop the police of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambi@@ que . the local government now called a number of operations to life to stop the practition@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month three men in the district Mil@@ k were killed , a few kilometers from the border to Mal@@ awi . &quot;
one of the victims was revealed and a part of the organs have been taken .
two men were arrested and st@@ aged them in the sequence that the organs of sh@@ aman are used in Tanzania and Mal@@ awi .
&quot; I believe the local super@@ sti@@ tions , that the head of a gl@@ aze &apos;s male gold can bring old or wealth , explained the police speaker of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia on the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that consecutive attacks were registered in Moz@@ ambi@@ que men in Moz@@ ambi@@ que .
another group that is the aim of excit@@ ements for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes is people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to study that the UN in the South African country has led to a mission to investigate these practition@@ ers .
&quot; persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of the southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring land of Tanzania where the government has developed campaigns to fight this super@@ sti@@ tions and pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;

&quot; the persecution and ass@@ ass@@ ination of gl@@ amor@@ ous individuals , for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ ru@@ mb@@ ala , the province of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia , has given cultural moti@@ ves , and is considered by the traditional sh@@ aman in regard to the police of the Republic of Moz@@ ambi@@ que ( PR@@ M ) which means that a belief existed , according to the victims of the head , the rich@@ es . &quot;
in the last days three men have been killed with hair loss problems in this part of the country .

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia which was probably made just recently .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the case of the un@@ realized Chinese Dis@@ pres@@ idents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has drawn attention in the international community , after being announced at the end of June that he has been delivered to hospital because of liver cancer . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 Li@@ u was condem@@ ned to eleven years of prison for &quot; Subversion , &quot; after the draft of the Charter 08 , a Mani@@ fes@@ to , which promp@@ ted democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded for his work in 2010 with the No@@ bel Prize .
&quot; the State Department in China has been called Li@@ us case as &quot; an internal matter &quot; and a spok@@ es@@ man told him , he said it as &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless China continues to receive views of the international community , the No@@ bel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , Di@@ alli@@ in Li@@ u X@@ ia , release or allow him a treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely covered . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
united nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hus@@ sein , the organiz@@ er of the United Nations for human rights , met the end of June Chinese officials in order to discuss the fall of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , an speaker expressed it , however , whether the United Nations should put pressure in order to make Li@@ u abroad a treatment . &quot;
Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸@@ r@@ ge Br@@ ende have den@@ ied questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway was awarded the Sto@@ cks , after the No@@ bel Prize 2010 at Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government has had to do nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations was continued until December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume the Sal@@ urn went back to China since the exports have been block@@ ed since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; after having been spread the message that Li@@ u had seriously believed , the no@@ ble Kom@@ it@@ ee brought his hope for an un@@ condition@@ ally release to express and lu@@ d Li@@ u , to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to its inc@@ eption , he was not able to accept his prize . &quot;
during the ceremony was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on 6 July the European Parliament adopted a decision to liber@@ ate Li@@ u and his wife immediately from the landlord and allow him to seek medical support , where he wants . &quot;
&quot; the peak of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mog@@ her@@ ini , called for China also to release Li@@ us on how they live in an explanation on 30 June . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we are expecting to elev@@ ate China all restrictions to Mr. Li@@ us wife as well as family members . &quot;
&quot; they shall meet all the visits and receive , who wish them , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
USA
&quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad shared with that the Americans &quot; &quot; he wish him that he has the opportunity for the treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; a speaker of U.S. Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , gave the news agency AF@@ P on 27 June , not only release Li@@ u , but also release his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her home rest . &quot;
&quot; the so@@ lic@@ itation of the US message moved to a angry answer from China , with the utter@@ ance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , that &quot; no country has the right to make themselves and un@@ answered remarks about Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared with that China should offer the couple of following :
&quot; protection and freedom such as free speech and access to the medical treatment of its choice , which they are entitled according to Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , J@@ eff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to push Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; I urge China to release the No@@ bel lau@@ re@@ ates # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o unconditional , so that he can go into a proper medical treatment . http : / / bit.ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o &quot;
Germany
&quot; the German government speakers Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin hope that Li@@ u gets all the medical support that he needs and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese president Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 Summit in Hamburg .
&quot; previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing of the news agency Reu@@ ters that China had great concerns whether the vor@@ tex could be over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by Li@@ u the visit in Hamburg . &quot;
Canada
&quot; on 28 June , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China said to provide adequate medical care and to give him the opportunity to worry about his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ us attorney created AF@@ P previously , that Li@@ us wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , him every day could be monitored , but the police are not allowed to monitor the room in hospital and that it Li@@ u is not allowed to speak with someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells about :
&quot; Canada calls for China to preserve its international human rights violations , including freedom of expression , to preserve and release them for the exercise of these rights . &quot;
Poland
France &apos;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs called for China in an explanation on 29 June to Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , all treatments receives , regardless of where , needed . furthermore , his wife and his family have to have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the new@@ born France Info already reported that the French government Li@@ u would be welcome in the country , the State Department announced that there will no further information come out whether France will ultimately be absor@@ bed . &quot;
Taiwan
&quot; the Council of Govern@@ mental matters in Taiwan has called for China on 27 June to Li@@ u and to show a greater tolerance against those who challenge peaceful reforms and democratic development . &quot;
&quot; the tai@@ w@@ anese legisl@@ ator at Yu Me@@ i @-@ n@@ u by the Reg@@ ul@@ ing Democratic Pro@@ gress Party , China also called on to allow the sick int@@ ellec@@ tu@@ als to be treated in Taiwan . &quot;
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leaders in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed themselves to Li@@ u on 28 June at Li@@ u , and gave him that many him have asked to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my faith that the initiatives that he took and for which he was strict to have a harmon@@ ic , stable and prosper@@ ous China had contributed to a peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I felt personally moved and also encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese int@@ ellec@@ tu@@ als , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or Land ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may appear stup@@ id since Singapore is recognized on an independent state as an independent state .
but according to the judi@@ cial minister K. Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am should be considered in Singapore as a city .
this remark has trig@@ gered a debate in the blo@@ go@@ sphere .
&quot; during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York the Minister , that many people cri@@ tici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore , because it was compared to Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he emphas@@ ise that Singapore as a city should be considered .
... no one has asked questions about whether new York is a democracy ...
&quot; this is , whereby most people make a mistake . &quot;
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are no country .
&quot; the blog of Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io acc@@ used the judi@@ cial minister , &quot; &quot; the logic to rot@@ ate &quot; to defend the existing autor@@ it@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , according to all our efforts and sacrific@@ es , this valuable land you can say that we were ultimately not a country . &quot;
&quot; it became so vul@@ gar , it had the res@@ ort@@ ing of a flight before the answer@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , eat country it is then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons were not very no@@ ble : he def@@ ended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , given the contrary he appeared un@@ wei@@ rd und@@ em@@ ocratic . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , he has def@@ ended the idea that Singapore has to be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , alike , which will permanently be guided by a party . &quot;
these cities are democrati@@ cally .
&quot; once one reaches the core point of the theme , the good old cor@@ ders reached by the author@@ it@@ arian fe@@ eders who give pre@@ ach democr@@ ats , leaving the twi@@ sted logic , as it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the end the last week of Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am had given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our Judi@@ ci@@ ative , our political system truly non @-@ answers . &quot;
corresponding questions comm@@ its with non @-@ responses .
&quot; Rachel Z@@ eng calls Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am to clear his opinion , since it did not understand this conclusion . &quot;
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; when Singapore is not a country , but a city is , thus to what land belongs to our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I understand nothing . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our wer@@ ter K Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am would take the effort to clari@@ fy this point , provided that he was highly paid to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; on the blog published his comment , he pointed out the reviews on the reviews that one should start to read the whole fellow @-@ line of the conference to better understand the context of the statements of Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am , according to which Singapore is a city and no land . &quot;
read the co @-@ ordin@@ ance .
&quot; when he said that Singapore is more an &quot; city &quot; &quot; be considered a country , &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore is so un@@ complicated , even if we are happy with free and fair elections . &quot;
in Singapore with cities in the U.S. ( and how many of these cities saw decades @-@ tel@@ ev@@ ing a party ? ) .
&quot; as he said , Singapore &quot; be no country , &quot; he obviously has not meant to be in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am , which makes a leader of an inv@@ ented generation , such pol@@ emic statement . &quot;
&quot; I am told about what the judi@@ cial minister of Singapore has said , so much ... &quot;
at least I did with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de what I expect - if I agree with them or not , but that is another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am , Member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes that he is really aware of what he def@@ ended . &quot;
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review dis@@ covers the weak points of Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ ams :
&quot; did Mr. Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am &quot; &quot; ben@@ ug@@ ly a mistake , or was it a fre@@ er speaker ? &quot;
&quot; when Singapore is not a country , we are only regarded as independent and sover@@ eign state ? &quot;
if not , in what country do the sover@@ eign rights of the city of Singapore back ? &quot;
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city . &quot;
&quot; as he plays an important role within the government of government , the statements by Mr. Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am is serious . &quot;
why do they afford to defend their military service but do not defend their city but not their country ?
whom must our prime minister b@@ ills ?
what is the value of our pink personnel ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; that the magazine Jour@@ ney of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and has always been a city : &quot;
I have not told what I said ...
this set seems to have many more an@@ tig@@ ers ...
nobody has ever told that Singapore has a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear any statements such as &quot; the defense of the country above all , etc . , but that &apos;s not quite true . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the my@@ th of the &quot; cute channel &quot;
the Canadian NE@@ D Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked about short his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect on your home or home country ?
&quot; your answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series , with rum@@ ours on certain parts of the world , and a different fac@@ et will be shown . &quot;
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ is Thom@@ p@@ son , Red@@ ak@@ te@@ ur for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
&quot; the question which is put me in Japan on most , is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , sorry I am sorry , I then I come from Canada . &quot; I &apos;ve come from Canada . since 1994 I went back and again in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is regarded as polite , interest in his conversation , by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; then usually the default response follows : &quot; Oh , Rock@@ y Mountains , hockey , nature . &quot; many can@@ adi@@ er cook perhaps intern@@ ally before rage when they are held for Americans , but don &apos;t distur@@ b it . &quot;
&quot; for someone who does not know , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us can@@ adi@@ er from Americans . &quot;
&quot; this is one of the reasons why so many can@@ adi@@ ans bring an can@@ adi@@ c flag on their back@@ pack , when they travel . &quot;
all love can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans on the other ... .
&quot; so it was already when I began to travel over 20 years ago - before Donald Tru@@ mp , in front of the mar@@ ry in Iraq and the 11th of September . &quot;
Kan@@ adi@@ ans have always used small map@@ le sheets on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighb@@ ors .
we have a free health care !
with us there are no weapons !
gender @-@ sex@@ ually marri@@ ages are already legal in Canada for 2005 !
&quot; all seem to think , Canada is so great . &quot;
we are polite .
&quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Canada is also regarded as the toler@@ ant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not like these types just south of the border .
we Canadian are nice .
I hate that .
&quot; first , I have many American friends that I ad@@ mi@@ red . &quot;
&quot; it would not make me anything , if one would change me for example with Johnny from Dallas . &quot;
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
there are also some problems with the stamp . &quot;
&quot; first : &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; to be referred to as &quot; &quot; nice &quot; , &quot; said to be as the ben@@ ign , gentle , but trag@@ ically un@@ significant figure NE@@ D Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has its own can@@ adi@@ c Doppel@@ gÃ¤nger ) . &quot;
&quot; when Canada really would be a nation of people like NE@@ D Flan@@ ders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; no personality has . &quot;
&quot; there is no corners and ed@@ ges , nothing , where you can encounter . &quot;
harm@@ less it is to be un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting and no attention to earn .
&quot; this may be something good if one wants to remain un@@ noticed in the background , fer@@ r@@ b from the things that happen around one . &quot;
&quot; I would even have to go , to say that the desire , free and alone , a captain of the can@@ adi@@ er is . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; what out@@ si@@ ders as &quot; &quot; nice &quot; , &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot;
can@@ adian don &apos;t talk about the fence with the neighb@@ ors .
&quot; we lack the warm , open kindness , which I am working with my American friends . &quot;
&quot; luck@@ ily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , J@@ ustin Tru@@ de@@ au the stage to show that can@@ adian more than just &apos; nice . &quot;
musical video of a pop @-@ band par@@ o@@ ded Thail@@ ands
&quot; one in Thailand &apos;s famous pop band has released a music video that the Jun@@ ta par@@ o@@ des , which will re@@ produce power in 2014 , and despite their promises , the civilian government continues to reg@@ ain the country . &quot;
&quot; the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det girl ) the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man , which tells him his girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; although the music video is not expressly contra@@ dic@@ ted to the ongoing military rule of the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was dealt with by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video to the song was a huge success .
&quot; within the first three days , it was divided on Facebook high @-@ yellow video 1.@@ 254 times and received 8.@@ 800 Li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; The Dic@@ ator &quot; was block@@ ed in Thailand after a group of acti@@ vi@@ sts the public to look at this video . &quot;
the video can interpre@@ t as a creative and entertaining introduction to the Thai policy as it beh@@ aves with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
&quot; look at once these recordings of the video , which refer to some of the political issues that Thailand have been pursued in the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; 44 Rules of girls &quot; refer to the dra@@ in section of 44 of the provis@@ ional Constitution , which con@@ stitut@@ ed the rul@@ er of the He@@ ader absolute decision making over important national subjects . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change Your attitude &quot; refers to the &quot; inclusion &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , acti@@ vi@@ sts , politicians and other people who are regarded by the Jun@@ ta as a cri@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer criminal criminal , whose v@@ ague and clear rules are often used by the authorities to assume the acti@@ vi@@ sts and other cri@@ tics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit has been established in the army to super@@ vis@@ e the online content and individuals who have thrown before , the mon@@ archy is persec@@ uted , criminal prosec@@ uted . &quot;
Thailand sets a stri@@ kes against &quot; L@@ esis Maj@@ est &quot; ( maj@@ esty ) by .
the war was launched on 20 May 2014 .
two days later it came to a Putin &apos;s army .
&quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to be prosec@@ uted , its decision is expensive U @-@ boats , although security experts they war@@ ned that the purchase is un@@ necessary and a waste of tax hav@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; in the video is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery date , before you bring them into an inter@@ ni@@ p@@ ation camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are sitting in prison , because they suppos@@ edly have caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and on the Internet are being led by the mon@@ archy , they should ob@@ li@@ fy the mon@@ archy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the Te@@ aser of the song showed the band members of the band who has been used to the Salu@@ t from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em &quot; im@@ iti@@ vely , who was already used by angels during the protests in 2014 . &quot;

the post @-@ war society re@@ pris@@ ed only very slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ ism , especially in the district T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; now over 20 years have passed since the Georgi@@ an @-@ ab@@ ch@@ astic War was officially completed , but his sc@@ ars are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern District in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show mark@@ er pictures .
&quot; villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ ht@@ a , Poly@@ ana and Khar@@ chil@@ ava are located in the carbon @-@ basin . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Rus@@ sians , Gre@@ eks , Sh@@ em@@ as , Georgi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians were living and worked for so@@ g@@ ings in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today most of Rus@@ sians live in the area today .
such settlements are also called Gei@@ ster@@ stÃ¤d@@ t .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here today , there are only a few hundred people in these spirits cities . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district 16@@ ,000 people have risen almost over a decade . &quot;
1989 some 43.@@ 000 people lived in this district .

&quot; the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 60@@ s , called Chr@@ usch@@ ek @-@ kow@@ y , stand symbo@@ lic@@ ally for the decline and dev@@ ast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are falling and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a local older man .
he begins a conversation and it is hard to end this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
it is still unique . &quot;
in front of the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were communal centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , all of the community . &quot;
&quot; now , there is only paved road with f@@ aded glory buildings . &quot;
&quot; people who once lived in this place and their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union , have left the district . &quot;
in the Gei@@ ster@@ town D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha live about fifty inhabitants .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a in the other villages it looks similar .
&quot; the Chron@@ ic@@ ka , which are still offered one or two families , can be seen at balconies , where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in hand , they turn right away . &quot;
&quot; our mother has b@@ anned us that we photograph@@ ed ourselves , &quot; says one of the girl . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she has simply b@@ anned us that is all . &quot;
the girl fle@@ eting her girlfriend somewhat and suddenly left the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mountain structure called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence ( cultivation of scenic products for the own need ) such as cattle @-@ breeding , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable growing . &quot;
it is difficult to get over the l@@ aps .
the District management provides free candles in the winter for free candles and bread to the villages .

&quot; about ten years ago , an older woman moved to Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ alya as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to j@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha . &quot;
&quot; despite her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave from Ab@@ ch@@ asi@@ ans to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ dom@@ ini@@ ties , &quot; she tells them . &quot;
Gal@@ ina wants to accept no financial aid from her daughter and ad@@ j@@ ails that they are instead supported their young grand@@ son .
Gal@@ inas monthly r@@ ents are just nine dollars .

when holidays are , we visit us . &quot;

&quot; while she tells her story , a younger neighb@@ our appears on the balcony . &quot;

&quot; we have no fear of the dark street or the few people .
one can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it is more likely to do with pl@@ unge . &quot;
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right .
I remember every day how the city and the war were once .
&quot; as our conversation , the end is circum@@ cis@@ ed , separ@@ ates a little boy at us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destruc@@ tive building and hidden .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy .
&quot; he plays with the ball , which then down the hill . &quot;
a group children now moves the ball .
&quot; while they are running , some of them shed some of them on the falling building . &quot;
these ruins are part of their childhood who care for in@@ consistency in their lives .

it is a very simple hotel close to the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - J@@ ow@@ ri@@ gen Mex@@ ik@@ an@@ erin , a small woman with a cor@@ al @-@ pink bril@@ liance and gold colored ear@@ rings in Ted@@ dy@@ bears . &quot;
&quot; it is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born there in tap@@ ach@@ ula , and she grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name of Mama Africa . &quot;
&quot; this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ ti@@ aner , who are on the passage . &quot;
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for about 2,50 Euro the night sleep in simple rooms , with cold , cru@@ m@@ bling walls and beds of metal . &quot;
in the court there is a par@@ rots in a c@@ age .
there is no sign@@ post to the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and ha@@ iti@@ an immig@@ rants here .
&quot; sometimes , Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez comes the people in full mini@@ bus and from the upper part of the coast to call them : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? .
&quot; at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept outside on cart@@ ons . &quot;
it does not want to reject anyone .
she also helps them and brings her to hospital when they are sick them that they cannot pay them with a bal@@ m away from the long journey ex@@ haus@@ tive shots .
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , is a short time ago . &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa a reasonable nickname for Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a j@@ og@@ ay@@ bart ) posi@@ ated with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
foto : Amy Br@@ acken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; yes , &quot; he answered with a smile . &quot; I really feel that there is too her , as African women are very nice women . &quot;
very lov@@ ingly .
she has the cordi@@ ality of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
&quot; Sebasti@@ ao travelled with his sister , the hopes to get to Boston to get there her husband and the three children . &quot;
&quot; they have lived in Brazil , however , it is for some Afri@@ cans , which are on the way to the United States , normally make a first stop in South America and then drag the north to the north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard from other musicians from Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a known name on the track , &quot; &quot; Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells that Hai@@ ti@@ aner and the Afri@@ cans often travel together the route and that the Afri@@ cans are already talking to W@@ hat@@ s@@ App from Ms Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
&quot; as many of his way , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the football world championship . &quot;
&quot; when the Bra@@ zi@@ lian economy was weak@@ ened , he has started his journey into the United States . &quot;
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he s@@ ells SI@@ M cards to save the necessary money to buy the B@@ usti@@ cket after Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will have in the future with Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go again , &quot; he answered smiling . &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells you their guests often send text messages if they have continued to greet them or to report it over the course of their journey .
it explains that their Christian faith of the drive of their work is .
&quot; she don &apos;t know much about Africa , but their guests have brought her to prepare chicken as in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps very well known , but it is not the only spar@@ ken hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ cian .
this winter started Valen@@ cian of Valen@@ cian and his family migrants in their small house .
he is polic@@ eman and has found that the hor@@ semen to be sold to numerous African immig@@ rants .
&quot; he began to help them to get a reasonable price , then he has offered them his house for a dollar spent the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ ti@@ aner . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on blan@@ kets on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a kitchenette outside . &quot;
Valen@@ cian told that he knows what the guests make through .
&quot; I lived in the United States , he tells . &quot; &quot; I experienced what they experience . &quot;
I have crossed the border on the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others will not help . this is the reason why I give them my support .
&quot; after he lived in three years , he was elected as a raid on his work place from the United States . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants who travels through tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their houses for them . &quot;
&quot; JosÃ© Antonio Cord@@ ova Mel@@ Ã©@@ n@@ de@@ z tells me that he was flown out in Honduras with his wife and three children , who wanted to have the money from him , without having a plan . &quot;
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and an un@@ familiar , a single @-@ known , has offered it their roof . &quot;
&quot; some months later the family lives still there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa is all back full of guests .
in the courses the trav@@ eller are quiet their teleph@@ ones .
&quot; a mini@@ bus has arrived today and brought 20 new guests , a large majority of Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that their house is full , but it is also no@@ stal@@ g@@ ically because of those who have gone away . &quot;
like a st@@ ol@@ ze grand@@ mother att@@ ed them in their album with numerous photos .
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair fle@@ ets which you made a customer in , some photos of their grand@@ children and many travellers more , boy and Alte . &quot;
they are sad while they imagine it to me shortly .
&quot; Y@@ a se fu@@ eron , &quot; repeat them every time . &quot; &quot; you have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang citizens are forced to install on their hand &apos;s a surveillance app .
&quot; an check @-@ point for personal communication equipment , in X@@ inj@@ ang of Twitter @-@ Users . &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , ethnic minorities region in the West China , are forced to install a spy@@ ware on their hand@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; on 10 July the mobile users were received in the Ti@@ an@@ shan District of the city of Uru@@ m@@ qi , in which it indicates the District government , a surveillance government called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the notification , it is said that the app is to obtain access to terror@@ ist information . &quot;
but the authorities will also use the App for more than the fight against terrorism .
&quot; according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonom@@ ous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture , because it , shortly after she had installed the app , messages with a private We@@ chat group . &quot;
&quot; in the Communication of the police that the app will determine the sources and distribution paths of terrorists and follow , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; , including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ont website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective performance with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ ash@@ u Tele@@ com . &quot;
&quot; the main function is the block@@ age porno@@ graphic websites , from online sc@@ am , Troj@@ an and ph@@ ishing sites to make users attention to how much time they spend online , and to control our own home network . &quot;
this app with the filter for min@@ ors should help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can naturally be used in many ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; &quot; Remote &quot; &quot; actors could be able to manip@@ ulate or ste@@ al the home network of a person or to ste@@ al it . &quot;
this introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
&quot; while announcements over digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China can mostly concentrate on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often d@@ amp@@ er for those who live in remote , un@@ authorised ethnic minorities , such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in the conflict areas , the authorities do often arrange extreme ens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ in@@ em@@ ous Internet shut@@ down . &quot;
&quot; this published on Twitter @-@ out@@ let &apos;s images from the China &quot; &quot; images from both China &quot; &quot; ( both of our p@@ endant ) , showed photos of a Ch@@ eckpoint in the polic@@ emen , showed photos of a Ch@@ eckpoint , in the police officers , whether they had installed the surveillance app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ano make sure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang App .
a mobile notification slow@@ ing that people install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you want to be discovered at a ch@@ eckpoint with a device without these software , they could be worn up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a backl@@ ash for technological development .
&quot; they have forced the people to use equipment , which are intended for older people to use . &quot;
this is a form of cap@@ tivity by means of rest technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from both China &quot; ( in @-@ stage ) : there &apos;s also a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang @-@ Description , from the highlighted that the software can lift the identification requirement of a Windows operating system and thereby receives unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot;
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang &apos;s computer and hand@@ ys in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang for electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may possibly have a reaction to the instructions of the city Party to minim@@ ise the dis@@ semination of illegal contents .
&quot; all government representatives , authorities and the party associated institutions including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of Cyber@@ security office when running their computer and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a later report by Freedom House , a US American human rights organization , mentioned these new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Uru@@ m@@ qi , a regulation with the assignment to all residents and entrepreneurs , until 1st August their &quot; personal ID @-@ cards , hand@@ ys , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously any &quot; terror@@ ist videos &quot; &quot; identify and consu@@ me this action however , the personality rights of Uru@@ m@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole range of other possible contracts , including such that refers to peaceful religious or political communications . &quot;
sleep and death , part 1 : everything moves to death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie Bar@@ kli@@ more ( CC BY 2.0 ) .
&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep and death &quot; , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane presents his experiences in an Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world you look at and stell@@ ar that you &apos;re very alone on a place where everything has gone . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually released , and un@@ v@@ eil@@ ed a truth which is clearly recogni@@ z@@ able , both inside and outside . &quot;
one which makes her name all honour .
one who has turned into a list of feelings and expres@@ sing expres@@ sing the no met@@ ap@@ her@@ n .
&quot; but when you get back the reality and you look behind the scenes , the beautiful scenes and the performers - turn the characters in essence of meat and blood , and everything scre@@ eds after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubt can be solved in R@@ auch , and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth is on the axis of the dis@@ infection . you will clear that you are caught here between the walls , who have your parents , and before them thy grand@@ parents , stone around stone . &quot;
&quot; they have arrested me and my Father three times , but that is not yet so I am not so that I &quot; mean &quot; my lesson &quot; , &quot; as the boss of the Security Service , it form@@ uli@@ zed with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
&quot; he introduced his power over us , considering even the simpl@@ est concepts destroyed , which we knew . &quot;
five young people were ger@@ ated during a peaceful protests like weed out of the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it stret@@ ched so that the town the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; was dis@@ connected .
&quot; all districts of the districts , just my own not . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was silent , ra@@ iny , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city which is up to the ar@@ ter@@ ies with state security organisms and their comp@@ liments . &quot;
in the third night things had a bit so@@ othing after the power supply in the quarter .
I broke the still@@ ness by taking several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; of my house @-@ roof .
I heard my voice through the silence res@@ ists .
a few minutes later some of my friends were bra@@ ve enough to find together .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends f@@ ills me on ; we burned us a pra@@ ised picture that filled my expectations full and filled . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you are aware that you are fre@@ ed the spirit from the lamp , but it is simply not interested in the Ger@@ ing@@ est . &quot;
&quot; I received a call of my father : &quot; &quot; makes you ready , we meet us at the military security building . &quot;
he put on .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can hold down - nothing can give you your voice , after you have done you all the way up to the office of the Security Council . &quot;
I came there .
&quot; the rul@@ est Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now also . &quot;
&quot; the rul@@ er Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to speak : &quot; let also hear me , as you &apos;re going to cry , or you are only bra@@ ve enough to cry , if we are not close to . &quot;
his h@@ asser@@ ted eyes pic@@ tured on me .
&quot; and you make you genuine what to look into the eyes , and not on the ground ! &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building . &quot;
perhaps it was on my cake ; perhaps on the revolution .
&quot; I was so sure of my thing as I said , &quot; I didn &apos;t think that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; and I think I have never heard you to look into the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the short@@ est entertainment that could have such fat@@ al consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; if it is in single , and his father is equal to it . &quot;
&quot; his father is equal to this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bases of this cur@@ se proposition is up to me today in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; , &quot; a se@@ ductive torture , which I was subj@@ ected to a month . &quot;
I beh@@ ave the farm .
in the first office I let everything go back with me .
then again through the court and into the second office that leads through a gear to the single cells .
I sent me all the details exactly before I enter the room .
&quot; otherwise than else , they have probably dealt a larger cell this time . &quot;
&quot; I have to share it with only one more prisoners , and may immediately put me immediately without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes , who felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I have access to an old &apos; proven communication method : with the f@@ ist to beat the wall . &quot;
I learned that my tick @-@ man a &quot; Er@@ sth@@ Ã¤@@ del@@ ling was . &quot;
after a long time he answered me finally .
&quot; apparently there was none of the surrounding cells a decent man middle age , who sees me similar and &quot; &quot; doctor &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in perfect darkness leave me no mark@@ edly face scene , and doctors are not here : we are all only numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice sounds similar to my sounds ? &quot;
all responses are net@@ worked out of his existence .
perhaps he has moved into one of the great cells .
perhaps he will immediately be heard .
&quot; the investig@@ ator had in@@ sured me , they would release him when I stay . &quot;
tweet
&quot; I would like to have a bird @-@ eu@@ vre to distribute all of these cro@@ ps , which lab@@ elled themselves to the fruits in the garden of my head . &quot;
from the distance I hear them still &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; it must be at about 10 a.m. in the evening ; always at this time , the scre@@ ams , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black was the colour of the ver@@ sus , until I saw the yellow light that set us the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( e.g. : &quot; Don@@ ner &quot; , reference to 13th S@@ ure of the Quran ) . &quot;
they are here to be heard .
&quot; this was the secret of the secret : to protect the state security in front of us and prevent terrorists in us , they talk in al@@ a@@ esthetic di@@ al@@ ect - thus they played their con@@ fes@@ om@@ inations of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , which is not a country ; it is a cur@@ se that they call co@@ existence to transform the cri@@ minals in their cl@@ an into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I enter the audi@@ ences and tre@@ ats to Abu I@@ mad , a slim and enlight@@ ened man ; at least he comes me so before . &quot;
&quot; he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the facial fl@@ asks , &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life as you start this day and to prot@@ ru@@ ding demonstrations , which will soon be an end soon . &quot;
I did not rep@@ lied .
&quot; I used it to me , not to answer . &quot;
&quot; I really cannot say exactly , when insul@@ ts and blow@@ s have become a friendly conversation for me to an ordinary communication of communication . &quot;
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me said , that I had to be re@@ conc@@ ile , to be pun@@ ished , although I had nothing to earn this pun@@ ishment . &quot;
in pun@@ ishment in all its diversity .
his command is to rip me as much meat as possible from the body .
&quot; he calls the loving &quot; &quot; Gest@@ ure &quot; . &quot; &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube that probably comes from the clo@@ ak .
your hat@@ s dre@@ amed of your cry .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure you with him and you cannot stop your writing . &quot;
&quot; my mess@@ enger fell to him not enough , why she inter@@ change@@ able the tube through a cable . &quot;
at my first time I asked myself whether the investig@@ ators had worked earlier than g@@ arb@@ age coll@@ ector or whether they belong to the normal working class .
&quot; they had four cables in@@ bound to present ourselves the , from their view , great discovery of a huge cab@@ els . &quot;
within one hour there are rare three of them while I was still in the row .
&quot; I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , why I list@@ ened to write . &quot;
the h@@ ook not@@ ed the cooling and found no vessels in all because he was considered to become an electric slide show .
&quot; flow through my entire body , enough to supply my entire neighborhood . &quot;
&quot; my semi @-@ snack body , the stret@@ ched on the ground was the perfect rap@@ tor . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness dis@@ appears and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided to met his duty for this night .
this must have been so much of midnight .
I decided to put me back again ; let us say that was my only option .
some hours passed away to me like minutes .
then the call for dawn .
&quot; the door opens and the morning meets the space &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; I set out with the voice of one ex@@ haus@@ tive young : &quot; my Lord , my Father must be f@@ ear@@ ful worried . &quot;
&quot; be silent and away you , you will be missed . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always left me forever .
where do they lead to me ? !
the j@@ ord@@ an Rap@@ per Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talked about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance . &quot;
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ cht a cigar@@ ette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was recorded by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sp@@ ends the bulk of his time in time ; once he pointed out to his screen , time to his computer , and back to his couch . &quot;
&quot; but what can be left , a cigar@@ ette between his fingers or his with nic@@ ot@@ ine be@@ ad@@ eck@@ ed lips . &quot;
&quot; he lives in the upper floor of his family house , which has been forced to them in 1967 ; in whom Israel had to forced his occupation of the West Bank and fle@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family to fle@@ e from their village in Palestine in which they had lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( about : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for now six years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is a passionate majority confront@@ ed by the conserv@@ ative majority , and their proven opinions on gender rollers , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; with his music , often relate to topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , but also calls the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues are not only possible in his hom@@ et@@ own Am@@ man relevance , but also in cities which range from Dam@@ asc@@ us in Syria to fully after San@@ aa in Y@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; with its 25 years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees itself as a man who is not restricted in his mind through limits and he may feel according to their own statement by people who suffer the dev@@ ast@@ ating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , the Y@@ emen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
even if he did not open it openly against the US American foreign policy .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b looks his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b believes that its sympathy for those who are trying to survive in war areas , ir@@ gen@@ ed with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees was born - so he was born , even if he was born in Jordan , and has never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I do not think of my own living conditions so , &quot; st@@ resses H@@ d@@ ai@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , while in water sol@@ dered nes@@ cafÃ© in two cups ; it is the holy month of Ram@@ ad@@ an ; in that time it is intended for Muslims , from sunrise until sunset . &quot;
the j@@ ord@@ an law also predic@@ ted that the public consumption of food during the Ram@@ ad@@ an illegal .
&quot; obviously , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand has a cup of coffee at a sen@@ ess hot j@@ unt@@ ag little with prot@@ est against Islam . &quot;
generally speaking the s@@ akes are hot coffee and the vibrations of the K@@ ent cigar@@ ette in the nose primarily of freedom .
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially when you thro@@ ws a look into the neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one avo@@ ids easy to do basic things - how to drink the public during the Ram@@ ad@@ an water - in order to land not in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Ministry of Jord@@ ani@@ ens has said a performance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila . already for the second time . &quot;
some parliament@@ arians to support the Islamic nu@@ cle@@ ans@@ ing Front - ar@@ gu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual front s@@ ang@@ ers Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , the cultural and traditional standards of the country contra@@ dic@@ tory and the main reason for the concert . &quot;
&quot; the Euro MPs and former Pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ cher@@ in the Islamic coalition D@@ IMA Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N , that the concert &quot; straight &quot; was cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the S@@ ang@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; many claim also , the commitment of the band in matters like the Arab@@ ian spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world be more dangerous activ@@ ism that represents the proven legi@@ timacy of the authorized legi@@ timacy of the whole region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , m@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila the j@@ ord@@ an people as &quot; &quot; progressive suppor@@ ters of human rights &quot; &quot; who continue to employ themselves &quot; for an intellectual and cultural plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement is likely to be likely not simply sei@@ zed rh@@ et@@ oric , but actually a clear determining reality in Jordan , which occurs in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs work clearly . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b traditional sex@@ ch@@ tern@@ al men to Lei@@ be , looking for his vision of the fate of Arabic women to educ@@ ate sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the sk@@ elet@@ on of an obviously Dutch , un@@ familiar woman , whose arms and legs are up to the corners of the canvas . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red lake ; maybe the blood of the countless women who lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust them . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years in Jordan , the number of &apos; honor@@ ary &apos; were put in Jordan - the in@@ official outside . &quot;
&quot; Human Rights Watch , the number of re@@ mor@@ ale in 2016 reached their peak ; however , the institutional infrastructure is missing to support the women who tried victims of mur@@ ders or domestic violence to ensure appropriate manner . &quot;
&quot; according to a law on the Crime , women , who are exposed to the danger of internal families in prison , &quot; and for their release is often a long @-@ term bureau@@ crati@@ c effort and the guarantee from the family , that the woman is nothing to happen . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs music is pleased to become great popularity and is known for it , also not against subjects back in his country long as a tab@@ u g@@ old . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b den@@ ied that his work is politically , however , however , that he is his music that is full of explicit reference to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , do not separate from politics . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; I have entered politics , &quot; says he says . &quot;
&quot; in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack . &quot;
&quot; in &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; and in &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; is the focus on poverty . &quot;
&quot; the list of the songs , which are politically politically , can be continued . &quot;
in March 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated :
&quot; you are free , and any other is it too . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market , on which one can get in his words , what you want &quot; - be it faith or non@@ sense , het@@ ero@@ - or hom@@ osexu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; he noticed that hardly any one speaks in Jordan on the rights of gay and lesbian , and that comments on equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals are still in high c@@ ens@@ ored in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b led an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an Onlin@@ e@@ Programme Ro@@ ya to remember that his comments was turned out of the context , fil@@ med and his opinion . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube it was uploaded to them without cuts , but was only a be@@ aten version , &quot; says he says . &quot;
today H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is open for the arab@@ ic LGB@@ T@@ Q + -@@ Community and represents the opinion that intoler@@ ance does not cope with hom@@ osexu@@ als not to Islam .
&quot; he mentioned Abu Nu@@ what , a po@@ et of the eighth century , which still has remained in memory thanks to his hom@@ o@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asked : if Abu Nu@@ what , who later work on behalf of the cali@@ bre , in the eighth century was open to hom@@ osexu@@ ality , why can Jord@@ an@@ son not ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
in the H@@ ash@@ emi@@ tic Kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are brought to silence .
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the j@@ ord@@ an news service gave several former government members and members of the teacher &apos;s decision , with the reason , they could have expressed themselves out on comments in social media , which coinci@@ de with the deep in the country of pro@@ claimed corruption . &quot;
&quot; in view of what is the concert H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs , that is only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to achieve a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan . &quot;
&quot; for him progress is a continuous gain and take @-@ time Jordan , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila now has given a performance , but the path of progress - so it looks H@@ d@@ ai@@ b - is sure that these changes will take place from day to day in the heart of the j@@ ord@@ an society . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , like millions of other Arab@@ s , even , from an Arab world without interventions from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he did not toler@@ ate his work until Bag@@ hd@@ ad , Jerusalem and Dam@@ asc@@ us , but also of it , to experience . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region with the help of music , art and literature of genuine and basic openness of approxim@@ ate - and not by bom@@ bs , streams and on artificial kind of democratic democr@@ acies . at least hopes that . &quot;
&quot; until that time , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue to pass over and therefore also resistance . &quot;
this report was heard by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis Reporting by the A@@ man as a Student Fel@@ low .
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
these big , ex@@ trav@@ ag@@ ant war@@ ri@@ bs are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Neb@@ uta festivals .
&quot; it is assumed that it is a variant of Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is also celebrated in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ cus . another theory was wo@@ und@@ ing over a thousand years , in the ar@@ mies of the West Japan , in the north @-@ east mar@@ ches around the indigenous people of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , into the knee . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to catch a few wonderful seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
you can only imagine how big these parts are ...
&quot; a common centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ mon@@ ati@@ ge exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally . &quot;
I looked at once again the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en again : two fes@@ ti@@ ques are straight to see .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori the Neb@@ uta Festival the only True - and still a breathtaking way to spend their summer : &quot;
&quot; Hallo , &quot;
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Sommer@@ festival in the north of the country .
I was there and I looked at the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ festival .
the view of a 18 meters high sho@@ ots was amazing .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

&quot; rarely , the phenomenon and body care were so important as in this story , because they help to maintain the Peru@@ vian youth from crime and promote a legi@@ timate profession like the hair@@ dressing room . &quot;
&quot; el Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where road@@ side and illegal drugs are daily . &quot;
&quot; a survey revealed in April 2017 , that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population did not feel safe . &quot;
Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for a@@ esthetic services for men .
&quot; the trend , the appearance and thus the sophisticated hair@@ style of famous ath@@ letes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Chile ) , Pedro gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , and N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , which can build these elabor@@ ate hair@@ style . &quot;
&quot; the un@@ preced@@ ented demand for hair@@ acids that go to the outside boundaries of fantas@@ y and creativity , even has an annual event inspired , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os &quot; , who has been taking place since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there are experts from each other , to show those of them can create the ex@@ cent@@ ric le@@ ooks , as you can see in the following video ( other videos on current competitions can be seen on the public Facebook @-@ profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , found here an opportunity to convince young people to share their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of poor advice on the hair@@ dressing tools that allows them to find work . &quot;
motivated of this activity and the most of the possibilities have seen do@@ zens of young people that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special educational workshops before in March beginning with special training workshops and reported about some of their achievements :
&quot; in 1995 we were the only specialist school in the church and the district , which we are very proud , because of love for the children we have built this educational community . &quot;
Colombia : love letters to gu@@ ardi@@ ans
photo : Valentina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with kind permission .
the following article is the processed version of the word &quot; lovemaking ste@@ amer &quot; which has released the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the article will be published here in a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people who we know ?
&quot; is it not even more important , people who feel like st@@ olen , aff@@ ection fig@@ hts ? &quot;
&quot; precisely this question went to the two young Colom@@ bian acti@@ vi@@ sts Leonardo P@@ Ã¡@@ r@@ rag@@ a by the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ art and C@@ risti@@ an Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation , and inspired it to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la Rec@@ on@@ cili@@ aci@@ Ã³n ( letters to reconciliation ) , the young people to do so . &quot;
&quot; only in Kurz@@ eme of a historical event , and they wanted to contribute their part to their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian Government had concluded a peace agreement with the Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ab@@ ew@@ ing F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Arm@@ ed For@@ ces of Colombia ) , which forms the lon@@ gues of the lon@@ gest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; international , the sign of peace treaty is as significant , that the Colom@@ bian President JosÃ© Manuel San@@ tos was received for its services in the No@@ bel Peace Prize . &quot;
&quot; however , in front of the Kolum@@ bian@@ ences , however , is a long way to be able to speak of real reconciliation , and of peace . &quot;
&quot; gu@@ err@@ illa war@@ ned that many years have been susp@@ ended in illegal camps , were exposed and round the clock their weapons in their lives , must now be integrated into life as civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society , in turn , who had acc@@ ustom@@ ed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep@@ ened hat@@ red from Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ak@@ Ã¤@@ mp@@ t , they have to record this now into their ranks and support them in building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and C@@ risti@@ an were convinced that young Colombia would like to close together and help integration process .
and exactly that they did so : until now have thousands of young people written letters - love bot@@ tw@@ ins to former Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ers in order to welcome them back in society .
the target of the campaign are 69@@ 00 B@@ uns - one for each former gu@@ ill@@ ers - which should be handed over personally .
the Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the letter to reconciliation was born on the world @-@ ap@@ ples of the No@@ bel Peace Prize , who took place in February 2017 in Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ . there were Leonardo and C@@ risti@@ an the opportunity to speak short with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ ar@@ th@@ i which was awarded the No@@ bel Prize . &quot;
&quot; explained that we love the people that we love , on Valent@@ ine &apos;s thousands of love letters , but those for@@ got that they need much necessary . &quot;
&quot; he tar@@ pau@@ lin , he told , he told his love to share his love with people who took the urgent promise . &quot;
&quot; in this way the plan , letters full of hope and support for former fighters of F@@ ARC , who now have to find their place in society and have to build up a new life . &quot; &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the dis@@ course of a war history to a common story of peace . &quot;
&quot; so far , in the context of the campaign were collected more than 2000 letters . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is present in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ . &quot;
I have never thought that someone would give me
the first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN camp in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region .
a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ art travel@@ ed into the camp to give the letters personally . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC set themselves on how they had done it earlier to accept the orders of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they had no commands , but letters full of sub@@ stitution of people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very mov@@ able moment for all involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings can walk in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; told the policy @-@ president Manuela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
Sandra Par@@ ra , a assistant of the govern@@ or of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca makes this unforgettable experience so : &quot;
after we had passed the letters , led me a former fighter through the camp of the gu@@ er@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut , where the gu@@ ardi@@ ans live ) I saw a gu@@ ardi@@ an@@ ers that wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I had fear , to pass , because besides him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ Gran@@ at@@ ering , a fat@@ al weapon in the village of the village . &quot;
&quot; I spoke him anyway and asked : &quot; &quot; hello , what do they just said ? &quot; &quot; I answered , &quot; &quot; I ask for a letter that someone has written me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never in my life he wrote me something so beautiful , that &apos;s why I suddenly met my t@@ ears about the che@@ eks . &quot;
I h@@ ug@@ ged it very well and set me in addition to the gran@@ ting .
&quot; perhaps he was compassion , was sorry to be all the years of fi@@ del@@ ity endanger@@ ed this fighter and he wanted to help him to write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he never had something different from life as war . the F@@ ARC was expecting him to preserve him , and his six brothers before the hunger strike . &quot; I had never imag@@ ined that anyone would for@@ give me for my mistakes . &quot;
&quot; but now I know that there is a society out there , which is waiting with open arms for us . &quot;
&quot; until now , I have only learned how I have to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; for the pr@@ el@@ ude came students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC to a discussion , together . &quot;
the students were all grown as already war and the F@@ ARC already worked in the twi@@ sted .
&quot; therefore the leaders of the F@@ ARC , the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave an insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; &quot; many years now , we have experienced the social inj@@ ustice on the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to contribute to a political party , we can contribute to the society in this country . &quot;
&quot; for a goal of these size , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
&quot; these people have never heard , who have never heard yet to be heard and not recognise that people who have often seen as monsters and even h@@ assen , even people with beautiful feelings , who were circum@@ fer@@ til@@ ted by their living conditions and their environment was very pain@@ ful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality , in which the country lives , does hurt me . &quot;
&quot; but it tr@@ act me that all men - even those who have killed and so much damage , we can bring something to us and give a smile and a hug . &quot;
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
&quot; Gust@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the com@@ mander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ Ã­@@ o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Arch@@ bis@@ hop of the town of Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot;
the Kolum@@ bian@@ s was proph@@ esi@@ ed that after the dra@@ ining of peace would reign .
but that is not the case .
&quot; as long as it inequality , hunger and lack of education , health and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are willing to draw up arms and to prot@@ est their rights ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we from F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without arms . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we call all def@@ ender of peace to - no matter which race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrific@@ es , because we know from their own experience that nothing is simple . those among us who defend life as the basis of existence , many difficulties are imp@@ ending . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; this follows the translation of an article , which was written by Un@@ listed Partner A@@ ida Mir@@ mak@@ sum@@ owa , and its initial publication on the OC Media workshop took place . &quot;
&quot; hom@@ osexu@@ als and que@@ er people who live in the Cau@@ cas@@ ian region , are exposed to a large range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail@@ ing . &quot;
with fri@@ ght@@ ers have experienced the reporting of the last few months on persecution Schw@@ ul@@ er &apos;s men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but the threat , which is like a di@@ amo@@ unting about the local LGB@@ T@@ Q church , it is not first created over night . &quot;
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ sn@@ y , which has shared with us some of their experiences with us and talked about what is happening in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; LGB@@ T@@ Q @-@ law in Ch@@ echn@@ ya , has published several months ago by the international head@@ lines , after reports published , torture , torture and tones of que@@ er men in the Republic of them@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the first report was published by the journ@@ alist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gas@@ eta , and cast a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , which took sus@@ pic@@ ious que@@ ers and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; they have brought a mon@@ ster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sabrina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gro@@ sn@@ y and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; already since their childhood has been noticeable that she was a woman in reality . &quot;
&quot; when they grew up , you became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya is not a safe place for her , why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Ch@@ echn@@ ya , experienced by the sex who had experienced their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened to Sabrina . &quot;
out of fear for her life she moved to the USA in the USA .
Sabrina : I was working as a volunte@@ er assistant at a human rights organisation .
one day I was told me that someone took my help .
&quot; it was a friend made of Dag@@ est@@ an , a trans@@ lady , who put in trouble in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took them without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , he made a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them throughout the internet , with my telephone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his voc@@ al friends , using the following message : &quot; &quot; then there are no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can eliminate these shame ? &quot;
then the photos of my documents made by all W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I was just here , a few shopping basket from the return of my car , I heard a male voice : &quot; &quot; here is a gift for you from your unc@@ le . &quot;
&quot; when I turned myself , I feel something in my body , but I did nothing . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a set , but this time on earth : &quot; &quot; how long do you still want to honor the family , you cry ? &quot;
I knew the person not .
&quot; I just know that there was a young man , no 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost the consciousness and wa@@ its of the last En@@ des in the hospital again .
&quot; apparently , some women had gotten everything and start writing . &quot;
the man was bra@@ ided .
the women had an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two stit@@ ching in my right lung .
OC Media : in which health care were you laid - in the men or women ?
&quot; Sabrina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name penet@@ rated ; but the doctor arose and put me to the women . &quot;
I am very grateful for this .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office , I got it with fear ; it was a mus@@ li@@ ant , a k@@ au@@ cas@@ ian name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful for that he respect@@ fully with me .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
last February I got threats .
&quot; they ri@@ ef@@ en me , wrote me - Related , stran@@ gers , some completely unknown . &quot;
this was the beginning of a night@@ space .
my family was attended by neighb@@ ors and some distant relatives .
the slow@@ s to return me to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all that was a lie .
&quot; they asked absur@@ d claims : some told me , I m@@ oss it , looking at the top without through the streets , and I say that I was not changed in the official television in Gro@@ sn@@ y , and say that I had not changed my sex that everything was just bad , and Photoshop . &quot;
I have bas@@ h size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family tries to handle this pressure ?
Sabrina : it is still hard for her .
some older men once said my mother on the road .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; they have brought a mon@@ ster to the world , not only your family , but the entire republic has damaged . &quot;
&quot; we cannot an@@ oke you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother was too much and she placed a stri@@ ck around the neck .
luck@@ ily the neighb@@ ors came and delivered them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later under the window a car with covered window disks and a number@@ ed plate with a 95 dr@@ aught .
&quot; after it happened to the third time , I was clear that there was something la@@ zy . &quot;
my human rights @-@ friends insp@@ ected the number@@ ing instrument - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how did you fled ?
Sabrina : with the help of acti@@ vi@@ sts .
&quot; for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to create their name , but I will say that I remember all of them ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with their help I left the country , but then something un@@ belief . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SI@@ M card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
&quot; I bought them , without writing without writing , without reve@@ aling , without everything . &quot;
I broke my old SI@@ M card and cast them to the g@@ arb@@ age .
came to and check@@ out into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stran@@ ger .
I put the SI@@ M card into my cell phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you do not think about , you are left in security , just because you left the country ? &quot;
&quot; our people already know , in which hotel you do . you even know your room number . &quot;
only to prove to you : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine it ? !
this was indeed my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sabrina : just with my mother and sisters .
&quot; however , we do not talk about sexual performance , however , this is a cell issue . &quot;
some traditionally Cau@@ cas@@ ian elements I still do in me .
so much I would also wish to overcome these se@@ el@@ ic barri@@ ers I can not overcome .
&quot; I always say that , as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them . &quot;
&quot; when we ch@@ atting with camera , I actually give me trouble such as the person who re@@ minds themselves from their past - so on my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends know , those who have stayed d@@ ort@@ as ? &quot;
Sabrina : I have filed a report in Washington last week .
for the needed I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I sp@@ ake with someone who have spent a half months in ar@@ gun .
&quot; he told that during the Ram@@ ad@@ an , no man was arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of the Ram@@ ad@@ an could hardly wait , and he closed a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
&quot; with that I mean , they probably invite the relatives , they take care of the problem with the person affected and in the end , that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; through blood gen@@ ug@@ tu@@ ung has experienced . &quot;
OC Media : are now still being arrested for pregnant men in these sec@@ rec@@ y ?
Sabrina : a known from me says there was not very many .
&quot; if , then above all such that have no rich relatives or have been abandoned by their relatives , to face K@@ inn@@ rows . &quot;
&quot; if I know , they will be arrested there , so that they can present them later as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say : should they be um@@ ent , one will show their bodies on television and claim , they could have been attacked either a village or a military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people would not simply disappear , but targeted inter@@ rup@@ ed to radi@@ cal . &quot;
OC Media : is that now only a mut@@ ation or do you have a source for this information ?
Sabrina : I have just returned someone who was one of the one half months in ar@@ gun .
he says that many people disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ard grew .
there was nothing new out of them .
they simply have put them into them .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself as these people were taken . &quot;
&quot; however , they were not introduced as ban@@ di@@ ts , so far there were no reports . we ref@@ used however , that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why else you would have not allowed these people to shave ?
&quot; know if these persec@@ utions and performances of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , already in the past ? &quot;
Sabrina : I always carried my hair for a long time .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I believe in 2003 I was already well known in Gro@@ sn@@ y when I lived there - and I never had problems .
in the Ernst !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the sh@@ aria was g@@ old , I had never problems . &quot;
on the contrary then it was much safer than now .
&quot; Russia wanted to lead us to the &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; , &quot; ultimately , has finally thrown back into the St@@ one@@ age . &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
Sabrina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were di@@ mm@@ ed ; I had colored eyelashes , carried RÃ¶@@ hren@@ je@@ ans and a short T@@ ops . &quot;
the Security Department of Sch@@ aria has never received a hair .
&quot; in front of the Russian theatre in Gro@@ sn@@ y there was a place where every evening , especially at weekends , a whole group of people met with me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several ben@@ ches were standing , and the whole city knew thereof ; they knew why men , young people , there met . &quot;
we have never been hon@@ oured .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a de@@ pot : K@@ now@@ a ma K@@ now@@ a . that is said : &quot; Sp@@ lice not about the un@@ happiness of another . &quot;
you often say it often to children if that make himself funny about sick .
&quot; OC Media : so they just have their eyes closed before you , because they believed , you are sick . &quot;
Sabrina : yes .
&quot; they have never been hon@@ oured , never before , and never be@@ aten . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this mercy seat ?
Sabrina : as long as K@@ inn@@ ro@@ v entered the plan .
&quot; when he became Prime Minister for Prime Minister , he started talking about mor@@ ality on TV . &quot;
&quot; he does not speak about us per se , but pre@@ domin@@ antly over the behaviour of women . &quot;
nevertheless - you could feel like the people in the city began to change .
who had pra@@ ised and liked to see you at once with Ar@@ g@@ ild@@ ing .
in the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel like the situation in the Republic has been steadily increasing . &quot;
OC Media : what job do you go to ?
Sabrina : I work as cell@@ ars .
I don &apos;t think much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the US are not much .
&quot; from that , I am still active as activ@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; currently , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women . &quot;
I communicate with them as a kind psych@@ olog@@ in .
&quot; we organize te@@ ac@@ re@@ ff , assem@@ bling , I asked them to hospital and help them to get the Essen@@ tial arts . &quot;
I don &apos;t have a cent sense of this .
I discovered these people myself as I cli@@ cked away .
I am Muslims and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : wear a Hid@@ den@@ ab ?
Sabrina : this is Algeri@@ an .
&quot; thus , nature , that has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ echn@@ ya that wants to proph@@ es@@ y to you with foam in front of the mouth , that there is no sw@@ ils with them . &quot;
&quot; the Dag@@ gers have which , the Cab@@ ard@@ iner have which the Rus@@ sians have also what the Rus@@ sians are , but on the whole planet it is - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; I come from there , that is why it is un@@ pleasant , sow@@ ing . &quot;
I see here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practic@@ ing Muslims who go into the mosque and during the Ram@@ ad@@ an f@@ asten - live with men .
&quot; know , many think during Transi@@ tional identity of men who love men , and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences . but this is a chest . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different types of sens@@ ation , to be accurate , different ways settings . &quot;
for me it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and not ash@@ amed for my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
sorry I &apos;m sorry that I will be so personally but my last in@@ time relationship is now more than one year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .

Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
&quot; the region , in which a major part of Iran living in the Arabic Ah@@ enn@@ az@@ i community is aff@@ lu@@ ded by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult to don@@ ate its life . &quot;
&quot; a century ago the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was an mainly autonom@@ ous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi @-@ Mon@@ archy took the power and 1925 large efforts to stop the eth@@ eric autonomy in the whole Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ z region , there are some of the largest in Iran ahead of oil and gas fields , as well as some of the most trag@@ e@@ rich@@ est and valuable areas for the Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to grow slowly , and the local population does not get enough of this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ form@@ ations . &quot;
the Iranian regime den@@ ied the Ah@@ enn@@ az@@ i Arab@@ s system@@ atically jobs in local oil@@ - , gas and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot;
&quot; the government also has a variety of twi@@ light , the waters of the Arab areas into the Persian areas where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m . &quot;
&quot; these d@@ ges have only led to wast@@ ing the dev@@ ast@@ ation in the region by drying , and the local agriculture , as well as the fish and pal@@ ms industry . &quot;
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi youth rose up to 81 % .
&quot; NO@@ UR Moh@@ amm@@ ed P@@ ur , the Irish General Director for Cooperation , Work and social welfare , announces that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is that have completed a job , the primary school ends , 55 % a university degrees at 45 % . &quot;
&quot; systematic strategy ... which is aimed to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
&quot; Kar@@ im Doh@@ im@@ i , an ir@@ an Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethical discrimination , &quot; to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of self @-@ discrimination among the young Ah@@ enn@@ az@@ i @-@ men . &quot;
&quot; Doh@@ im@@ i said that especially the unemployment has become more than ever worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of Ah@@ wa@@ z newly built @-@ ethnic Persian , and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the process of process : &quot;
&quot; because functioning and institutions are not preferred in Arabic labour , the local Arab Ah@@ enn@@ az@@ i will have access to work opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which is aimed to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arab@@ s , and to force them out of their home of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change its predec@@ essors and sur@@ names to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ z@@ az@@ i , as even Arabic names in the workplace are not toler@@ ated , because the speaking of the Arabic language or the mour@@ ning of Arab@@ ian clothing . &quot;

&quot; why I do not identify with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ section &quot;

&quot; the following article is a revised version of opinion written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i , and originally published on the website A@@ fro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as . the article was subject of several discussions , where many different positions came to expression . &quot;
you can read in the comments under the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am not femin@@ ist that many women - especially white women , who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fres@@ hness . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even set well through scientific and social arguments against me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we should generally be femin@@ ist * inside .
&quot; for example , women today still earn less money in spite of equal education than men . &quot;
that women are still under strict observ@@ ations if it is about what they can do with their body .
that violence against women is a global epid@@ emic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women sooner or later in various fields of life to a glori@@ ous blan@@ ket , and that discrimination based on sex still attr@@ acts through the many different countries and bel@@ iefs . &quot;
all of this is aware and known .
I am convinced of it and I &apos;m twice and triple .
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet , when I come to speak on skin colour , to rac@@ ism , on black CIS women , on black CIS women , on black women in the LGB@@ TI community , and on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a , and on black women have been physically , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , they left many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; but still all women - all women - together should come together to raise their voices , and &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya , my Lord &quot; to sing &quot; to reach the equality ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they do not want to talk about it , that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence is an institution@@ alized form raci@@ al violence , which we are exposed to black women on two @-@ fold species . &quot;
&quot; or on that black women and women of other eth@@ ics and country of origin , earn less than white men and women . &quot;
&quot; that black girl and girls with a migration background of the school are referred to as white girl , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
&quot; or that women in black spher@@ es and women are exposed to a higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in partnership , as white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want to join all the women , all men and all men every man , but on the other hand , I cannot join the same rights ; on the other hand , I am unable to consider myself as black woman who refuse to consider inj@@ ustice in their mind that refers both to the gender and skin colour . &quot;
&quot; I am exhau@@ sted and will no longer fight for my belonging in a white @-@ femin@@ istic environment , which me and countless other black women always has always rejected . &quot;
&quot; so@@ jour@@ ner be@@ kl@@ ed 18@@ 51 in her speech : &quot; &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and I also den@@ y myself to maintain an ideology , in which the black woman is in historical respect a dis@@ inf@@ ant and mar@@ gin@@ alized being . &quot;
&quot; I ref@@ used to assem@@ ble me group@@ ings , which also absor@@ b our customs and customs , in order to advance your ego@@ at program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try , white women gain the importance of survival of skin colour and gender . for some of them continue to remain the importance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement dead , no matter how many black women are trying to instruc@@ t them a better . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different subjects to give a home and down from the white femin@@ ism , is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in his name . &quot;
&quot; I stand it before , to put me full of femin@@ ism and to close me to the movement of the W@@ om@@ an@@ ism that has been launched for my dark skin and my status as wife in life , rather than a non @-@ femin@@ ist para@@ dig@@ m is being celebrated as a new phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; now it is more important than ever , that we define black women to define our own ideas and enter into the spher@@ es that we will be created for us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author in the book of Afri@@ cana , ( e.g. : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves in this way , where we can defend ourselves in this way and in which the cultural , mental , spiritual , bo@@ di@@ ly , and even the spiritual elements can be wor@@ shipped . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion , please read this lines to inform yourself about the hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y and contradictions of femin@@ ist movement , some of which the black woman is affected . &quot;
&quot; in a wom@@ an@@ ist environment , I can raise black women and women of other cultures , as in this para@@ dig@@ m , I have existed . &quot;
I will be recognized because of my dark skin and due to my existence as a woman as part of this para@@ dig@@ m .
&quot; I , a black woman , can prev@@ ail in an environment in which my life is neither passed , nor ignored . &quot;

Paraguay Women and their more difficult struggle against violence

&quot; the following article is the short@@ ened and processed version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series of Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ rd ) , who reported on violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
most names have been changed for the protection of persons concerned .
&quot; a police miss@@ ary said Ad@@ a B@@ Ã¡@@ ez that she has nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex@@ partners who has been working towards violent . &quot;
&quot; since the end of its relationship was some time passed and the police said , their statement would be put into the acts , but more could not do . &quot;
&quot; as another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena because of failure , Use@@ ful also the ak@@ ten@@ te display of Ad@@ a B@@ Ã¡@@ ez nothing . &quot;
a few days later the second woman moved back their ad .
&quot; to break the devil price of violence against women , is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if women need to show at all time , they do not receive support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also dependent on the men that they mis@@ sil@@ es . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who ad@@ mit victims of violence , to exist at all with the prosec@@ ution authorities . &quot;
&quot; inhal@@ er and Statisti@@ c 2 Un@@ visible Mis@@ cellaneous and a legal system , which is nothing more imm@@ uni@@ fied laws : good approach , lack of implementation and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is hard to determine how many women really fails , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , Res@@ eller for Gen@@ der@@ aci@@ Ã³n y E@@ studios , a soci@@ alisation of research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various information and reports , which does not even indicate the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
but the figures related numbers are al@@ arm@@ ing .
in 2015 during the district of the district prosec@@ ution 9@@ 600 displays of domestic violence against domestic violence . at 70 % of it was about violence against women .
86 % of the ads on police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads on domestic violence against the peace of peace . also here are 86 % of the ads of women .
&quot; in the ads , 40 % of women , that they were physically fed , 55 % of women said of psych@@ ic abuse . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the information of the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Women Minister , Bai@@ ard@@ i will only be shown a few of these criminal off@@ ences . &quot; &quot; to any woman who will be rei@@ mb@@ urs@@ ed in Paraguay due to psych@@ ic abuse ad , 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; upon every woman who is rei@@ mb@@ urs@@ ed because of physical abuse , two women who do not do , &quot; explained at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since Frauen@@ m@@ ord in Paraguay does not have an own criminal off@@ ences , the prosec@@ ution authorities may not be appropri@@ ately documented how many women are mur@@ dered by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; until August 2016 , journalists reported at least 12 cases of women in the country . &quot;
the coordin@@ ator of human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were mur@@ dered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to their estimates , in Paraguay all ten days a woman because of violence caused by men . &quot;

invisible missions and a legal system that assumes nothing
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z was the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she knew him the names of all their former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning she did not want it , but still after . this should she lay down for ever . &quot;
&quot; today Mari@@ ana 28 years old and no more with Carlos together . but two years ago , the psych@@ ic violence in turn - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time most recogni@@ z@@ able : &quot;
I have never thought that I would have been victims of abuse .
&quot; if I have read earlier about it , I always thought that the only women has happened to sub@@ mis@@ sive , because they dec@@ ei@@ ve themselves by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that I would never happen that .
Mari@@ ana usable social media to report about the Mis@@ cellaneous by Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name to name , she wrote articles on Facebook where they compl@@ ements its insul@@ ts and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship and told me how he was isolated . &quot;
&quot; many people answer to their contributions , including Carlos itself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ically , whether he ever raised the hand against them and consec@@ rated that his behaviour was also a form of failure . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook users ques@@ tioned Mari@@ ana , why they left the so long of Carlos I had not left it before . &quot;
it seemed almost as they wanted to say that victims of failure at least had a certain comp@@ licity to blame .
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos that origin@@ ate not from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner they mis@@ led . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te cre@@ o ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that are made of women all in any way victims of failure .
&quot; in the group , they can speak with others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case everything started with psych@@ ic abuse .
their prosper@@ ous partner stayed it finally even to convince them that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat her .
&quot; Vict@@ ori@@ as advertisements in the authorities remain without the result and also of their relatives , she received no support . &quot;
&quot; it carried out a process against their former partners , who developed into an un@@ imagin@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and their home country where it mainly went to money , power and influence of their former partner . &quot;
Paraguay laws : good approach , lack of implementation
in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good but not applied .
&quot; the display of failure is a way of resist@@ ors and a fight against corruption in judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organization for Women in Paraguay , sees also major problems in the application of laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament was discussed in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament , which was known under the has@@ ht@@ ag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # FÃ¼r@@ st ) . &quot;
&quot; this ha@@ ht@@ ag and the movement # Ni@@ U@@ na@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ profit ) are part of a campaign on Twitter , which is supported by Am@@ nest@@ y International . &quot;
&quot; the original design of the law looks before , Fem@@ izi@@ d to explain and harder to explain and t@@ oug@@ her as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia . &quot;
&quot; so the Leg@@ est@@ ext is altered in some points to also win the Members for the law , the advoc@@ ates that the path for de@@ cri@@ min@@ alisation of Ab@@ t@@ ment will be b@@ anned , which are currently b@@ anned in Paraguay and can be pun@@ ished up to five years in prison . &quot;
&quot; the original bill had provided , most of the ( bureau@@ crati@@ c and economic ) procedures that need to wear the victims of violence currently , if they simply need to refund and secure a safe place to present the state . &quot;
&quot; Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective unless the legisl@@ ator does not provide adequate financial resources for them : &quot;
in Paraguay is seen a part of inter@@ human relationships .
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking must take place , so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal . &quot;
&quot; who is wel@@ ded with this facts , makes themselves guil@@ ty and contributes to the perpet@@ rators of the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; we have to refund so long display , until there is no more than normal . &quot;
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . previously , parts of the law has been changed , among other things , the partners were rep@@ aired in cases of domestic violence . &quot;
the opinions about the changes are apart .
the section regarding Rec@@ on@@ ciliation was seen as an occasion for the ag@@ gres@@ sor its victim again .
&quot; the p@@ etting of words &quot; gender &quot; , &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law is considered to be a great backl@@ ash . &quot;

independent media in O@@ man have to ban a year after pro@@ hibition of a newspaper further attack
&quot; this website was locked due to a resolution of the information Minister , the homepage of the Forbidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
more than one year the om@@ ic authorities have closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting on corruption in the sult@@ ant .
&quot; You@@ sef Al @-@ ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison , where he burned one year old harbour . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and put before dish , and later came back . &quot;
&quot; O@@ man has reig@@ ned by Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us ib@@ n S@@ aid , who came into power after he had his father , S@@ aid ib@@ n T@@ aim@@ ur , through a state @-@ kingdom . &quot;

&quot; the authorities restri@@ ct peaceful and legi@@ timate activities in the field of human rights system@@ atically and hin@@ ders citizens , also acti@@ vi@@ sts , about their views on public affairs of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , her clos@@ es and the inf@@ ant of three of their editors in the last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country . &quot;
&quot; Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , in which since its establishment has been reported on corruption in O@@ man ( an absolute mon@@ archy ) until they have b@@ anned from the authorities in August 2016 . &quot;

&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ amari and Al @-@ ha@@ j , both among other things were condem@@ ned because of the disturb@@ ance of the public order , mis@@ use of the internet &quot; and &quot; sub@@ mis@@ ation of the pres@@ idency of the state &quot; . &quot; &quot;
al @-@ ha@@ j has been beyond the violation of a publication of publication and le@@ ather@@ ings for guil@@ ty .
al @-@ Ma@@ amari and Al @-@ ha@@ j have been sentenced to three years imprison@@ ment and bank@@ roll in the amount of 3000 om@@ ic finishes ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . in addition , a year @-@ year vocational training was condem@@ ned against the two journalists . &quot;

&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ amari was born on 10 April 2017 , after the trial of his six@@ teen prison quarters in mas@@ ked . al @-@ ha@@ j is still in prison , where he burned his one year sentence . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it war@@ ers 2016 in Zam@@ bia , figure is done with his consent . &quot;
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media only rarely or at all . this is a growing area that is one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
&quot; for the need for local medical research , there are two reasons : for a lack of global health estate many medicines and vacc@@ ines which cover the special medical need on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ culos@@ is and mal@@ aria have a great problem in the poor@@ est countries of Africa as elsewhere , and lack of investment for the research of these diseases through the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem . &quot;

&quot; he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zam@@ bia , just as the AIDS @-@ epid@@ emic first gra@@ ving impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Sam@@ bia for a study in the United States , initially in Louis@@ iana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania on HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ ic healthcare system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. Aug@@ er discussed the future of medical research in Zam@@ bia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of media about this research . &quot;
( disclaimer : Dr. bru@@ er speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it war@@ k R@@ W : at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results . support I support the sam@@ b@@ ical national program for Anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral therapy ( ART ) with Lab@@ ort@@ ests .
&quot; in addition , I just start a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ ogen@@ s . &quot;
G@@ V : what do you think about the important current academic issues in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
R@@ W : there is no basic research . we only put solutions to which the other has been developed .
&quot; this must change , otherwise we will always keep recei@@ vers , instead of his fe@@ eder . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that we get , are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use it here . &quot;
G@@ V : where does finance and support come from ?
is it adequate ?
how simple or difficult it is to find suitable scientists to the projects ?
R@@ W : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are extremely well supported .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who come back or want to get here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
G@@ V : how is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research work that you don &apos;t had before ?
R@@ W : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
G@@ V : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
R@@ W : there are interest but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; G@@ V : how big is your opinion on the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on , and how can we support the development ? &quot;
R@@ W : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there are need for special scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , research of space , public health ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious illness ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ V : can you describe us the advantages and cons of life as a scientist in Africa , based on your experience ? &quot;
R@@ W : often there are the limited speed things to do and the access to scientific expertise that represent these challenges .
&quot; the system that magazines are available only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited the amount of availability and the speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; - seed producers will change global food production
&quot; this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on solv@@ ent possibilities for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank M@@ orton already worked in the US Sal@@ at for the 1980s .
&quot; his company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ ge@@ ous , the first plant that has been cultiv@@ ated by NA@@ SA @-@ ast@@ ron@@ aut in space . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years of Mort@@ ons work was only carried out by its own influences and the question , how many sal@@ ads can get limits . &quot;
but at the beginning of the 2000@@ s he had pat@@ ented that more sal@@ ads were pat@@ ented and that he could not use them further on the bre@@ eder .
&quot; the patents have not only been used for individual sorts , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , more and more such patents have been signed up on more plants such as cer@@ eals and cartridges locations . due to these trends make a plant breeding , environmental protective and atom@@ izer for food security for the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representatives of an mill@@ en@@ nia tradition b@@ orton still sal@@ ad , he still needs more , since his work is getting more and more constra@@ ined . &quot;
&quot; it is , as would be in a river a rock bro@@ cks , around which I have to g@@ ump@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; so we need to do this now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , he says . &quot; I think that these patents go to sal@@ ads too far . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand before judgment , then no one can move more a new sal@@ ad , because all the characteristics are already pat@@ ented . it thus makes as good as possible and tries to breed those features . &quot;
&quot; however , he is very careful and stri@@ ves to use any material that is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
he also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the USA and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ Bre@@ eding ) .
&quot; ast@@ ron@@ auts at the International Space Station IS@@ S have red red red@@ und@@ y in the &quot; gre@@ enh@@ ouses &quot; of the station b@@ red and e@@ aten . there will be tested , whether plants in space will be cultiv@@ ated . &quot;

&quot; it is not a coinci@@ dence that this name is rather so sounds , when the movement comes from the IT area , and not of the area of plant breeding . &quot;
&quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; &quot; Sa@@ at@@ well ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; software insp@@ ire alternatives to copy@@ righted software . &quot;
&quot; it was launched to life , to ensure that some plant types and indigenous people are not protected as intellectual property and are permanently usable for plant bre@@ eders . &quot;
&quot; within the framework of the initiative , briefly O@@ ssi , you can commit US @-@ bre@@ eder that others can use the seed of them . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do with their seed , and they can buy it . &quot; open source &quot;
do@@ zen bre@@ eders and seed company have already been connected to the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
d@@ sc@@ aff@@ er prospects
&quot; for the em@@ eri@@ fied Professor of the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ssi Commissioner to control over the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important for food security as well as for environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; according to him , it plays a role in larger compositions such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to use the latter , not or only little by using seeds with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; movement does not work with gene@@ tically modified plants .
&quot; all kinds of plants could be pat@@ ented whether vegetables , corro@@ sion , modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; to purchase our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seed company , which is offered in August or September 2016 , how it is offered on peas@@ ant markets , it should also know that the way it is b@@ red in August and September 2016 . &quot;
nutri@@ tion@@ ality without Sa@@ at@@ ben@@ ign is not possible .
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to providing support to others their seed . thus , their approach is to pat@@ enting themselves , as opposed to that , seed and plant characteristics . &quot;

&quot; O@@ ssi @-@ suppor@@ ters ar@@ gue that the future of the food supply is at risk , since the available genital pool due to the increasingly paid @-@ related intellectual property rights on plant material which is thus always reduced , in@@ dul@@ ged shr@@ ink@@ y . &quot;
&quot; Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , Executive director of O@@ ssi , has worked in their doctor@@ al work with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . it found out that roughly one third of all cart@@ ography are protected as intellectual property as an intellectual property , either not or only comp@@ elling . &quot;
&quot; for other plants there are such estimates yet , but experts like Lu@@ by ver@@ mu@@ te that mass@@ aged plants like wheat are pat@@ ented as sal@@ ad or car@@ rots . &quot;
a question of view
&quot; plants will be so b@@ red that they make them targeted characteristics - from such , through which their taste or colour enh@@ ances up to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments , and threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
opponents of cartridges on plant characteristics point out that the available plant material for bre@@ eders are due to increasingly more patents . genetic diversity is currently necessary than ever since the changing conditions due to climate change is much worse .
&quot; in an email , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ Spe@@ aker Car@@ ly S@@ ca@@ du@@ to that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four com@@ modities and cooperation with institutions such as the agricultural Ministry of the United States . &quot;
&quot; they however , however , however , however , the view that spiritual property holds other bre@@ eders , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant vari@@ et@@ als innovations . &quot; &quot; a patent is essentially a plan that can follow each one as soon as the patent is ex@@ pi@@ red . &quot;
&quot; often , these instructions helps others to come with another method for the same result . &quot;
&quot; such protection is not as innovations , but promotes them by providing the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
&quot; M@@ orton sees the other : 20 years to wait , until a patent dis@@ continued , stret@@ cher certainly no innovations . &quot;
&quot; and if you are waiting for so long to wait to cro@@ ps , which are adapted to the modified environmental conditions , one could have lost the struggle already . &quot;
&quot; the main rubber@@ ent for M@@ orton is however that genetic resources have always been a common good and they should continue to remain : &quot; &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders have neither the time nor money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ ary incentives are not attractive for us . &quot;
we want farmers easier .
&quot; this is what drives us , and it will be impossible if we do not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; in a total of disturb@@ ing M@@ orton is structured on the concept to pat@@ enting , plant characteristics : &quot; we do not create the characteristics of itself . &quot;
&quot; the plants make them out of and as bre@@ eders , we finally have no idea how the plants do this . &quot;
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for Car@@ ol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US @-@ state Oregon and O@@ ssi committee member , there is still another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who also b@@ red his own values in it . &quot;
&quot; who believes in industrial agriculture with great cour@@ ty@@ ards and mon@@ oc@@ ultur@@ es , for their cultivation of mass@@ age@@ ous her@@ bi@@ cides in his varieties of farming . &quot;
my concept is exactly ent@@ angl@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that have to move on international markets , but small as Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , make it the most smaller seed company , even without patents - either reject it or hold it for too expensive and therefore not rewar@@ ding or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant breeding Frank M@@ orton is searching in his breeding garden Sal@@ ads .

&quot; M@@ orton is also the view that bre@@ eders through the avoid of plant pat@@ ched innovative would : &quot; &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies , the pat@@ enting . &quot;
&quot; I need to constantly sell new material for my catalogue because I know that my competitors is being sold in a couple of years ago , he says . &quot; &quot; with a patent one is protected for 20 years before competition , which makes it very easy for me . &quot; &quot; worldwide reson@@ ance &quot;
&quot; though the US seem to be leading in the &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; breeding leader , but now the concept has grown rapidly over the world . &quot;
&quot; in India the centre for sustainable agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which works itself as professional organization in the field of resources , an &quot; open source &quot; &quot; seed program . &quot; to preserve the seed company , the center with farmers together and helps them to breed new varieties , which meet certain requirements . &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ Sa@@ at@@ well and sell their own .
&quot; the German organization Agre@@ co@@ l works on an &quot; open source &quot; license , which ultimately determines a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ssi commitment to bre@@ eders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( regulations for the bre@@ eders differ from country to country , present their commitment to one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive committee of the European Union , the European Commission , declar@@ es that conventional plants should not be pat@@ ented . thus , it speaks to the present practice of the European patent market , which allows patents on conventional plants . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not a law yet ; now it is on the governments of the Member States to put forward this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization hi@@ v@@ os had a conference to &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; Sa@@ at@@ ben@@ ign in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operator of Sa@@ at@@ ben@@ ch@@ banks and the representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organizations and seed company from all over East Africa to learn about the &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards the pat@@ enting of seed . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; Sa@@ at@@ gut@@ systeme , that the organization currently manages a global alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; Sa@@ at@@ ben@@ zer , for which plan next year of the official start signal . &quot;
&quot; a cl@@ asp from environmental protection and development groups ( including hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit organization US@@ C Canada and the action group on ero@@ sion , technology and Concent@@ ration ) has compiled a database to seed and biodiversity , to release the Se@@ ed Map Project , a Sa@@ at@@ well @-@ map . &quot;
&quot; in September the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report published as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report published , it represents that farmers have to come to seed and to ensure that a stable supply of food is ensured . &quot;
&quot; in the report , the importance of a varied , local supply of seeds be stressed for sustainable food systems - a connection to the Lu@@ by by O@@ ssi hopes that will soon see him more people soon . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has grown above all , where and how something is cultiv@@ ated , and seed systems have hardly ever played a role , so Lu@@ by . &quot; we now try to make people compl@@ ain , that is even more behind their foods . &quot;

Human rights organization and Blog are the latest objectives of the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
still lock the Egyptian authorities content on the internet .
&quot; this time , it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ sten . &quot;
&quot; on the weekend around the 05 @-@ August the Egyptian government has documented the website of Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which reports human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world . &quot;
&quot; August released the network an opinion on Facebook , in which it critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information St@@ bt@@ - despite this attack and the constitution of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities to cover , so it was never as difficult as now . AN@@ HR@@ I confirmed that all technical possibilities should be exhau@@ sted to overcome the barrier and do not re@@ conc@@ ede to fulfil our task . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is regarded as the first zen@@ ed website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities block@@ ed more than two months of 21 websites , like e.g. the independent message from Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , and that of Qatar &apos;s network of Al Jaz@@ e@@ era &quot; because of the &quot; &quot; support of terrorism &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; besides AN@@ HR@@ I also exists on the blog of the colum@@ ni@@ sten and human rights , Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada no access to Egypt . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of Kolum@@ nen and articles , which he is not called for non @-@ independent websites and media in Egypt . &quot;
&quot; now the blog , he was built to handle the tick @-@ appar@@ atus of the Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blog@@ gers , the supplier in which also Zi@@ adas blog native , on the other hand is further accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journ@@ alist , spent nearly 500 days in cap@@ tivity when he was arrested in December 2013 by Egyptian security forces while he attended the police physical violence against two students . &quot;
his article focuses primarily about politics and human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada led to the blo@@ cking by the government and reflect what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; the , blogs to lock is very old , however , in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even though the blo@@ cking of blogs may not be significant for the world , so it is for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has succeeded to conv@@ ey the feeling of a revival ; an ar@@ rests murder , pre@@ ach by the national Security Council , the blo@@ cking blogs as well as any other web page for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proven that I wrote not in else . in other words , my words have influence , if only on a small audience . &quot;
I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to the post of articles in order to handle the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
&quot; however , after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the mu@@ sty go the way up to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 . August 133 websites . this erg@@ ent technical tests in networks of various Internet Service Provider ( IS@@ P ) , including Orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at . &quot;
&quot; AF@@ TE documented also the blo@@ cking of providers , through the relocation of dor@@ mit@@ ories and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ PN@@ s ) &quot;
AF@@ TE reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , the 12th of June we noticed how the blo@@ cking of websites , the V@@ PN@@ s began . &quot;
such practice indicates the intention of the government to block the content to block and filter@@ ed to the Egyptian user .
&quot; the situation will additionally be wast@@ ed that the tick @-@ decisions taken behind closed doors , thereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis , helping them face trial against these actions . &quot;
now the question : how far is the Egyptian government ready with the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and whom will it be next attack ?
is Rio de Janeiro in the war ?
the inhabitants are riding .

day for day report papers in all Brazil with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous Post@@ card mot@@ ive . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ year was shot in school , &quot; &quot; J@@ one second day becomes a police officers in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Di@@ ebe fl@@ ass@@ ed pharm@@ acies with military weapons from , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er , 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Marine and Air Sal@@ af@@ e to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the thres@@ hold in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years . &quot;
the Bra@@ zi@@ lian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice could even call the United Nations to interven@@ e .
&quot; reports like these are everyday and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 , at least the managers of a local newspaper . &quot;
&quot; so published the detailed coverage of violence in Rio well known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on 16th August the editorial &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; in which it introduced a new section called &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city will be published there .
the moti@@ ves for their decision explained the newspaper so :
&quot; extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in each major city in the world like murder , Rau@@ b , sexu@@ al@@ ver@@ breaking , etc . all what happened from the civili@@ zed standard , and what only happens in Rio &quot; will be published in the category &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; ( ... ) This is our way , to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
&quot; this is the only alternative , so that we do not close our eyes before the atro@@ ci@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video , which was divided on Facebook , explained Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the Editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper that this decision was no occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
extra is probably the only newspaper in the whole world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that does not recognise the war at all .
&quot; at the same video a journ@@ alist of the newspaper , that there is still controlled by the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , which are controlled by criminal organisations . &quot;
in the editorial article writes the newspaper further :
&quot; conscious of us is aware that a war is disc@@ rete , if it is dist@@ ort@@ ed , also to be used , gr@@ asp the police , which only sho@@ ots and then ask questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , its aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Maf@@ ia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; more than they are useful ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Brasil ar@@ gues about the journ@@ alist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , against the violence as &quot; war &quot; . &quot; this is their opinion according to a justi@@ fication of the trained security policy through the media and could be mis@@ understood , responsibilities in the police . &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as an extra in the analysis of the dairy farmers in Rio itself - in combination with in@@ sufficient investment in personnel , clari@@ fication and a historic and self @-@ neg@@ li@@ ous negl@@ ect of public service . &quot;
to memory : the federal state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital .

he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal matters , the classification of the situation in Rio as war is also serious consequences for people after themselves . &quot;
&quot; for this requires the state upon , resources and ways to use the typical for a war . this is one of the int@@ ru@@ sion into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civil war is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and to the object for &quot; coll@@ ater@@ al damage . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war suffer many sy@@ mpt@@ om cities under bru@@ tal si@@ ege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime towards lo@@ y@@ ale troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victory Watch , a common initiative of peace organisation pax and the Forschungs@@ institut The Syria Institute , are located in Dam@@ asc@@ us and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , D@@ ei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of exposure . &quot;
&quot; especially strongly affected is the region East Gh@@ out@@ a , where an attack with chemical weapons held on 21 August 2013 . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition assume that based on studies of the United Nations and other human rights organizations that the mass@@ acres of Assad has been ex@@ ert@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these of reb@@ els are carried out outside of Dam@@ asc@@ us under si@@ ege , which led to that citizens are dependent on local , or by tunnel and control points . &quot;
&quot; due to the years of block@@ age , traditional foods such as meat become un@@ reachable for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter @-@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics the inhabitants of Eastern Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; &quot; life @-@ saving food source &quot; . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da and perform the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms do not belong to conventional , in Syria , and are only extremely rare part of Syrian cuisine . their food is however makes it an attractive foods for many residents of the busy East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the Loc@@ ated of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we chose to cultiv@@ ate fung@@ us because they have high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed L@@ eila , one of the organiz@@ ers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , that has been fighting for three years , this project was well @-@ known and oppressed its relief that there is now more and more &quot; &quot; commitment &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to collect money for the initiative , use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ as . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to conv@@ ey 125 families knowledge of the pl@@ anting of fung@@ us , as Dr. L@@ eila to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected destination from around 12.@@ 700 â¬ but are until Monday , the 04 . September 2017 , will continue to raise funds on Can@@ Do . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is dependent on generators , which keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % . &quot;
because of fuel the fuel consumption will be used locally in order to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; Dr. L@@ eila said Global Vo@@ ices , that they began with the &quot; &quot; Production of &quot; &quot; fung@@ al &quot; &quot; before they super@@ vis@@ e their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; afterwards , they pl@@ anted a small mush@@ room in a tub . as this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
&quot; now they have created a &quot; &quot; Teachers &quot; &quot; for the region . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
Dr. L@@ eila declared that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to bring people the fung@@ al breeding of various reasons &quot; &quot; : bro@@ ch of si@@ ege . &quot;
providing a new source of food on the market .
&quot; spread of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency ( like paper , tea , coffee boxes , cardboard , etc ) for the production of new foods . &quot;
&quot; creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home . &quot;

&quot; we appreciate that there were more than 500 fire@@ places , which were spread across the northern and centrally located regions of the country and reached about 250 million acres of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June , in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande is a similar tragedy , where there were 64 death@@ s and more than 200 verses . &quot;
&quot; according to the European for@@ estry system , which monitors the forest surfaces via satellite recordings , are alone 2017 in Portugal about 500@@ .000 acres of forest burned - an area of the size of the district Lisbon . &quot;

&quot; furthermore , building projects in loc@@ alization with high bran@@ dr@@ is@@ iko is ques@@ tioned . &quot;
&quot; a far @-@ reaching proposal to the forest @-@ shape , which had brought the government to serious bre@@ wing in the years 2003 and 2005 , the new rules was seen as an obstacle to investment . &quot;

&quot; in one night in the autumn of 1994 , the con@@ quest of Afghanistan started by the Taliban . &quot;
&quot; two years ago had been a fur@@ ious civil war between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ ed@@ in group@@ ings , which had defe@@ ated the short@@ ened pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan had become a land of terror and desp@@ air . &quot;
&quot; exactly at this time of Alsace Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , which belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central @-@ gh@@ an@@ istan for the last time with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even though his mother it was not so said , so she knew that she would no longer see her son very long - maybe even more . &quot;
in the dawn should break the boy .
its unc@@ le would bring him and bring him to the locks .

&quot; module Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of Haz@@ ara domin@@ ates party He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ W@@ ah@@ dat was just been mur@@ dered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara have suddenly been un@@ condition@@ ally un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot;
the Taliban known for their hat@@ red on Haz@@ ara @-@ known Taliban always came closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his flight I found A@@ shar@@ p@@ y in Pakistan again .
for a few years he worked in a cohesion . the work was heavy and made him sick .
&quot; then he took the what was left from his little sal@@ ary , and went in Iran . once again he was born in a foreign country together with other refugees , and sm@@ ashed s@@ lu@@ cent with mur@@ derer , the harder than he himself to make himself his way of living . &quot;
&quot; back then , as today the life of Afgh@@ an refugees was characterised by El@@ end and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , it re@@ minded itself in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in a le@@ ague building on the construction site , on which we also worked . &quot;
there was no services there and no heating . we hang@@ ed n@@ ylon before the open windows so that we are not rede@@ emed at night .
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ p@@ her left his life without papers in Iran and ready for travel to Europe . &quot;
&quot; during the dangerous passage to the sea , he aw@@ aken ship@@ quar@@ ry and sp@@ ake on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek government had rejected its asylum issue , A@@ shar@@ p@@ af came to Italy . &quot;
&quot; some time was A@@ shar@@ p@@ ed hom@@ eless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church , which distributed twice a day of food and need@@ y . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy due to relatively high weap@@ on@@ ry pre @-@ quot@@ as is a sort of second chance for ex@@ ile asylum seek@@ ers , but it is also true that the conditions that can pro@@ claim asylum seek@@ ers in the country , cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
&quot; Human Rights Organization Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system operates under a general lack of transparency . &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of the asylum seek@@ ers will be accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; special recording centres . &quot; this is an impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ skilled and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be communic@@ ated to an e@@ over center , if it officially put a request for asylum seek@@ ers - which can still move forward to the registration of the asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; until then people who have no money for accommodation , either on the hospitality of friends , or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
&quot; but its un@@ avo@@ idable life @-@ wild , he helped to free from these conditions . &quot;
&quot; after spending several years of different works in the construction of construction , the A@@ shar@@ p@@ ples the entire savings into the creation of a hostel in Venice . &quot;
this was so good that he opened a second hostel after a while .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati@@ s success story is now theme of the documentation &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Vene@@ tian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director A@@ min W@@ ah@@ id@@ i .
&quot; the film was awarded for Venice City Award , the 2017 was already awarded for the 24th time . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to in@@ official estimates , some 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
for many of them the country is a transi@@ tional solution on the way to other European countries .
&quot; in recent years some of Afghanistan were founded , including tail@@ oring , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afgh@@ ans restaurants were even taught in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ahm@@ adi had the idea to its restaurant Ori@@ ent Experience , in which the wa@@ iter and the kitchen were largely refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant tells us through the various af@@ gh@@ an , Ira@@ qi , Turkish and Greek courts , the history of their trip to Italy . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an ent@@ repren@@ eur Ali Kh@@ an Q@@ se@@ ari opened in Padua the Restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a Sus@@ hi Restaurant in Rome are also available in Afghanistan .
&quot; however , A@@ shar@@ k &apos;s goals range however far beyond the Italian gastronomic landmarks and the retail and aim to go back to the country which he had to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where a risk is , also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I would like to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I never forget my country and I can not live happy if I know that my people suffer .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of the society and have to get the same possibilities as anyone else .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ p@@ ses also smi@@ ths plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and preser@@ v@@ ative techniques . &quot; thus , they can sell their seri@@ ousness on the market and improve their financial situation . &quot;
&quot; the development of successful entrepreneurs was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end stand stability and prosperity . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af has made this trip itself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this way .

&quot; global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ ti@@ zen report is an international snapshot , the challenges , vict@@ ories and emerging trends in global internet rights &quot;
&quot; the Egyptian Parliament checked a legislative activity , which fores@@ aw that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after a registration in a government authority . &quot;
&quot; users would have to be able to use social networks , within six months after successful legislation on the website of the authority under indication of its full name and delivery number . &quot;
those who take this step could be sentenced to up to six months in cust@@ ody or the exp@@ ir@@ ation of a criminal proceedings .
&quot; the law , which was advertis@@ ed by sixty parliament@@ arians , there is currently the legislative and con@@ stitut@@ ed Com@@ it@@ ee of the parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; may be another member of the member of a law , in which harder criminal off@@ ences were introduced for the ins@@ ult of the president or a high officials . &quot;
&quot; under the Egyptian law , the re@@ formation of the President as well as government institutions are already pun@@ ish@@ able . under the Leg@@ isl@@ ation , a such act would be ground@@ ed with pris@@ oner and bank@@ notes , so legal experts of Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; should the law be adopted , this may mean up to three years imprison@@ ment for the condem@@ ns . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , this would be a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of expression has been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a mark@@ er example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o zi@@ d ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) which was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he demonstrated violence against prot@@ esters , which demonstrated against the military put@@ sch , who had led against the military put@@ ted by Moh@@ amm@@ ed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan expected , as expected as more than 700 prot@@ est participants , which were arrested at the same occurr@@ ence , four years in cust@@ ody on a court of court . &quot;
&quot; recently , he post@@ pon@@ ed his on the 20th May occas@@ ional negoti@@ ation , because the pris@@ als according to human rights groups did not fail to bring the def@@ endants of prison in the court hall . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups are rede@@ emed , hy@@ st@@ acy of inter alia , illegal assembly , murder and negoti@@ ated murder . &quot;
&quot; in another case a prison quarters in G@@ iza , the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary free . they were indic@@ ted for their reporting to pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block at Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ Ad@@ a@@ wi@@ ya place in C@@ airo . &quot;
&quot; the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Ab@@ dull@@ ah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ af@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , which were also arrested in previous inci@@ dent , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
Tunis@@ ian acti@@ vi@@ sts to be heard of documents
&quot; may Tunis@@ ian authorities six hours with the trial of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform N@@ awa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy Project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly studied by the President of the Republic , according to the plan of the Republic , according to the plan expressly provided a contro@@ vers@@ y bill , the business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali &apos;s corruption acc@@ used to Am@@ nest@@ y officer , provided that these are all un@@ law@@ ful money . &quot;
&quot; this document published on 21 April on the website of N@@ awa@@ at published document , thro@@ ws a light on how the preventive plans for the support of the law@@ suit . &quot;
Ben G@@ har@@ bia proves the N@@ aming of its sources under consideration of article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press ko@@ dex@@ es who sec@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources .
&quot; nevertheless , he entered the District Court in Tunis on 09 . may as a witness in the case . &quot;
will China enter the users of social media to present their credit card ?
&quot; according to new rules of the information office of the National Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , users need a approval of social media in China , before they write messages in social media . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with the regulations , registration will be necessary to register with the full recur@@ ring name . &quot;
&quot; analy@@ sts believe that this should be achieved through the elimination of anonymous comments in sub@@ stitution within social networks . it is now un@@ clear how the authorities use these rules . &quot;
&quot; Chinese A@@ br@@ ush@@ ers proposed in social media , these regulations are only sel@@ ective to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence . &quot;
then we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ chat &quot; ?
