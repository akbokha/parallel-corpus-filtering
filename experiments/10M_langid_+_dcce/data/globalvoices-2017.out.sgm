<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year ago I would live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is exceptionally great.</seg>
<seg id="4">"as many of my generation I grew up with American films, American authors have read and operated its sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had a profound effect on me that I was mainly for a American film journalist."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as 14-year-years I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, which was made with the help of Julia Roberts as Jura-Studens of a oil stomach, which were the top Bundescourt with judges, who had his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free according to Method Man, 'me' s, as if the absolute truth is, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year that I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the US had only even stronger."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said," America is the only country where I ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be that you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I was even written a very swelling love about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the envishobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he goes with his bottoms.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain as one says so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks, like a former colleague, and explained publicly his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afroamericans and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people have responded to his statements and tuned it for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"13 million voices, which he won at the Republican pre-elections, was the highest number that presented one from the party nominee candidate."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans who support these bigsoons, asked me?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I was able to bring Trump and his voters do not associate with the people who I met while my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">"as for example my Professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of the journalist program, the people from all over the world takes on a deep breath, with whom I could talk about Islam and its past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Trumps cosmos not coincided with the by Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the" Cincinnati inquirer, "</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met us with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the "Phoenix Suns in the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trumps intolerance stands also in contrast to generosity that I lived at Sandy Bahr, who is fighting for her life for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"nor fits them to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped with a lot of patience and grace to me and my colleagues helped to get used to the complexity of the American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors who helped me a lot to me."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values are deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"during the Trump of his way to the nominal Republican presidential elections, they offered me a grip and the counterpiece to its limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016, over 50 million Americans were mostly female, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt compared to non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the examination of the idea that people have tuned for Trump because they shared either his racism and fanaticism, or because they were ready to overlook these things, broke me almost the heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair the bustle-voters as a cashier to call.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to arrange people, one of my friends, is exactly what has led us to that situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">"this is superficial and respectful, and indicates an inability to understand those who act in a different way."</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not considered.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters who are most white, for Trump, because they want to regain control over a country that she has disappointed?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might want to say that they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one cannot forget the words of David Remnick, which decides the cruel decision to raise a man who look with contempt for those who look differently from it."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" whitelash "(bm. &lt;.: much like" conditions of the White against all other ethes "; Wortting from white in reference to the White and Whiplash, which means that the big Van Jones has been called, exactly what America has been so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate American Ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background one can always have, America means every welcome."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country elected as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose history, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"but with the choice of Donald Trumps, there is a huge part of the white America's promise, and says: to hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11 the white man is again on the ruder, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"with all that I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldiers who has fallen in Iraq, and what he said at the eve of the choice."</seg>
<seg id="47">At a manifestation for Hillary Clinton had Mr. Khan exchange with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" "Mr. Khan."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the quantity replied with a" "strong" "no!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"would you have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" disrupture the amount.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos had a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" answer them. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" "they and their voices were destroyed."</seg>
<seg id="56">"would anyone who do not have such as you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a rainy and powerful "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan closed with the words:" "God be thanks, Mr. Trump, is that not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected. "</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land, for which his son was like, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now Trumps land, said the message."</seg>
<seg id="61">"and all the people, which look like Mr. Khan, could no place in this new America."</seg>

<seg id="100">"in West Africa that this ship was already known that this ship had already operated in liberal waters illegal fishing, before there was the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were above accordingly uplifted and little gended to welcome a lawful of this kind to their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilised itself rapidly against the ship. they are referenced to him, one of their ports and consecrated to him a fishing permit."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "Ursuddenly, the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply referring to Benedict Kiilu, a leidment of the Kenyan Fischereiregulatory authorities. he is part of a team who discovered the ship at time and followed."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch him there fish."</seg>
<seg id="105">"ultimately, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, because of plundering the fish stocks of the country."</seg>
<seg id="106">"at the core of this initiative, the criminal practices protects and resources, was Fish-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by NGOs (Illegale Fisheries (Illegale Fisheries)."</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are next to Somalia and Madagascar the six countries which had displaced the prime minister out of their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" with this we have eight countries which are like-minded people and work together. they exchange information and stand together with each other where it is about illegal fishing industry, "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts's project ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers Fish and technical support."</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is controlled by definition of unregulated: what is being caught, present, present, it is extremely difficult to maintain it. this is the illegal fishing in a main focus of overfishing regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"by the estimated disregard of existing laws, by means of which certain habitats and species are to be protected, can harm the illegal fishing ecosystems that have a delikates balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while action against illegal fishing once were disabled by bureaucratic hurdles, and also by the Schneckentempo, with the information between individual countries in real time, with traceable on Fish-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"there, the individual countries can share the individual countries with each other lists of existing licenses, updates to suspicious activities or details that one had noticed during a port speculator."</seg>
<seg id="113">"fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive, if they move on the open Sea by means of satellite."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to mark ships, which fishing in bothered areas. also let us discover that a ship suggests that a ship charges on other ships on the way."</seg>
<seg id="115">"in the Idealapse may give such studies whether the participating ships have a fishery-license where they were on the go, and possibly also whether they have a criminal offence."</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishery can be found on the basis of this information then the adoption of such ships in their ports. what means that the ships could not sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to the numbers of criminal offences as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it is then about significant financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing fishing is no longer worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"and that is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, director director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultant company dedicated to fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also Fish Coni."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already mentioned platform was created to gain 20 million USD in lost sales, which loses eight members of the network HISH-i every year due to the illegal fisherman who invading in East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">"East-Africa has one of the most productive tuna-fish species, present the region for commercial fishing from all over the world. among these also these illegal fishermen."</seg>
<seg id="122">"their practices include actions such as the sails under false flag, counterfeit licence papers, stresses of fantasy, the fish-protected species and the fish in nature areas."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" they are targeted the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a not completely organised control system, "says Long." "earlier a ship was illegal and a country could then say" "you don't want to walk my harbour."</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. 'and exactly this legale gpfloch tries to close Fish i.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its foundation, Fish was involved in more than 30 studies of suspected ships."</seg>
<seg id="127">It has criminal networks revealed to split the fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that have several fraudulent identities and found its fleeting ships have been pursued and found.</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its collaboration with Interpol, the international Authority on combating crime, fish can share information on illegal fishing over large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our studies lead us rather far into the networks of organised crime, "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">"he builds a system, the fish-i should help to perilateral ships accurate."</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo with friendly permission of Fish-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"Fish's satellite system, which is always further developed, also helps to hide the illegal ships that would like to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and position," "says Duncan Copeland, Chefanalyses at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO, who also deals with fisheries data and Fish-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships turn off for example their automatic identification systems, which they can no longer be cleaned by satellite."</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland helps to build a system that connects different information levels together. there is a fish-i help to find criminal ships with larger precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But Fish's team can actually influence the African nations in African nations without the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing industry?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has recently opened the Platform Global Fishing Watch: a platform that offers satellite channels and can be shown worldwide by means of the position of each traceable ship worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbors to get a better picture of what does it does - this gives us a sense," "says he." "here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources for investigation."</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this on a global level." "Pew Charitable Trusts has allowed a similar project in which a global system allows the persecution of ships permitted."</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that fish-i's activities are not only criminish but they also disfright.</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships, which used earlier without licence, and hardly expected with consequences, now they know that they are observed."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the participating in Fish-i participating countries have now set a 33% increase in fish stocks, since fishing boats more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after Fish-i Somalia had helped to have Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board towing networks, whose use is prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo with friendly permission of Fish-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice this successes." "the effect is so strong that we have now to copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "in West Africa disappear annually several hundred million dollars through illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"there are six countries assembled in 2015 to the so called West Africa Task Force. now, they now fight the illegal fishing, after exactly the same model such as Fish." "With security is the goal, even more such initiatives and structures can also be created in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, Fish's younger member of the Risland Somalia has been his first big triumph: in October it was Greko 1, a ship which was on the move on the wrong flag. and not only the ship was used without a license and were used to go by now."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also penetrated current waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the Take-rules against Greko 1 put the strong sign that they go against illegal fishing fishing." "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for Fish, this is another success of many. and at the same time proof that such a special, collaborative approach to protect the oceans actually works throughout the world Ocean.

<seg id="786">"for me this is, as if they have lost those who have lost someone and those who have fear that they too happens something."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories to mere numbers in a statistics.</seg>
<seg id="788">The ineness of the people is unbelievable for me when the death of six people and the disappearances can be justified by 43 students in a neighboring country that they were asugly.</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to talk that they remain from such tragedies when they are not stirring and silent.</seg>

<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported in short of a different initiative by Steven Bird, the imoverable blog. "</seg>
<seg id="1139">"however, the focus of TLS is not written on the written page but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of big cities."</seg>

<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">"the massageous of the languages of the world can be avoided, if we have cities to accept diversity - safe spaces where inhabitants are not forgotten who they are."</seg>

<seg id="1144">"in this format, historians introduce their story in their own language before and translate them in English."</seg>
<seg id="1145">"even if the participants have no professional storytellers, so they lead their devotion and their representation that the audiences are to be redeemed."</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>

<seg id="1198">Where have we decided?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What do we have given extreme convictions in this process?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web development for open source and digital activist has been in the custody syrischer government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015 Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military facility, to an unknown site."</seg>

<seg id="1207">"perhaps none of Basics cultural prototypes predicted as the work, which he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to reconstructed the ancient ruins of Palmyras."</seg>

<seg id="1291">"Facebook publishes the word" "Calar" "or both of the same level, as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of the hasslanguage in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"over the past few years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely dismisite connation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that most commonly used by Ultra-nationalists as Hassspeech against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in the effort to fight Hasslanguage in Myanmar, the company has a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"Kalar's may normally be associated with racism, but the word in itself is not automatically calls forth encassment."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also posts, in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts expressed himself for his use."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"moreover, there are several burial words with different meanings that have the same bookmarks as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, the stool is written on" "Kalar htaing ', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like' Kalar PAE '(spalterbse),' Kalar oat '(Kamel) or' calarkaar '(curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooker Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>

<seg id="1301">"however, he had wondered his friends on a spiritual way of whether she could know his back pain, by doing a word."</seg>
<seg id="1302">The sentence ku la - "healing" (ku) + the Frageword (la) on total - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different. "</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Hands is the opinion that they will reduce Hasslanguage radical nationalists, but also that Facebook analyses, however, before it all Posts Lösche, which will spread in the suspicion, racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Calar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filtered the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automation will not understand what you go to Facbeook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">"what it should do, the post is carefully to analyse and control it by taking the adjacent words."</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar PAE" (putties).</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good is that these dread nationalists spread, a rather good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">"now, it is time to justify its nationalism."</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action is able to send a strong signal to all the Hasslanguage, the efficiency of this strategy may not stop long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experience of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and Wechat have proven that the censorship of shutters often have a cattery - and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks will be easily to use a new word or alternative spelling of the Spanish word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author Aung Kaung Myat, such as Facebook began to delete his posts, when he wanted to tell his friends only that the word 'Calar' is known from the social network:"</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I was attentive to this new Directive on Facebook, I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to visit the Liken, post and parts of contents for 24 hours because the post" Facebook Community Standards is not relaxing. "</seg>

<seg id="1480">It tells about how these clubs have created a secure place for these women and they are simultaneously made at the same time at the bottom of the wall.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video, the Rohini showed in her discussion, handmade by women who do not call their husband to name."</seg>

<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married since 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of her husband over the lips," says Rohini Pahe, from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra, in the married women the name of her husband. "</seg>

<seg id="1508">"the husband called a woman called Rohini, and asked what ideas put them in the head: his wife could not stop his name."</seg>

<seg id="1514">Why only women need to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would bear the fascist red spot if he also died."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I heard so that to carry it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not completely heard this, but my, they are now in a better position to choose, even to carry it in some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we make a trip on each discussion."</seg>
<seg id="1520">"normally, we pack lunch and water and go out into the field."</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want to make the women make sure who could hear what they say," says it. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">"during the last few months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they dances, and talked about things that they had never had thought before."</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years now and I also have some things, for example how our identities are connected to our husband and never been so honest."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels good to tell certain things noisy, no matter how small they are occurring."</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion we have talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have carried only Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most of the thing is okay, but some wanted a salary curta, a wide shirt over a hose, wearing; they did not baptize."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after a lot of arguments and discussion about the advantages of their own clothes, morals connected with the Saris and much more, tasted Rohini their own pair of curtas (Oberhemden) into a discussion, so that the women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they now decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and raw ini is certain that they will be able to create it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"on the question, whether in the five months they have changed something for their first discussion, confirms the things slowly come into roles:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have so far taken little steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but heard then again to tell the name of her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, make it still, but only when they are alone, and no other family members are involved."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two they continue to say the name of her husband; only one or two women now bear interest in their forehead on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">Women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - just like the fond of more freedom of movement or their own clothes-choice - at the end of a hard to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"in order to give each other self confidence, they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explained:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"but this club, each of us gives us confidence that will change something."</seg>
<seg id="1542">"and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families, if every woman in the club goes home and told other people about what we talk and what we do."</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may appear stupid since Singapore is recognized on an independent state as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the judicial minister K. Shanmugam should be considered in Singapore as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York the Minister, that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore, because it was compared to Singapore with other countries."</seg>

<seg id="1696">"it became so vulgar, it had the resorting of a flight before the answering."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, eat country it is then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons were not very noble: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', given the contrary he appeared unweird undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"in contrast, he has defended the idea that Singapore has to be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, alike, which will permanently be guided by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratically.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"once one reaches the core point of the theme, the good old corders reached by the authoritarian feeders who give preach democrats, leaving the twisted logic, as it fits better to their power."</seg>

<seg id="1706">"when Singapore is not a country, but a city is, thus to what land belongs to our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I understand nothing."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"I would be very grateful if our werter K Shanmugam would take the effort to clarify this point, provided that he was highly paid to be part of the government of the city of Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"on the blog published his comment, he pointed out the reviews on the reviews that one should start to read the whole fellow-line of the conference to better understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore is a city and no land."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the co-ordinance.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"when he said that Singapore is more an" city "" be considered a country, "he explained why the elections in Singapore is so uncomplicated, even if we are happy with free and fair elections."</seg>

<seg id="2090">The jordan Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talked about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance. "</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smocht a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the photo was recorded by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib spends the bulk of his time in time; once he pointed out to his screen, time to his computer, and back to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"but what can be left, a cigarette between his fingers or his with nicotine beadecked lips."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives in the upper floor of his family house, which has been forced to them in 1967; in whom Israel had to forced his occupation of the West Bank and fledaibs family to flee from their village in Palestine in which they had lived as felahyeen (about: Farmer)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for now six years, Hdaib is a passionate majority confronted by the conservative majority, and their proven opinions on gender rollers, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapids."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, often relate to topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, but also calls the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues are not only possible in his hometown Amman relevance, but also in cities which range from Damascus in Syria to fully after Sanaa in Yemen."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with its 25 years, Hdaib sees itself as a man who is not restricted in his mind through limits and he may feel according to their own statement by people who suffer the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, the Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he did not open it openly against the US American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib believes that its sympathy for those who are trying to survive in war areas, irgened with his identity as" Palestinian refugees was born - so he was born, even if he was born in Jordan, and has never been in Palestine. "</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I do not think of my own living conditions so," stresses Hdaib. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" I think so, because I am a man, while in water soldered nescafé in two cups; it is the holy month of Ramadan; in that time it is intended for Muslims, from sunrise until sunset. "</seg>
<seg id="2105">The jordan law also predicted that the public consumption of food during the Ramadan illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand has a cup of coffee at a seness hot juntag little with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">Generally speaking the sakes are hot coffee and the vibrations of the Kent cigarette in the nose primarily of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially when you throws a look into the neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, one avoids easy to do basic things - how to drink the public during the Ramadan water - in order to land not in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Ministry of Jordaniens has said a performance of the band Mashrou'Leila. already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentarians to support the Islamic nucleansing Front - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front sangers Hamed Sinno, the cultural and traditional standards of the country contradictory and the main reason for the concert. "</seg>
<seg id="2112">"the Euro MPs and former Pressesprecherin the Islamic coalition DIMA Tahboub said in an interview with CNN, that the concert" straight "was cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the Sangers."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many claim also, the commitment of the band in matters like the Arabian spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world be more dangerous activism that represents the proven legitimacy of the authorized legitimacy of the whole region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, mashrou'Leila the jordan people as" "progressive supporters of human rights" "who continue to employ themselves" for an intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement is likely to be likely not simply seized rhetoric, but actually a clear determining reality in Jordan, which occurs in Hdaibs work clearly."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016 Hdaib traditional sexchternal men to Leibe, looking for his vision of the fate of Arabic women to educate sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of an obviously Dutch, unfamiliar woman, whose arms and legs are up to the corners of the canvas."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red lake; maybe the blood of the countless women who lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust them."</seg>
<seg id="2119">"over the past few years in Jordan, the number of 'honorary' were put in Jordan - the inofficial outside."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"Human Rights Watch, the number of remorale in 2016 reached their peak; however, the institutional infrastructure is missing to support the women who tried victims of murders or domestic violence to ensure appropriate manner."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law on the Crime, women, who are exposed to the danger of internal families in prison," and for their release is often a long-term bureaucratic effort and the guarantee from the family, that the woman is nothing to happen. "</seg>
<seg id="2122">"Hdaibs music is pleased to become great popularity and is known for it, also not against subjects back in his country long as a tabu gold."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denied that his work is politically, however, however, that he is his music that is full of explicit reference to sexuality, freedom and expression, do not separate from politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"I have entered politics," says he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">"in a song called" Edward Sa'ed "takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack."</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" "Lawla al 3aib" "and in" "Ghareeb" "is the focus on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the list of the songs, which are politically politically, can be continued."</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib published a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and any other is it too."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market, on which one can get in his words, what you want" - be it faith or nonsense, hetero- or homosexuality. "</seg>
<seg id="2133">"he noticed that hardly any one speaks in Jordan on the rights of gay and lesbian, and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals are still in high censored in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014 Hdaib led an interview for the popular jordan OnlineProgramme Roya to remember that his comments was turned out of the context, filmed and his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded to them without cuts, but was only a beaten version," says he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today Hdaib is open for the arabic LGBTQ + -Community and represents the opinion that intolerance does not cope with homosexuals not to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentioned Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, which still has remained in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asked: if Abu Nuwhat, who later work on behalf of the calibre, in the eighth century was open to homosexuality, why can Jordanson not?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the Hashemitic Kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are brought to silence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the jordan news service gave several former government members and members of the teacher's decision, with the reason, they could have expressed themselves out on comments in social media, which coincide with the deep in the country of proclaimed corruption."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of what is the concert Hdaibs, that is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to achieve a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him progress is a continuous gain and take-time Jordan, Mashrou'Leila now has given a performance, but the path of progress - so it looks Hdaib - is sure that these changes will take place from day to day in the heart of the jordan society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, even, from an Arab world without interventions from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he did not tolerate his work until Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of it, to experience."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region with the help of music, art and literature of genuine and basic openness of approximate - and not by bombs, streams and on artificial kind of democratic democracies. at least hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until that time, Hdaib will continue to pass over and therefore also resistance."</seg>

<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>

<seg id="2181">The following article is the processed version of the word "lovemaking steamer" which has released the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here in a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people who we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not even more important, people who feel like stolen, affection fights?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">"precisely this question went to the two young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga by the Foundation Bogotart and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation, and inspired it to the campaign Cartas por la Reconciliación (letters to reconciliation), the young people to do so."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only in Kurzeme of a historical event, and they wanted to contribute their part to their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian Government had concluded a peace agreement with the Guerillabewing FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), which forms the longues of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"international, the sign of peace treaty is as significant, that the Colombian President José Manuel Santos was received for its services in the Nobel Peace Prize."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"however, in front of the Kolumbianences, however, is a long way to be able to speak of real reconciliation, and of peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrilla warned that many years have been suspended in illegal camps, were exposed and round the clock their weapons in their lives, must now be integrated into life as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society, in turn, who had accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deepened hatred from Guerillakämpt, they have to record this now into their ranks and support them in building a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that young Colombia would like to close together and help integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And exactly that they did so: until now have thousands of young people written letters - love bottwins to former Guerillers in order to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The target of the campaign are 6900 Buns - one for each former guillers - which should be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the letter to reconciliation was born on the world-apples of the Nobel Peace Prize, who took place in February 2017 in Bogotá. there were Leonardo and Cristian the opportunity to speak short with Kailash Satyarthi which was awarded the Nobel Prize."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"explained that we love the people that we love, on Valentine's thousands of love letters, but those forgot that they need much necessary."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he tarpaulin, he told, he told his love to share his love with people who took the urgent promise."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"in this way the plan, letters full of hope and support for former fighters of FARC, who now have to find their place in society and have to build up a new life." "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history to a common story of peace."</seg>
<seg id="2199">"so far, in the context of the campaign were collected more than 2000 letters."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is present in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I have never thought that someone would give me</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN camp in the Caldono-Cauca region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation Bogotart traveled into the camp to give the letters personally. "</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC set themselves on how they had done it earlier to accept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they had no commands, but letters full of substitution of people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very movable moment for all involved." it's incredible how many different feelings can walk in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between, "told the policy-president Manuela Jiménez Avila later."</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a assistant of the governor of the Province of Valle del Cauca makes this unforgettable experience so: "</seg>
<seg id="2208">After we had passed the letters, led me a former fighter through the camp of the guerilla fighters. "</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" Cambuches "(a kind of hut, where the guardians live) I saw a guardianers that wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I had fear, to pass, because besides him on the bed was a MGL-Granatering, a fatal weapon in the village of the village."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"I spoke him anyway and asked:" "hello, what do they just said?" "I answered," "I ask for a letter that someone has written me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life he wrote me something so beautiful, that's why I suddenly met my tears about the cheeks."</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged it very well and set me in addition to the granting.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was compassion, was sorry to be all the years of fidelity endangered this fighter and he wanted to help him to write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he never had something different from life as war. the FARC was expecting him to preserve him, and his six brothers before the hunger strike." I had never imagined that anyone would forgive me for my mistakes. "</seg>
<seg id="2217">"but now I know that there is a society out there, which is waiting with open arms for us."</seg>
<seg id="2218">"until now, I have only learned how I have to deal with weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"for the prelude came students and some leaders of the FARC to a discussion, together."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown as already war and the FARC already worked in the twisted.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore the leaders of the FARC, the history of the organization, their ideals and gave an insight into their views on the peace process:" "many years now, we have experienced the social injustice on the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to contribute to a political party, we can contribute to the society in this country."</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a goal of these size, it is worth to overcome all obstacles," "said one of them."</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"these people have never heard, who have never heard yet to be heard and not recognise that people who have often seen as monsters and even hassen, even people with beautiful feelings, who were circumfertilted by their living conditions and their environment was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality, in which the country lives, does hurt me."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it tract me that all men - even those who have killed and so much damage, we can bring something to us and give a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of the town of Cali, the following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Kolumbians was prophesied that after the draining of peace would reign.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as it inequality, hunger and lack of education, health and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are willing to draw up arms and to protest their rights (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we from FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without arms."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"therefore, we call all defender of peace to - no matter which race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, because we know from their own experience that nothing is simple. those among us who defend life as the basis of existence, many difficulties are impending."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"on our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2300">"with their help I left the country, but then something unbelief."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought them, without writing without writing, without revealing, without everything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and cast them to the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came to and checkout into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message:" you do not think about, you are left in security, just because you left the country? "</seg>
<seg id="2309">"our people already know, in which hotel you do. you even know your room number."</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove to you: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine it?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was indeed my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: just with my mother and sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we do not talk about sexual performance, however, this is a cell issue."</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditionally Caucasian elements I still do in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So much I would also wish to overcome these seelic barriers I can not overcome.</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that, as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chatting with camera, I actually give me trouble such as the person who reminds themselves from their past - so on my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends know, those who have stayed dortas?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I have filed a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For the needed I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spake with someone who have spent a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during the Ramadan, no man was arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of the Ramadan could hardly wait, and he closed a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"with that I mean, they probably invite the relatives, they take care of the problem with the person affected and in the end, that the so-called" honor "through blood genugtuung has experienced."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are now still being arrested for pregnant men in these secrecy?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a known from me says there was not very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then above all such that have no rich relatives or have been abandoned by their relatives, to face Kinnrows."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"if I know, they will be arrested there, so that they can present them later as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say: should they be ument, one will show their bodies on television and claim, they could have been attacked either a village or a military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people would not simply disappear, but targeted interruped to radical."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is that now only a mutation or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I have just returned someone who was one of the one half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people disappeared in this prison after their beard grew.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new out of them.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply have put them into them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was himself as these people were taken."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"however, they were not introduced as bandits, so far there were no reports. we refused however, that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else you would have not allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"know if these persecutions and performances of people who belong to a so-called" non-traditional "orientation, already in the past?"</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always carried my hair for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I believe in 2003 I was already well known in Grosny when I lived there - and I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when the sharia was gold, I had never problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary then it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia wanted to lead us to the" "civilisation", "ultimately, has finally thrown back into the Stoneage."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Scharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were dimmed; I had colored eyelashes, carried Röhrenjeans and a short Tops. "</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Security Department of Scharia has never received a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in front of the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially at weekends, a whole group of people met with me."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew thereof; they knew why men, young people, there met."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been honoured.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a depot: Knowa ma Knowa. that is said: "Splice not about the unhappiness of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">You often say it often to children if that make himself funny about sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they just have their eyes closed before you, because they believed, you are sick."</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they have never been honoured, never before, and never beaten."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this mercy seat?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: as long as Kinnrov entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he became Prime Minister for Prime Minister, he started talking about morality on TV."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he does not speak about us per se, but predominantly over the behaviour of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel like the people in the city began to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Who had praised and liked to see you at once with Argilding.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel like the situation in the Republic has been steadily increasing."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what job do you go to?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as cellars.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't think much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the US are not much.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"from that, I am still active as activist."</seg>

<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: wear a Hiddenab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is Algerian.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"thus, nature, that has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Chechnya that wants to prophesy to you with foam in front of the mouth, that there is no swils with them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Daggers have which, the Cabardiner have which the Russians have also what the Russians are, but on the whole planet it is - but" not in Chechnya. "</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, that is why it is unpleasant, sowing."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I see here so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>

<seg id="2389">"know, many think during Transitional identity of men who love men, and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences. but this is a chest."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different types of sensation, to be accurate, different ways settings."</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry I'm sorry that I will be so personally but my last intime relationship is now more than one year ago.</seg>

<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments under the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I am not feminist that many women - especially white women, who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with freshness."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even set well through scientific and social arguments against me why I should be feminist and why we should generally be feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, women today still earn less money in spite of equal education than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observations if it is about what they can do with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women sooner or later in various fields of life to a glorious blanket, and that discrimination based on sex still attracts through the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced of it and I'm twice and triple.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"and yet, when I come to speak on skin colour, to racism, on black CIS women, on black CIS women, on black women in the LGBTI community, and on black women from the Diaspora, and on black women have been physically, both in and outside the feminist movement, they left many white feminists and white intersectional feminists."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"but still all women - all women - together should come together to raise their voices, and 'Kumbaya, my Lord" to sing "to reach the equality (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they do not want to talk about it, that in addition to sexualised violence is an institutionalized form racial violence, which we are exposed to black women on two-fold species."</seg>
<seg id="2450">"or on that black women and women of other ethics and country of origin, earn less than white men and women."</seg>
<seg id="2451">"that black girl and girls with a migration background of the school are referred to as white girl, due to obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spheres and women are exposed to a higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in partnership, as white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want to join all the women, all men and all men every man, but on the other hand, I cannot join the same rights; on the other hand, I am unable to consider myself as black woman who refuse to consider injustice in their mind that refers both to the gender and skin colour."</seg>
<seg id="2454">"I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging in a white-feministic environment, which me and countless other black women always has always rejected."</seg>
<seg id="2455">"sojourner bekled 1851 in her speech:" "I am not a woman?" "and I also deny myself to maintain an ideology, in which the black woman is in historical respect a disinfant and marginalized being."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refused to assemble me groupings, which also absorb our customs and customs, in order to advance your egoat program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try, white women gain the importance of survival of skin colour and gender. for some of them continue to remain the importance of black women for the feminist movement dead, no matter how many black women are trying to instruct them a better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although the intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different subjects to give a home and down from the white feminism, is still the word" feminism "in his name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I stand it before, to put me full of feminism and to close me to the movement of the Womanism that has been launched for my dark skin and my status as wife in life, rather than a non-feminist paradigm is being celebrated as a new phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">"now it is more important than ever, that we define black women to define our own ideas and enter into the spheres that we will be created for us."</seg>

<seg id="2463">"in a womanist environment, I can raise black women and women of other cultures, as in this paradigm, I have existed."</seg>

<seg id="2628">"this article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports on solvent possibilities for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton already worked in the US Salat for the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"his company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredgeous, the first plant that has been cultivated by NASA-astronaut in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years of Mortons work was only carried out by its own influences and the question, how many salads can get limits."</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s he had patented that more salads were patented and that he could not use them further on the breeder.</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents have not only been used for individual sorts, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years, more and more such patents have been signed up on more plants such as cereals and cartridges locations. due to these trends make a plant breeding, environmental protective and atomizer for food security for the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representatives of an millennia tradition borton still salad, he still needs more, since his work is getting more and more constrained."</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it is, as would be in a river a rock brocks, around which I have to gumped."</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we need to do this now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition, he says." I think that these patents go to salads too far. "</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand before judgment, then no one can move more a new salad, because all the characteristics are already patented. it thus makes as good as possible and tries to breed those features."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, he is very careful and strives to use any material that is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the USA and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("Open Source" -Breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">"astronauts at the International Space Station ISS have red red redundy in the" greenhouses "of the station bred and eaten. there will be tested, whether plants in space will be cultivated."</seg>

<seg id="2643">"it is not a coincidence that this name is rather so sounds, when the movement comes from the IT area, and not of the area of plant breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2644">"the Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for" Open-Source "" Saatwell) can be inspired by the movement for free "Open Source" "software inspire alternatives to copyrighted software."</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was launched to life, to ensure that some plant types and indigenous people are not protected as intellectual property and are permanently usable for plant breeders."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"within the framework of the initiative, briefly Ossi, you can commit US-breeder that others can use the seed of them."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do with their seed, and they can buy it." open source "</seg>

<seg id="2651">"according to him, it plays a role in larger compositions such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter, not or only little by using seeds with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasises that the "Open-Source" movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented whether vegetables, corrosion, modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not." to purchase our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seed company, which is offered in August or September 2016, how it is offered on peasant markets, it should also know that the way it is bred in August and September 2016.

<seg id="2654">Nutritionality without Saatbenign is not possible.</seg>

<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, Executive director of Ossi, has worked in their doctoral work with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. it found out that roughly one third of all cartography are protected as intellectual property as an intellectual property, either not or only compelling."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants there are such estimates yet, but experts like Luby vermute that massaged plants like wheat are patented as salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants will be so bred that they make them targeted characteristics - from such, through which their taste or colour enhances up to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments, and threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of cartridges on plant characteristics point out that the available plant material for breeders are due to increasingly more patents. genetic diversity is currently necessary than ever since the changing conditions due to climate change is much worse.</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an email, Monsanto-Speaker Carly Scaduto that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Monsantos activities. with a total of four commodities and cooperation with institutions such as the agricultural Ministry of the United States."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"they however, however, however, however, the view that spiritual property holds other breeders, as" patents and the protection of plant varietals innovations. "" a patent is essentially a plan that can follow each one as soon as the patent is expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">"often, these instructions helps others to come with another method for the same result."</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection is not as innovations, but promotes them by providing the public more material and know-how."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees the other: 20 years to wait, until a patent discontinued, stretcher certainly no innovations."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you are waiting for so long to wait to crops, which are adapted to the modified environmental conditions, one could have lost the struggle already."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"the main rubberent for Morton is however that genetic resources have always been a common good and they should continue to remain:" "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor money for such formalities, and monary incentives are not attractive for us."</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us, and it will be impossible if we do not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"in a total of disturbing Morton is structured on the concept to patenting, plant characteristics:" we do not create the characteristics of itself. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">"the plants make them out of and as breeders, we finally have no idea how the plants do this."</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the US-state Oregon and Ossi committee member, there is still another important aspect of plant breeding:" who also bred his own values in it. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"who believes in industrial agriculture with great courtyards and monocultures, for their cultivation of massageous herbicides in his varieties of farming."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is exactly entangled. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such that have to move on international markets, but small as Monsanto are) patents, make it the most smaller seed company, even without patents - either reject it or hold it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case."</seg>

<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the executive committee of the European Union, the European Commission, declares that conventional plants should not be patented. thus, it speaks to the present practice of the European patent market, which allows patents on conventional plants."</seg>
