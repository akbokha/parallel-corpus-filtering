this is James Ris@@ en .
they might know him perhaps because he won as a New York Times Re@@ porter the Pul@@ itzer Prize .
&quot; long before the one of Edward Snow@@ den had heard , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he spectacular that the N@@ SA illegal teleph@@ ones of Americans have heard . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
therein he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US secret cooperation in which the CIA was transferred to Iran in favour of an atom@@ ic bom@@ b .
&quot; if the crazy sounds , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
&quot; but do you know , whom the chapters not changed ? &quot;
the U.S. Government .
&quot; for nearly 10 years , the government has been established against Ris@@ en and asked him to name his grown sources . &quot;
&quot; in this train it became a symbol for the pattern of the government , wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers and journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the first constitutional , the media have the right to publish good information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right , if media cannot get this information and if it cannot protect the identity of the Mu@@ d that they are inexpensive . &quot;
&quot; so when the government came with cr@@ acks , he did something that many cour@@ age@@ ous repor@@ ters already did before him , and said that he would prefer to go into prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived closely with the risk to go to prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , only days before the process , something something exceptional . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although they have years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government have been abandoned . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the Re@@ porter and sources can always hide less .
&quot; instead of fail and cr@@ acks to the statements , this could also take his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so shall the Medi@@ ator , without his permission , his calls for a secret , &quot;
&quot; just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , its credit card , and even fri@@ ght@@ ened with the list of his flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condem@@ n J@@ eff@@ rey Ster@@ ling , a CIA @-@ W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lowers and cr@@ ens ver@@ so . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama spoke at his arrival , W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lowers . but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary has more condem@@ ned than all US governments before him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government is too much of their work than secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of that a wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers went to a journ@@ alist . &quot;
&quot; thus we put the press work on the game , which should be protected by the first constitutional , because the government has more possibilities to hide all . &quot;
&quot; but just as the technology of the government allows the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; while they are able to contact them from the moment , in which they contact us instead of into it , in the witness . &quot;
&quot; today there are communication software that there was not yet , as Ris@@ en his book had written and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ drop , an open source @-@ source system for W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lowers , which was originally developed by the Internet of Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is today developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , at which I work , further developed . &quot;
&quot; instead of send an e @-@ mail , go to a news website , just like the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send information , as in any common contact form . &quot;
&quot; this will be encryp@@ ted and stored on a server , to which only the respective news agency has access . &quot;
&quot; so , the government can no longer blame the government and many of the information they would require , would not be available from previous . &quot;
but Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are always developing new esp@@ ion@@ et@@ echn@@ ologies that are all endanger@@ ed us with us . &quot;
&quot; it is to ensure that not only technique den@@ omin@@ ator like Edward Snow@@ den have a way to carry out mis@@ de@@ eds . it is just as important that we protect the next W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lowers , &quot;
&quot; the talks about mis@@ ses in the supply of soldiers hum@@ ble knows and by floo@@ ded hospitals . or the next environmental representative , the alarm on the se@@ ated water of F@@ lin@@ t propos@@ es . or a Wall@@ street Insider , which war@@ ned us before the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thanks .
&quot; &#91; on 3 April 2016 , the biggest dat@@ l@@ ery of the story was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama papers &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; we b@@ aten Robert Pal@@ mer from Global Wit@@ ness to an explanation . &#93; this week we were called messages about a l@@ ender of 11 million documents of in Panama . &quot;
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; we receive an impression of how customers , banks and Law@@ yers to companies such as Mos@@ o Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you create it ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Iceland Prime Minister has occurred .
&quot; also , there are reports that an allies of bru@@ tal dict@@ ator B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Assad brief@@ ing companies in tax hav@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; it is claimed that a gap of 2 billion US dollars to Russia President Vladimir Putin introduces about a narrow friend from children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people , and others give the nervous to the next publication , and to the next un@@ v@@ eil@@ ed documents . &quot;
now that sounds like the P@@ lot of an agency gr@@ illed or a John @-@ Gr@@ ish@@ am @-@ chair .
&quot; it seems w@@ ept away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we achieve that ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and mighty in the position are to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens and do not pay all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and that affects us all .
&quot; for my organisation , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenomen@@ al . &quot;
&quot; throughout the world we discuss the media and leading politicians , such as a secret tax hav@@ ens of some few to be utili@@ zed , their assets to hide and merge -- something that we have been discussing and un@@ cover for ten years . &quot;
I think many people appears quite conf@@ using this whole world and it is hard to understand how these tax hav@@ ens work .
I always imagine it like a sail@@ ors .
&quot; so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these prayers . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for criminal enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really understand what matters is . &quot;
I find it interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the USA .
&quot; pres@@ um@@ ably because it has not been a prominent American so far in these revel@@ ations , this sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; now , it is not so that there are no rich Americans that hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; but through the principle , after which this tax hav@@ ens work , Mos@@ bag Fon@@ sec@@ a fewer American customers . &quot;
&quot; we would have a data sheet of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have much more cases and examples which have connections to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that in some US states less information needs to provide less information to create a company than to get a libr@@ arian card . &quot;
&quot; this type of inf@@ lic@@ ence in the US has allowed the employees of school places , school children . &quot;
it has allowed frau@@ ds to prevent especially an@@ cho@@ di@@ ous investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
&quot; so , we sent a covered investig@@ ators to the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan . &quot;
&quot; our investig@@ ators gave himself as African ministers , who wanted to bring some money into the USA to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
we really shock@@ ed it really that all the up to an attorney made our invent@@ ory suggestions as he could transfer its money .
&quot; these were all pre@@ domin@@ ations . none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course nobody was handed over to money . however , it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important to consider this not as a single accidents .
&quot; it is not about a single fire , which has under@@ lined the printed proposals . &quot;
&quot; it is not about a single top @-@ police , wr@@ apped in a sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and to cope with this , we must change the rules . &quot;
we must change the rules to create this kind of behavior .
&quot; this may sound all very tr@@ endy , as if we could not do anything against it ; as if nothing could be changed , as if there is always the rich and mighty . &quot;
but as well @-@ born optim@@ ist I see that a lot to change has started .
&quot; over the past few years , we have seen a bre@@ aches to more transparency , which affects the owners of companies . &quot;
&quot; the topic found political attention by the British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 Summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland . &quot;
&quot; since then , the EU has captured in central regi@@ sters at the national level , who is really behind firms in Europe and who is controlled . &quot;
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the USA remains behind .
&quot; representatives of both parties have brought a legislative activity in both parliament@@ arians , but this does not make progress that we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
&quot; we need ordinary people who are angry , when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ aches . &quot;
we need execu@@ tives in the economy which stand and say : &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for the business . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it by laws this kind of in@@ consistency . &quot;
&quot; together we can finally termin@@ ate the in@@ consistency , which now allows you to end this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; this is the story , as I am almost kid@@ n@@ apped and in the boot of a red Maz@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; one day after I had completed my design program , I made a back@@ yard . &quot;
a guy in the red ma@@ z@@ da remained and looked my things .
he bought one of my artwork .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip throughout the country . after that he would go to the peace trip .
I invited him on a beer . he told me excited how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him , &quot; where sh@@ ouldn &apos;t you think that night ? &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I do not know it yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought : &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what am I now ? &quot;
who does the situation do not know ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him just ! he says he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he is really plans . I don &apos;t want to end in the comp@@ artment of a ma@@ iden ! &quot;
this is a small suit@@ case !
then I heard myself : &quot; I have a bub@@ bles . you can sleep in my living room .
&quot; one voice in my head said , &quot; uh , how please ? &quot;
&quot; night I was in bed , I thre@@ w up on the blan@@ ket and thought : &quot; Oh Mann ! what did I get out of it here ? &quot;
a wilderness of the sleeps in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I got out of the bed , on t@@ aps at the door , and my sleeping corner door closed . &quot;
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
the artwork that he bought from me depends today in his class@@ room . he is now teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my point of view .
&quot; maybe people were sold to me in childhood as stran@@ gers , actually friends who only expected to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; people on my air@@ mat@@ rat@@ ze hosts , was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air@@ mat@@ rat@@ ze . &quot;
let &apos;s take a moment in two years later ...
&quot; I am un@@ employed , almost pl@@ ast@@ ness , my room@@ mate moves out and the rent is raised . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in town . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can make it to be afraid of fun .
&quot; I wrote my best friend and new fellow @-@ mates Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I talked about how we could earn something . our apartment will be able to make a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , including a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
ha !
we set up a website and scre@@ ened so &quot; air@@ mat@@ rat@@ ze and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ cal@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep at home for 20 dollars on the air@@ mat@@ rat@@ ze on wood@@ work floor .
they found it super and we too .
&quot; I am sure , our cheese @-@ ham @-@ o@@ mel@@ et tast@@ ed completely different because we made them for our guests . &quot;
we walk with them through the whole city . when we met our last guest and the door came into the castle coinci@@ ded Brian and I am .
&quot; we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time , and you could pay our rent ? &quot;
things came into roles .
&quot; my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , closed ourselves as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out whether you could make a business concept .
&quot; we presented our investors : &quot; we want to create a website , on the people publicly make pictures of their private rooms , their bathrooms , their bathrooms -- the type of rooms , whose doors can be closed when you visit . &quot;
&quot; over the Internet , they can then invite people to invite people to stay with them . &quot;
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we wa@@ ited that the ro@@ cket would be closed .
indeed they do not .
&quot; nobody , who is still very close to Tro@@ st , would invest in a business , the stran@@ gers allowed to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we have lear@@ nt as children all that stran@@ gers are dangerous .
&quot; if one has an issue , you can remember the things that you can well . we could be designated . &quot;
&quot; at the Kunst@@ ak@@ ademie , we learned that design much more than just looks and H@@ ap@@ tik -- it is the overall experience . &quot;
&quot; we learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who had never met before . &quot;
can design such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
&quot; I would like to give you an incen@@ tive , which degree can trust us . &quot;
it is a 30 @-@ seconds experim@@ ent . it will force you out of your comfort .
thum@@ bs high when you are ready .
take your phone into the hand .
&quot; now , I would like to un@@ lock your mobile phone . &quot;
type your correspon@@ ded mobile phone to your left seat .
&quot; this quiet@@ ness of panic , which you now feel -- -- is exactly what the hosts can be felt if it was the first time opening the door . &quot;
&quot; for the only thing , which is even more personal than your mobile phone is your home . &quot;
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS text , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to hold the phone of a stran@@ ger in the hands ?
most of them feel the responsibility .
&quot; so , most of the guests feel , if they are staying there . &quot;
only for this reason our company can exist .
&quot; only once , who is now Al Gor@@ es &apos;s cell phone ? &quot;
could you pro@@ claim on Twitter that he will be used for the office of the President ?
you can now enter the manual now .
you now have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build . I want to tell you some discover@@ ies .
what would be changed when we had changed a little detail about this experim@@ ent ?
&quot; what if your neigh@@ bor would have been presented only once with his name ; if he would have told what he comes , how his dog or his children will be called ? &quot;
&quot; imagine you would have 150 covers , which all say : &quot; he can truly consoli@@ date the wr@@ ys ! &quot;
how would you feel when you would have to give your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ concei@@ ved feedback system strength@@ ens the trust decisive .
in the beginning we still had some things wrong .
it was hard for people to give negative mort@@ als .
&quot; finally , we decided to wait until both host and guest had given their suppor@@ ters before we set them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we have conducted a study with Stan@@ ford &apos;s study . we examined how probably it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are in terms of age and residence . &quot;
little surprising we trust the people most that are the most res@@ um@@ ing .
&quot; the more differences we find , the less confidence we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social demonstration .
exciting will be exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case with complaints .
if you have less than three covers , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but one has more than ten , changes everything . &quot;
a good call sti@@ pul@@ led common simil@@ arities .
so the right design can thus help us to overcome some of our deeply root@@ ed preferences .
&quot; moreover , we experienced that trust is dependent upon how much you can . &quot;
here you can see the responses to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you tell too little about how for example &quot; Hi ! &quot; , you do not get an answer . &quot;
&quot; he tells us a lot , as for example : &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother -- &quot; -- &quot; &quot; the request is also not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; &quot; great art@@ works in your apartment ! I do with my family vacation . &quot;
how can I create it with design to create this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics you should write something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces compared to stran@@ gers . &quot;
&quot; what we did not reck@@ oned , was the great amount of people who were more than ready to settle these pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
here you can see how many people are entitled to use our offer .
you can recognize three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
&quot; thir@@ dly , a need , which was not covered before . &quot;
for us the business has just been very good .
of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who are un@@ allowed parties celebrated or rented apartments .
hosts have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front front when trust was broken .
there is nothing Sch@@ lim@@ mer@@ es than this calls . it does already hurt when I think only .
&quot; the disappointment that can be heard in the voice of the sight , and will also be our greatest motivation to improve . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , of the 123 million people had only a fr@@ action than a problem . &quot;
for people familiar with one another .
&quot; if trust works , it can create wonder@@ land . &quot;
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . there was also a heart attack .
his host drove him into the hospital .
he even don@@ ated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his ass@@ essing :
&quot; perfect house for travellers , which is circum@@ cis@@ ed because of sitting operations to heart attack . &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with ample hospitals .
&quot; Javier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real prot@@ ections that save one life , even though they do not have to know one at all . &quot;
&quot; they drive one in your own car into hospital , if you die , and wait , while you get a b@@ yp@@ ass . &quot;
&quot; because they do not want to feel lon@@ ely , they bring books past . &quot;
they can even stay longer without charge the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course it does not run every stay .
but these relations behind the pure money @-@ action are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy .
&quot; when I first asked about this term , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions together ?
it is about an economic trade .
&quot; but it is now simply to call &quot; &quot; le@@ ase &quot; to name &quot; &quot; the thing is not righte@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; share Economy describes a trade , human relationships promises . &quot;
people put a part of themselves open and that changes everything .
&quot; if one gets today , that is fast food to compare . it is efficient and reliable , but for this less authentic . &quot;
but what would travel be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
&quot; what would be when at any place you visited , a group there would wait , to complete a thorough and one in a pub @-@ tour quarters of which one has never heard before . &quot;
or if you could learn C@@ oo@@ king of a five @-@ star cook ?
&quot; nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we would like to share apartments from the ground ?
how would this look like ?
what would be the thoughts of shared thoughts of shared shared people ?
I imagine cities that enable us to society and relationships instead of lon@@ eliness and fr@@ ot@@ ation .
&quot; in South Korean capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces , which was owned by the government , &quot;
were offered to residence . students who were looking for a stri@@ kes were
were alleg@@ ed to people whose children were educated and were started .
&quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share economy . about our platform alone , more than 1,000 people in 191 countries will be a guest at a stran@@ ger or even hosts . &quot;
&quot; so the idea seems to be not so crazy , as it was brought us . &quot;
we have not re@@ inv@@ ented the wheel .
hospitality there were also before .
there were already similar sites before us .
so why has just our work ?
&quot; apart from luck and timing , we know that you can find the right design with the components of the trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deeply root@@ ed pre@@ judi@@ ces .
I find it amazing !
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it when a rot@@ er Maz@@ da goes over to me .
&quot; of course , we know that design cannot solve any problem . &quot;
&quot; but if it could help us when it had this great influence , I ask myself what we can use design soon . &quot;
thanks .
what do you think when you watch me ?
a believ@@ ing ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or supp@@ res@@ sed , a brain @-@ la@@ under@@ ing , a terror@@ ist attack ? &quot;
or simply a delay at the security rate at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you blame for your negative impressions .
&quot; thus , the media people represent , which look like me . &quot;
a study revealed that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : the Americans mean that most would have no Muslims .
&quot; pres@@ um@@ ably , people do not speak to their U@@ ber drivers . &quot;
&quot; for all those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great , you meet . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee owner -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra . &quot;
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ;
a car@@ rot @-@ Fitness @-@ fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in , &quot;
&quot; and I am a practic@@ ing , spiritual Muslims . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga Sing@@ ing , because , Baby , I was not so born . &quot;
I decided to have decided .
&quot; when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to ou@@ ched myself . &quot;
&quot; no , not as hom@@ os@@ exual man , as some of my friends , but as Muslim . I decided to wear hi@@ j@@ ab , my head coverage . &quot;
&quot; my femin@@ ist friend@@ ships were in@@ breeding , &quot; &quot; why do you oppressed yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the funny was , at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , and in contrast to the pressure that I felt as 17 @-@ year old , to adapt myself to a perfect and infinite beauty deal . &quot;
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents only .
I have been with the Quran .
&quot; I read him , thought after , presented in question , doub@@ ted and believed eventually . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was confident and slow dedication to deep@@ en with each reading of the cor@@ ans .
the beauty of rhyth@@ m@@ k brings me sometimes to the wines .
I know myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; had you ever feeling that someone you percei@@ ving , you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ? &quot;
this is how it feels .
&quot; later I married and began , like all the good Egyp@@ tians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; I had later , after my wedding , a child , and lived basically the &quot; Egyptian American dream . &quot;
then that terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had dinner at the end , looked upon the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking News . &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , air@@ planes in buildings , people sp@@ ran@@ ged from the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned quickly into emp@@ owerment .
why should you do so something ?
&quot; I joined the television can@@ al and heard : ... &quot; mus@@ lim@@ ical terrorists ... &quot; , &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; , &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ji@@ had ... &quot; , &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bed M@@ ec@@ ca ! &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it has not only been attacked my country , but in the N@@ u related to the acts of others from a civil war in a sus@@ pic@@ ious . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and begin with the integration process . &quot;
&quot; I remember how I drove me -- when we were wel@@ ded -- so deeply it went to my seat , and I was afraid to be recognized as Muslims . &quot;
&quot; we moved to our apartment in our apartment , in a new city , in which it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then heard , saw and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations that bes@@ ieg@@ ed : &quot; be watch@@ ful , &quot; &quot; Sei@@ d carefully &quot; , &quot; lead in well illumin@@ ated areas , &quot; &quot; ench@@ anted you not . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then it became Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims are gathered together .
&quot; and again the war@@ nings : &quot; does not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage of the coverage .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ able , and I heard of attack on Muslims or of people who held for Muslims , into the Free and proposed . &quot;
there was really bran@@ dies on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something felt not really felt right .
&quot; because people who had attacked this country , our country attacked . &quot;
I have rejected the rage of the people to the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to explain themselves and@@ au@@ ern@@ d itself .
I have nothing against questions I love questions .
&quot; there are the ap@@ ologies , which are hard . &quot;
nowadays we can actually say people to say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims .
when will we go on ? &quot;
some people want Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they talk about my church as of a tum@@ or in the body of the USA .
it is only the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tum@@ or as a whole and a ben@@ ign tum@@ or is only holding observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims are , like all the other Americans , no tum@@ or in the body of the USA , but a vital organ . &quot;
thanks !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , Er@@ sth@@ el@@ fer and Olympi@@ ans . &quot;
will then make the closing of mos@@ ques of America more secure ?
&quot; there will be maybe a few parking free , but not stop terror . &quot;
&quot; the regular visit of a mosque is leading to view people of other faith , and show greater citizen participation . &quot;
&quot; and how did a head of the police in the area of Washington , DC recently re@@ counted : people are actually not radic@@ alised . &quot;
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed before a computer .
&quot; in the radic@@ alization process , one has noticed that he goes online . as a first , the person believes in their church , even from their family , so that the person believes that terrorists are the true Muslims , and everyone who dism@@ iss their behaviour and ideology , is an off@@ set or from believ@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radi@@ k@@ alization , we must keep the people to go to the mosque . &quot;
some are still aff@@ irm that Islam is a non @-@ violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS its bru@@ t@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as Muslim , as a mother , as a person , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
&quot; but we would add to their preferences , if you acknowledge them as Represent@@ atives of 1,6 billion believers . &quot;
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam like K@@ u @-@ K@@ JV @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups maintain their ideology reasons in their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; but if you thro@@ wing a look at it , she don &apos;t drives them what they are in their &quot; Holy Scrip@@ tures . &quot; &quot;
it is their bru@@ t@@ ality that can read these things into the scrip@@ tures .
an outstanding I@@ mam was recently told me an amazing story :
&quot; a girl came to him , because she would have imag@@ ined to join the IS . &quot;
I was really surprised and asked him if they were in contact with radi@@ cal religious leaders .
&quot; he said , the problem was exactly the opposite . every spiritual , with whom they talked , she brought her wr@@ ath , and told her to her wr@@ ath , her sense of the inj@@ ustice in the world , they only would be in trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that had given her anger meaning , she was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization by extrem@@ ists who gave her a solution . &quot;
this I@@ mam brought the connection to God and their church again .
&quot; instead of embarrass@@ ing them for their anger , he showed her constructive way for real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what they learned in the mosque , keeping them before the IS . &quot;
it was an insight into how the Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia me and my family concerns .
but how does it affect regular Americans ?
how does it affect each other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affects our democracy ?
&quot; a study -- actually show multiple neuro@@ scientific studies -- show , when we fear , happen at least three things . &quot;
we rather accept a author@@ it@@ arian government system , conformity and pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; a study reveals : if you have read reviews messages in which negative about Muslims have been reported , they were rather military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circum@@ cis@@ ion of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; if you have a look at when the mood against Muslims from 2001 and 2013 -- then this three times , but never happened in connection with terror@@ ist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the occurr@@ ence of the I@@ rak@@ war and during two choices .
&quot; so , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not just the natural reaction to Mos@@ lem terror , as I expected it . &quot;
&quot; it can actually be a tool for manip@@ ulation of the public to maintain the foundation of a free society , the rational and well informed citizens . &quot;
the dealing with Muslims is an early mor@@ em@@ blem .
&quot; we might feel it as the first , but the tox@@ ic air of fear harm us all . &quot;
&quot; in the assignment of coll@@ ecti@@ vi@@ sts , it is not just about to explain himself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple , which lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a ath@@ l@@ ete .
&quot; he was at the dental fac@@ ulty , talented , much promise ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would say to me that he was the sweet , solid person who knew them . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was aston@@ ished and said :
&quot; when is of my br@@ other@@ , such a sealed young man become ? &quot;
&quot; only a couple of weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne at her brother and his wife , she mur@@ dered , Cra@@ ig Stephen H@@ icks , she was mur@@ dered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an who was in the afternoon , as with an exec@@ uting , after it had utter@@ ances against Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot;
he sent eight times to De@@ ah .
Fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be in@@ mor@@ ally but also dead@@ ly .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
are we made at the mosque or remained safe at home ?
&quot; we find it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about that America we want to leave our children : one that would be able to control our children , or one where we can freely ex@@ ert our religion . &quot;
we decided for the mosque .
&quot; with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we drove to the mosque to the mosque . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , my shoes went out , went into the command@@ ments , and what I saw , let me remember . &quot;
the hall was rest@@ less filled .
&quot; then the I@@ mam is an announcement , and it was our guests welcome , because half of the gathered together were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hist@@ s , A@@ thei@@ sts , believers , believ@@ ing and non @-@ bel@@ i@@ ever , who came to us to attack , but to contact us . &quot;
in that moment I have broken down .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion panic and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose for the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be sure to walk ?
or you will join those who are my : we are better than that .
thanks .
thanks nice !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have made a ner@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; but I wonder what do you say that you might maintain a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a mind@@ set in with deep @-@ dr@@ aught are , so an exception and not the rule are . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say that don &apos;t f@@ ool . I am completely normal .
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; if you look to Muslims around the world , and I did that with the largest of the study carried out throughout the world , people want normal things . &quot;
they want prosperity for the family who want to work and they want to live in peace .
so I am not an exception in any way .
&quot; if people seem like an exception to rule , then usually the rule has been broken ; and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
HW : thank you very much . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; what began as a platform for Bast@@ ler , it is short before , a milli@@ ard &apos;s business . &quot;
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial drug . possible , this is possible in research institutes worldwide . &quot;
&quot; before air @-@ par@@ cel creation in our social consciousness , an autonom@@ ous fleet of aircraft in FR@@ AC Centre in France live with audience a six meter high tower from 1 500 bri@@ cks . a few years ago she began to fly with arrows . &quot;
by connecting aircraft high speed and acceler@@ ation on a small space .
you can also build independently @-@ loaded structures .
&quot; they have learned to carry loads , to deal with turbul@@ ence and generally respond to natural laws . &quot;
today we want to present you a few of our new projects .
&quot; our goal is to cross the borders of the potential in the autonom@@ ous flight . &quot;
&quot; with it a system self @-@ sufficient , it has to know coll@@ ectively , where in the space there are the mobile objects . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at ETH Zürich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tas@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s dem@@ os , we use a new loc@@ alisation of Ver@@ ity studios , a boom of our laboratories . &quot;
there is no external cameras .
any aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the space and determine what the machine should do .
&quot; external commands is available at the highest hand . for example &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so@@ h@@ ann@@ ter rear starter , &quot;
&quot; an aircraft , which tries to beat two frames with a fl@@ ap . &quot;
&quot; like other Star@@ r@@ ins@@ ers is efficient , much more efficient than heli@@ cop@@ ters in all its variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most star@@ ters , it can fluctu@@ ate , and has therefore great advantages in starting and land@@ ing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a box . &quot;
a restriction of h@@ edge @-@ star@@ ters is that they were sensitive to turbul@@ ence such as wind bri@@ cks .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the air@@ plane no matter what location can be re@@ covered the optimum position and can be improved by exercise .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often provide basic abstract issues related to the core of the matter . &quot;
such a question would be for example : what is the petty @-@ possible number of mov@@ able parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question .
heli@@ copter are known about as machines with a thousand mov@@ able parts that meet you to hurt .
&quot; in recent decades a trained pil@@ ots could fly , the only two mov@@ able parts had : a prop@@ eller and a h@@ edge . &quot;
&quot; un@@ long discovered , we discovered that flying with just one works . &quot;
&quot; this is the mon@@ o@@ sp@@ inner , the mechanical fast @-@ deser@@ ved aircraft . it was recently inv@@ ented . &quot;
&quot; it has only a mov@@ able part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no cl@@ amps , hing@@ es and cross @-@ sides , no further actu@@ ator or Controll@@ ers , only a prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , it happens in interior living very much , so that it can fly stable and move in the room . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorith@@ m of the rear @-@ star@@ ters . to bring it to the catch , I must just throw it right . &quot;
&quot; the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood , it is exactly right to throw it is low , therefore I will show you a video that was fil@@ med yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; when the mon@@ o@@ sp@@ inner is an exercise in gen@@ oci@@ al@@ ity , this machine is here , the Omni@@ bus with its eight prop@@ ell@@ ers , a exercise in abundance . &quot;
what do with all this transmission ?
they see that he is only symmet@@ rical .
therefore he is ambi@@ valent in his orientation .
&quot; thus , he receives the ordinary ability , &quot;
&quot; to move in space in all directions , no matter what direction he is fil@@ med or even how it rot@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ell@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; some is un@@ imagin@@ able in models , the rest will be reserved directly at the catch . &quot;
let &apos;s see this in .
&quot; if you want to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine is composed of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller air machines .
this turns in clo@@ ck@@ wise
and the other against the clo@@ ck@@ wise .
&quot; if you build them , they beh@@ ave like a high @-@ performance socket . &quot;
&quot; however , something wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or battery -- the machine can continue to fly . &quot;
we will now demonstrate that we make up half an air@@ plane .
the last demonstration studied synthe@@ tic dy@@ ards .
&quot; the large number of autonom@@ ous , coordinated units enables a range of a@@ esthetic expression . &quot;
we participated in negoti@@ able micro @-@ Quad@@ copter -- every single weighs less than a washer of bread -- and sent them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
every unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine as dr@@ practic@@ ing wants to become a well @-@ mounted lamp@@ shade .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to predic@@ t the influence of these technology . &quot;
for types like us the sal@@ ary lies in the development and creative work .
&quot; it serves as a memory , as wonderful and ench@@ ant to our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures which allows them to form such a spectacular way . &quot;
&quot; the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential , the icing on the cake is on the cake . &quot;
thanks .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , in a very far distant galax@@ ies two black holes are getting faster , you walked as the mass of brass in a t@@ enth @-@ day of pure energy . &quot;
this short moment they bright@@ ly illumin@@ ated them as all stars together in all galax@@ ies of the entire us @-@ known universe .
it was a very big bang .
but your energy put them in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was ab@@ sent to the space @-@ time feelings themselves and the universe explo@@ ded in Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we arrange the events at first time .
1.3 billion years ago was a multi @-@ line life on Earth .
&quot; since then , the earth has led some things : cor@@ als , fish , plants , Sau@@ rier , people and -- God stand for us at -- even the Internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago a group especially mu@@ til@@ t -- R@@ ai Weiss from M@@ IT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver to build up a huge laser det@@ ector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational black holes . &quot;
most of them stopped for crazy .
&quot; but enough people welcome them as crazy gen@@ ius , so that the US National Science Foundation has been financing their idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades of development , construction , design and extremely much hard work they built the det@@ ector LI@@ GO : the laser @-@ Inter@@ fer@@ om@@ eter@@ - Gra@@ vit@@ ational observ@@ atory observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the following time , the precision of LI@@ GO could be increased considerably , what the output performance was increased enorm@@ ously . &quot;
therefore it is called Advanced LI@@ GO .
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , LI@@ GO was started for a last trial to clari@@ fy some smaller , hard @-@ no@@ dul@@ ent problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the det@@ ector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational of the two coloni@@ zation black holes through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott Hug@@ hes : just two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the far@@ ewell of my to@@ d@@ anz@@ ken father .
basically this was the fruits of my life .
all that which I had worked is no longer science Fic@@ tion ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hug@@ hes , theoretical physi@@ c@@ ist from black holes and their by observ@@ at@@ ories like LI@@ GO meas@@ urable signals . what are gra@@ vit@@ ational signals ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational thres@@ hold is a cr@@ acking in the feeling of space and time .
when temporary the wave will stretch the space and its entire content into a direction and put into the other .
to minim@@ ize lec@@ tur@@ ers in cur@@ ses to the Rel@@ ativity of theory often a correct li@@ mbs dance .
&quot; stretching and du@@ st@@ akes , stretching and du@@ sty . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that Gra@@ vit@@ ational is extremely weak , even ri@@ dic@@ ulous . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September , for example , every one of us fig@@ ured out the waves of the waves and increased . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was ten high . &quot;
&quot; that is called 20 N@@ ul@@ len after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1st Dar@@ um , one declared the LI@@ GO staff for crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five kilometres long laser det@@ ector , and that &apos;s already absur@@ d , this length would have to be measured on less than a thousand of the radius of an atom@@ ic nu@@ cle@@ us . this is gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k . &quot;
at the end of his classic text via gra@@ v@@ itation
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of LI@@ GO@@ s , the hunting for the waves of the following : &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties when building such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot;
&quot; but Physi@@ ci@@ sts are sin@@ ful and with the support of the public , all obstacles are overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
&quot; back to LI@@ GO . Scott holds , LO@@ GO be more an ear than one eye . &quot;
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wave @-@ length , which is much smaller than the things around us : faci@@ als , the size of your hand . &quot;
&quot; this is quite practical , because so you can customize a picture or a map of things by doing that of several points of coming light around you . &quot;
in pot@@ tery is that different .
audi@@ ble t@@ ints have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; that &apos;s why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things which means you especially much . &quot;
the face of your child approximately .
&quot; instead , we are according to certain properties such as clay and height , rhythm and volume to close attention to the story behind it . &quot;
&quot; now , just Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob inter@@ rup@@ ts them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; D@@ ome Bob &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the same applies to Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we can &apos;t make easy pictures of objects in the space with them .
&quot; but considering changes in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least lie for LI@@ GO the measured frequencies in the audi@@ ble area .
&quot; if we convert wave pattern in Sch@@ all , we can speak the All literally . &quot;
&quot; the gra@@ v@@ itation of lou@@ der , can tell us about a lot about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , which my colleague Scott has already very long . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , not rot@@ ating holes , p@@ aves easy : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; turn the two bodies very fast , you can hear the same ear@@ rings with an additional clay change . that sounds like at : W@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u ! &quot;
it is a sort of movement which is defined in the wav@@ el@@ form .
&quot; AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date , that at least I never forget to hear -- heard of the sound : &#91; sur@@ round of the sound &#93; Jem@@ and , who knows how to hear this as the sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ f@@ acher sun mass , which can turn around as fast as the st@@ illing of your mix@@ er . &quot;
AA : let &apos;s think about what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the tight@@ est body in the space , one with a mass of 29 son@@ ns , the other with a mass of 36 probe , the other one hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know that because we have heard it .
therein lies the permanent meaning of LI@@ GO .
&quot; LI@@ GO eb@@ net a completely new way to explore Al@@ ls , as it had never been possible before . &quot;
on this way we can hear the universe and hear the invisible .
&quot; much in all , we can not see -- practical or basically -- not see . &quot;
&quot; a Super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars in Super@@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de . &quot;
they are very useful . from them we learned a lot about all of them .
&quot; the exciting physical activity occur but at the core , which lies behind thousand kilometers from iron , carbon and si@@ licon brick . &quot;
we will never pass through it as this op@@ ak are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational w@@ cros@@ ses iron , as if it would be more transparent glass . the Ur@@ g@@ all : I would like to explore the first minutes of the Al@@ ls , but we will never see it , since the ur@@ ine will never be covered by its own off@@ spring . &quot;
&quot; using Gra@@ vit@@ ational , it should be possible to withdraw from the beginning to the beginning . &quot;
&quot; and the most important : I am optim@@ istic that we have never seen in all things we have never seen before , which we have never seen before , and of whom we have no idea of what we only discover , by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , LI@@ GO found the first starting point in fact that we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague on M@@ IT , Matt Evans , an important member of the LI@@ GO project , says to this topic : ME : the kind of stars , the black holes are observed , the din@@ os@@ au@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies from pre@@ historic times . the black lion are so@@ aked the su@@ perf@@ ood for our ar@@ che@@ ological work . &quot;
&quot; LI@@ GO enables us to create a completely different point of view on the events in the space , to the emergence of the stars and ultimately it on how we came out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge is now to be as bra@@ ve as possible .
&quot; thanks to LI@@ GO , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and lau@@ gh the rust@@ ling and p@@ aves of the cosmo@@ s . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ at@@ ories -- a brand new generation of observ@@ at@@ ories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than the pri@@ ce@@ all itself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thanks .
a while ago I tried a experim@@ ent .
&quot; one year I would say to all &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; I was afraid of whom I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; whether it made me nervous , brought me to un@@ pleasant situations , I &apos;m going to tell me &quot; Yes . &quot;
I wanted to talk to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
wanted to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
wanted to start playing with the spect@@ acle ?
&quot; no , no , no , but yes , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly what to do , w@@ ov@@ or I f@@ ear@@ ed my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear , speeches to keep my social fear -- Pu@@ ff . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
&quot; but there was a certain yes , that my life changed deeply , on an un@@ expected post . it started with a question of my to@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the small , calls for in@@ explic@@ able reasons all &quot; &quot; k@@ ittens , &quot;
as if she was a wa@@ iter in the south .
&quot; k@@ ittens , I needed milk for my schn@@ apps . &quot;
she asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said : &quot; yes . &quot;
that yes was the beginning
&quot; a new way of life in my family . from there I con@@ den@@ sed me to always play with them as soon as you go to them . no matter what I just do , or where I go , I say Yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I am not perfect , but I really notice me very much . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family . &quot;
&quot; but it also has a b@@ loss@@ al side effect : just before short , I actually stood complete that the &quot; yes &quot; -@@ must be saved my career with my children . &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am author . I think things that awak@@ ens you to life .

I created television . I have produced television .
I make television , in great style . &quot;
&quot; in this TV season , I am responsible for taking over 70 hours of program into the world . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
&quot; every shipment offers hundreds of jobs , which does not exist . &quot;
the budget for an episode of a television can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
&quot; a new episode all nine days four shows , so all nine days 20 million dollar TV , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three ship@@ ments , at the same time , 21 ep@@ isodes : Sc@@ andal , 15 ep@@ isodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 ep@@ isodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of television , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
in America the living room run my TV set on Thursday evening .
all over the world have been running my series in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spect@@ ators .
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts , which I have created myself , and not only produced , so I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans around camp@@ fire and to tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four television ser@@ p@@ ies , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire , around the world . &quot;
do you know who this still makes ?
&quot; nobody , therefore I am a tit@@ anium . &quot;

I would not like to impress with it .
&quot; I say it , because I know what you think when the word &quot; author falls . &quot;
&quot; I say it to you , that all of you who work so hard if you now speak a company , a country or a household , take me seriously if I say not only at the computer , and it is true when I say , I understand that it does not work with a dream job to dream . &quot;
&quot; it is all a job , everything work , everything reality , all blood , all silence -- not t@@ ears . &quot;
I work much , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I am deep@@ ened in the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country out of not@@ hing@@ ness .
&quot; it is , when I set troops on a canvas than m@@ old I upon a canvas . &quot;
&quot; as a dream@@ y , you have a high tone , lie@@ fe a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ yon@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love it to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechan@@ ically , exhau@@ sting and in@@ scru@@ pul@@ ling , funny and respect@@ ful , clin@@ ically and hum@@ bly , cru@@ el and reasonable . and the best thing about it is the sums . &quot;
there is such a change in me when the work is well running .
&quot; a sw@@ amp begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sw@@ amp sounds like a busy road , I could always go on for you . &quot;
&quot; many people take , when I conqu@@ er them the sw@@ amp that I agree with writing , that writing me joy . &quot;
do not understand me wrong that does it .
&quot; but the sum@@ men -- when I started working with television production , when I began to work and work , build and work together , I discovered this thing , this energy , this energy . the sums ! &quot;
the tot@@ als is more than the writing .
the sums of action is action and activity . the tot@@ als is a drug .
the tot@@ als is music . the sw@@ amp is light and air .
the sw@@ amp is the voice of God in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a sw@@ amp , then you can not strive differently from size . &quot;
&quot; the feeling , not otherwise able to strive than to size , no matter , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the sw@@ amp .
or maybe it also means a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
maybe it is called gen@@ ius .
perhaps it is called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I do not know it .
&quot; I just know that I am not afraid of failure , and I just know that I love the tot@@ als . &quot;
&quot; I will only tell you , I am a Titan , and I know that I will not want it to question . &quot;
&quot; in order to make a clear : the more ep@@ isodes , the more ep@@ isodes , the more ep@@ isodes , the more work there , the more things simultaneously , the more things simultaneously , the more we write story , so much expectations are there . &quot;
&quot; the more I work , the more it has to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
I love job , not true ?
&quot; the country , which I have a marathon that I walk , the army , the canvas , the high tone , the sw@@ amp , the sums of sums . &quot;
I like this summ@@ ing . I love the sw@@ amp .
I need the sum@@ p . I am the sw@@ amp .
am I just this summ@@ ing ?
and then the sum@@ o stops .
&quot; revised , over@@ loaded , over@@ bur@@ nt . &quot;
the sum stops .
&quot; now , my three daughters to the truth are acc@@ ustom@@ ed to the truth that their mom is a single work . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; my mother will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
and Emer@@ son says : &quot; Sch@@ ittens , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot;
there are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
you are Baby @-@ Tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the tot@@ als heard . &quot;
the sum of the engine is mu@@ te .
I don &apos;t loved my work anymore . the engine was out .
the sw@@ amp came not back .
my tot@@ als was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours of days , passed , no rep@@ ent@@ ance , nothing deleg@@ ating , a Titan sleeps , does not exist , with all the heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no sums .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect tit@@ anium .
&quot; I was a pre @-@ show , Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sw@@ amp and the sw@@ aps I was .
&quot; so , what makes you do , the work you do , the work you love , suddenly missed ? &quot;
&quot; I know , some may think : &quot; Heu@@ le you out , flash@@ ing the author @-@ tit@@ anium . &quot;
&quot; but you know you do it , you love you love to be a sav@@ er to be a sav@@ er to be a sav@@ er to be a painter , Bill Gates , and knows how to stop the sw@@ amp , when the sum@@ men stops , who is it then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart , I can survive in silence ? &quot;
and then me my &quot; South @-@ states @-@ Kell@@ ner@@ in &quot; is a question .
&quot; I am on the way out there , late dr@@ an and she says : &quot; Mama , mag@@ st you play ? &quot;
and I want to say No things to be aware of two things :
&quot; first , I must say yes to all and secondly , they didn &apos;t know me &quot; . &quot; &quot;
it does not call anyone more &quot; for@@ k@@ ittens . &quot;
when is this happening ?
&quot; I missed it when I am tit@@ anium and my tot@@ als , and here everything is changing my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so says it : &quot; Mama , mag@@ st you play ? &quot;
and I say : &quot; yes . &quot;
there is nothing special .
&quot; we are playing and her sisters , we lau@@ gh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; . &quot; &quot;
nothing exceptional .
&quot; but it is outstanding , because my pain and my panic , in lon@@ eliness and absence of the tot@@ ality , I can do nothing , except up@@ up@@ up@@ ups . &quot;
I am foc@@ uss@@ ed .
I am silent .
&quot; the land , which I have a marathon that I walk , the army , the canvas , the high tone - they no longer exist anymore . &quot;
&quot; everything that exists are glu@@ ed finger and hum@@ idi@@ fied kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax pen@@ cils and the song , in which it comes to slogan , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Hotel &quot; . &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so short that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me sol@@ ves himself .
a mental door goes on and an energy control comes in .
&quot; and this not immediately , but it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the sw@@ amp is slowly coming back .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it is silent , hardly list@@ able , but it is there . &quot;
&quot; not the sums , but a sw@@ amp . &quot;
and now I feel as if I know a magical secret .
but let us remain in the matter .
it is love . this is all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something that we have forgotten .
&quot; the sw@@ amp , the working environment , the fix@@ ings , that is just the substitute . &quot;
&quot; if I ask who you are , when I tell you who I am , if I am happy with the help of broad@@ casts and television hours and as well @-@ capable of my brain , then I for@@ got what the real sums is . &quot;
the sw@@ amp is not power and it is not work @-@ specific .
it is dependent on the joy .
real sums depends on the love .
&quot; the sw@@ amp is the flow , which comes from the li@@ l@@ ust . &quot;
the real sums is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; the real sums are ignored the pressure of the history , which lead to done tasks , the expect@@ ation and the pressure . &quot;
the real sums is simple and original .
&quot; the real sums of God is voice in my ear , but perhaps I fle@@ w me the wrong words , for which God said me to me that I am a Titan Poker ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a bit more love , much more love . &quot;
once my child wants to play with me I will say yes .
I have been doing this for a solid rule so that I can deliver myself as a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic of any fault .
&quot; it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice , if I want to hear the sw@@ amp . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so simple . I am not good in playing , I like it . &quot;
play me not ans@@ as such as working .
&quot; the truth is doing , &quot;
but I do not like to play .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer at the workplace as at home .
&quot; this entry is pain@@ ful , because what a person works better than to be home ? &quot;
&quot; well , me . &quot;
&quot; time honest , I n@@ enne myself &quot; Titan , -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of it .
&quot; we ras@@ en in the garden around , before and back , and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play Ball .
we are frag@@ ile soap bub@@ bles .
&quot; in doing so , I am mostly we@@ alth@@ y , ab@@ sent and conf@@ used . &quot;
I travelled always after my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the sw@@ amp of the universe meets me . &quot;
&quot; I play and play , until I ask myself : why have we ever heard with the games ? &quot;
you can also tell it ! they always tell you if your child wants to play with you .
&quot; perhaps hold me for na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day @-@ bear@@ er . &quot;
you are probably right but you can also do it !
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not Ri@@ h@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et @-@ Show figure .
your child will find you less interesting when you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little want to play at a maximum of 15 minutes with me , up to them that they want to make something different . &quot;
&quot; there are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes I re@@ places a Mari@@ enk@@ er or K@@ eks .
&quot; and , my teenage daughter whole 15 minutes long with me , I am mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; there are only 15 minutes , more do not need it . &quot;
&quot; everyone can bring 15 minutes a piece , even at a tu@@ cked &quot; &quot; La@@ e @-@ Day ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes at the piece !
&quot; no mobile , no laundry , no distr@@ action . &quot;
the day is short : dinner , the kids finished . &quot;
but 15 minutes are dr@@ in !
&quot; my children are my char@@ ds , my world . there must not be the children . it is true to feel the tot@@ als to have a place for his soul . &quot;
it &apos;s not about playing with their own children . it is about joy ;
about the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
treat yourself in 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing good .
find out it and keep it out .
&quot; I am not perfect in it . I fail and I si@@ ege . friends meet , books read , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I got up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training , when I wanted to make myself more and more . &quot;
&quot; 15 minutes a piece , why not full 15 minutes of experience ? &quot;
what can it be wrong ? nothing !
&quot; the sw@@ amp came back in my free time . the sum@@ men seems to return , if I do not work . &quot;
working not without playing .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months opens up a door , the energy flows and I find me in my office . I am hearing myself and my soul . she l@@ ush me up his way . I use it in full gul@@ ps and love my work again . &quot;
I like the tot@@ als but I do not love it .
I do not need it .
&quot; I am not the sums of sums , the sum@@ men is not me ... no more . &quot;
soap bub@@ bles and glu@@ ed finger , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is now my sums .
the sums of life .
the sum of love .
&quot; the sums of work is part of me , but just a part . and for this I am so grateful . &quot;
&quot; it is me , that I am a tit@@ anium . I have never seen a Titan , the journey to Jerusalem . &quot;
I said Yes to fewer work and to play more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clear is my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sw@@ amp . the land , which I walk , the marathon , the tro@@ phy , the big tone , the tot@@ als , the sw@@ amp , the sums of the sums of life : the sums of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this tot@@ als , the more makes this unusual , illustr@@ ative , naked and new life @-@ feeling in me wide . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this sums , the more I know who I am . &quot;
I am author . I think things I aw@@ ake you to life .
&quot; this belongs to the job , which means to live his dream . &quot;
that is the dream of this job ;
because a dream job should be a bit dream@@ y .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and to more games .
Tit@@ ans have no chance .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thanks nice .
I am a neuro@@ surgical procedure .
as most of my colleagues I have to do with human trag@@ e@@ dies every day .
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a heavy stroke or after a car accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ y it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , a very little ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a severe violation of the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disabilities . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I was functional neuro@@ sur@@ urg@@ in .
what is a functional Neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ on ?
a doctor who tries to improve the ner@@ ve functions through various surgical measures .
&quot; certainly they have heard of one of the most famous one of the &quot; &quot; Tief@@ enh@@ ir@@ n@@ ication &quot; . &quot; it impl@@ anted a electric de deep in the brain to influence the cir@@ cuits of neur@@ ons so that neuro@@ logical function enh@@ ances . &quot;
it really is an amazing technology . she has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ in@@ son , which suffered under the he@@ aters and heavy pain . &quot;
&quot; however , neuro@@ modul@@ ation does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing . &quot;
the dream working al neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ y is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I want to show you that we are very close .
with some help the brain can help itself .
history began 15 years ago .
at the time I was conduc@@ ting Ober@@ dentists and worked every day and night in the not@@ ion .
often I put patients with sk@@ ull tra@@ verse t@@ trau@@ ma .
you have to imagine that at sk@@ ull @-@ Hir@@ n trau@@ mas and the sk@@ ull pressure .
&quot; to save life , you have to don@@ ate the sk@@ ull pressure . &quot;
&quot; for this , one sometimes have to remove a part of s@@ wollen shepherd . &quot;
&quot; instead of cast away , we decided to analyze with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , the shep@@ her@@ ds . &quot;
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissues .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; to let cells grow from a tissue , it is comparable with very small children that are taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; you have to find the right diet , temperature , moisture and the environments to release them . &quot;
exactly that we had to do with these cells .
after many publishers it Jean @-@ François .
this saw it under his micros@@ cope .
it was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly as a stem cell culture . with large green cells that are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells . &quot;
perhaps you are still aware of the bi@@ ologi@@ c lessons that stem cells un@@ ri@@ pe cells can turn into each cell type of organism .
&quot; the adult brain does stem cells , but very few . you are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast .
they never die they are imm@@ ort@@ al .
but these cells stopped different .
they are very slowly and after a couple of weeks she even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , wei@@ rd cell population which looked like stem cells , but it was different . &quot;
&quot; we needed long , to understand what they came . &quot;
it origin@@ ates from these cells .
these blue and red cells are hot Dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
you make 4 % of our main hir@@ ing boards .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us they ensure the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay with us ?
we do not know .
&quot; we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concent@@ rations close to bra@@ in@@ viol@@ ations . &quot;
but this is not so safe .
&quot; however , one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells . &quot;
&quot; we stand in front of a potential cell source , the bra@@ id division . &quot;
this had to prove .
so we decided to develop an experim@@ ent .
&quot; we wanted a piece of bra@@ in@@ ths from the non @-@ lingu@@ istic area , and then the cells can be as cultiv@@ ate as it Jean @-@ François did . &quot;
and they subsequently mark colour to follow them in the brain .
in the last step we travel@@ ed them at the con@@ fis@@ cation of the same individual .
we call the autonom@@ ous tran@@ splan@@ tation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ t .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we travel@@ ed these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we travel@@ ed the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we could work with monkey .
&quot; in the first scenario we travel@@ ed the cells into a healthy brain , and we wat@@ ched that they had been removed after a few weeks when they were sent back home . the room is already occupied , they will not used there , so they disappear . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario we released a bre@@ ach and rei@@ pl@@ anted the same cells , and now the cells remain stri@@ kes to mature neur@@ ons . &quot;
here you can see what we could watch under the micros@@ cope .
these are the cells that were travel@@ ed .
&quot; evidence they show , these small points are these small points . these are the cells that we were in vit@@ ro , in the culture . &quot;
here we could not stop .
help these cells also have a ape to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual activity .
they had to take food pell@@ ets of one tray .
they made them very well .
&quot; when they achieved a stable action level , we last for the mot@@ oric Cortex in the Hand@@ mot@@ ori@@ k area . &quot;
&quot; finally the monkeys were par@@ aly@@ sed , they could not move their hand anymore . &quot;
&quot; as it would happen to people , they re@@ covered spont@@ ane@@ ously up to some extent , just like after a stroke . &quot;
the patients are par@@ aly@@ zed and then try to recover with the help of plas@@ tical brain mechanisms . they recover to some degree , just as with the monkey . &quot;
&quot; when we were sure that the A@@ efs had reached its degree of spont@@ aneous recovery , impl@@ anted its own cells . &quot;
on the left you see the monkey which spont@@ ane@@ ously relaxing .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance prior to the injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now , see as we travel@@ ed the cells , the same ap@@ aces , two months after the maturity . &quot;
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
since this time we have found much more about these cells .
we can use them fre@@ ez@@ ing and later use .
&quot; we can use them in other neuro@@ path@@ ological models , for example at Park@@ in@@ son . &quot;
&quot; however , our dream is still to impl@@ ant them to impl@@ ant . &quot;
I genu@@ in@@ ely hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives the means to heal yourself .
thanks .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ ely@@ ne that is wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just several do@@ zen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who need that . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question of what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials in human beings . &quot;
J@@ oc@@ ely@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . proce@@ eding from these great results you have to fill about two kil@@ ograms papers and forms to run this kind of studies .
BG : this is understand@@ able that the brain is very delicate etc .
&quot; J@@ b : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- You have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials , how many years lasts until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ b : this is difficult to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical study . &quot;
will it allow ourselves to start the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it has a long time to choose the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment . &quot;
&quot; after that , one has to apply this to a multi @-@ cent@@ ric study . &quot;
one has to really point out that it is useful before you can offer this treatment .
BG : and that it is certain of course . J@@ b : natural .
BG : J@@ oc@@ ely@@ ne that thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a great mistake to consider it as a matter of course .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the frag@@ ile plant that it is in reality , but as invent@@ ory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider it as an imm@@ utable contra@@ dic@@ tory .
we believe capitalism necessarily leads to democracy .
this is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great neigh@@ bor in Beijing have undoubtedly proved , that it is quite possible to have an blo@@ oming capitalism and impressive growth while politics is completely und@@ em@@ ocratic . &quot;
&quot; indeed , democracy at us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was declared that the democratic process of our country -- our elections - not to influence austerity , which were realised in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at this moment , I thought that there could be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my sincer@@ ely friends told me that democracy would be abol@@ ished . &quot;
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy .
&quot; I ask you to believe in together with me , that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a Ir@@ r@@ believe , we could save the democracy , but that we need a truly and def@@ ender democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy , our societies are engaged in our future , and our great , new technologies are wast@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of waste , I would like to point you on an interesting contradiction that is currently our t@@ avern . &quot;
&quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; Zw@@ il@@ ings@@ gi@@ ap@@ ples @-@ parad@@ ox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a summit is known to you . they know and recognize it as the debt hill , who thro@@ ws up his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; all of us recognize the Schul@@ den@@ berg , &quot;
yet few recognize his tw@@ illing .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash , which is part of an@@ x@@ ious austerity and corporations , which would be to an@@ x@@ ious where it would be productive and income , with which one could be productive and also provide all the things that humanity is urg@@ ently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I ask them two numbers .
&quot; in the past 3 months were invested in the United States , in England and the Eurozone , in all its prosperity producing goods , such as industrial installations , machines , office buildings , schools , cars , equipment , and so on and so on . &quot;
&quot; 3.4 tr@@ ons US dollars , after a lot of money , until one gets compar@@ isons with the 5,@@ 1 tr@@ il@@ lion dollars , which came at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing , except the stock exchange rates and the real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus , deb@@ ts and un@@ productive capital make the Gem@@ ill@@ ings@@ gi@@ ap@@ ples , which is not out of the usual market mechanism . &quot;
&quot; the result are st@@ agn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of 25 @-@ 54 years , and consequently , a low cost @-@ economic demand , which could not invest in which they would not invest . just like o@@ edi@@ pus Father , who is not afraid that his son would kill him if he will grow , &quot;
&quot; un@@ disp@@ uted the circumstances , which lead to that eco @-@ pus him k@@ ills . &quot;
this is my ha@@ er with capitalism --
&quot; its extremely difficult art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , human tal@@ ents continue to develop and particularly all the technologies to finance , &quot; green &quot; technologies , which are decisive for saving the earth . &quot;
so democracy is the solution ?
I already believe . but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ otel@@ es defined democracy as the company form in which the free and arms control the poor as a majority .
the ath@@ ic democracy included too many from --
&quot; women , for@@ eig@@ ners , and of course sl@@ aves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be an error , the importance of ath@@ ic democracy due to that out@@ lines . &quot;
&quot; the decision on the ath@@ ic democracy was and is that it was not only the right to freedom of expression , and not only the right to freedom of expression , but more import@@ antly , and defining them the right to political co@@ si@@ zing in questions of government bodies . &quot;
ath@@ ic democracy has not been kept long --
&quot; as a cand@@ le , the very bright lights , it is also fast spread . &quot;
&quot; however , our contemporary liberal democr@@ acies have not their roots in the ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glori@@ ous revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while ath@@ ic democracy focused on the free citizens and the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for prev@@ ailing . &quot;
&quot; liberal democracy only came upon as a complete separation between politics and economy , and the democratic process has been incorporated into politics , while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- a democrati@@ cally @-@ free zone was established . &quot;
&quot; in our today &apos;s democr@@ acies , since the time in which this separation between politics and economy began , an un@@ preced@@ ented struggle between the two by the economy gradually mig@@ rant politicians and they de@@ ed . &quot;
are you wonder why politicians do not have any more such as before ?
it is not at a de@@ generation of their DNA .
it is that one cannot be in the government nowadays and still not in power because the power of politics into the economy is divided into the economy .
I mentioned my ha@@ dern with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is about as a flo@@ ck of rob@@ bers who has so sustainable the animals , from which they are nour@@ ished , dec@@ lined to the end therefore . &quot;
&quot; similarly , it is related to the economy which the politics has become so far can@@ nib@@ bles , that it grows due to the self @-@ induc@@ ed economic crisis itself , the power of corporations grows , economic demand falls and the managing director of corporations have to be s@@ ard@@ ed to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism of the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &quot; &#91; the people &#93; out of democracy , the higher the comp@@ ill@@ ings@@ gi@@ ap@@ ples , and the greater the waste of human labour power and welfare of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if that is true , it is obvious that we have to bring the policy and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; dem@@ os &quot; control remains , apart from the exclusion of sl@@ aves , the women and the for@@ eig@@ ners . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
the Marx@@ ist lin@@ ke had this idea already 100 years ago and it did not seem to be good .
the doctrine of the Deb@@ ak@@ el of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor is restored only through a miracle like in ancient Athens without creating new species of bru@@ t@@ ality and waste .
but there is one solution : the working poor !
capitalism does it by being replaced by Ni@@ ed@@ rig@@ rewar@@ ding by automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is to be so long economy and politics separate areas , the automation of Gem@@ ill@@ ings@@ gi@@ ap@@ ples can be higher , the waste management , and the social conflicts deeper , as it is already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come . &quot;
&quot; so we have to re@@ design the economy and re@@ un@@ ite the areas of economy and politics , and thereby pay attention to the re@@ union area , otherwise we will let the movie &quot; matrix &quot; like a documentation . &quot;
&quot; so , the question is not whether capitalism has the technical achievements that he has brought to survive -- &quot;
&quot; the most interesting question is whether capitalism is going through a dy@@ no , similar to the &quot; matrix &quot; , &quot; in which machines serve man and people put their energy into the research of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks on the meaning of life . &quot;
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
&quot; so what does it look , how could it look like this &quot; star Trek &quot; &quot; ar@@ mature ut@@ opia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ similar dy@@ stop@@ ie ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation I would like to give you , in all soon , some examples . &quot;
&quot; in the field of companies : ask for a capital market , where you have money earned , while you work and in which your capital is going to you from one company to the next , and the company -- regardless of which one is currently working -- is property of those who currently work in the company . &quot;
then all income from capital and from arous@@ al and the concept of wage labor is completely out@@ dated .
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the companies but do not work in it , and employees who are working there . no ex@@ pul@@ ling out between capital and labour , no major g@@ aps between investment and spher@@ es , and ultimately not a rag@@ ing tw@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy : please make sure that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest gay countries &#93; , in the interest of the whole of humanity . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , you continue to tra@@ p that the entire world bank in this currency will be tra@@ ded -- we call it &quot; &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; &quot; in units of &quot; cosmo@@ s &quot; &quot; -- and every government pays the sum that represents the commercial de@@ fic@@ it or the surplus @-@ surplus from the respective country into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world , in which investment . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes was proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time one had not put the technical means at that time .
&quot; today , we have them , especially in the background of a re@@ united politics and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world , which I describe them at the same time , at the same time , and Marx@@ ist , because they buried the separation of capital and labour in M@@ ül@@ ste of the story , and key@@ nesi@@ an , global key@@ nesi@@ an . &quot;
&quot; but above all others , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy . &quot;
will we wake up in such a world
or will we put in a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar Dy@@ sp@@ ie ?
the answer depends on how we decide in politically politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democratic .
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography itself as a liberal Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I just said , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... doing this , the technological development will generate such massive decline in the overall economic demand , what Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers is referred to as &quot; long term st@@ agn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; through the transmission of this crisis from a part of the earth to the next , as we &apos;re currently experiencing it is not only our democr@@ acies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is applicable , then Marx is quite relevant . &quot;
&quot; just like Hay@@ ek , therefore I am a liberal Marx@@ ist , and like Key@@ nes , and that is why I am completely wir@@ r . &quot;
&quot; BG : in fact , and now we are at ease . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you are not wir@@ r , you do not think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Ein@@ stein that said to Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers , you have very clear what you think of the view of the West in China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democr@@ acies we have the star@@ tion of democracy .
&quot; as I said in my presentation , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of the economy -- a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in some respects , when I must say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , similar China today the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism to democracy -- this is a mistake , historically considered . &quot;
&quot; liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
&quot; he was particularly skep@@ tical , which concerns the democratic development . &quot;
&quot; what one can observe in China now , similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; China now prefer@@ able to do what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ ells huge to hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
&quot; BG : I am sure that many list@@ en@@ ers was curious to your experiences as a financial minister of Greece at the beginning of the year . &quot;
Y@@ V : I think that this comes .
BG : yes ...
how are you looking for six months later on the first half @-@ year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ appoint@@ ing , because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the euro zone , &quot;
&quot; namely to adopt us from self @-@ suffici@@ ency , and the continuous den@@ ial @-@ den@@ ial which went out through the euro@@ zone and continues to massi@@ vely threat@@ ening the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- the way , the first suggestion was that this den@@ ial was revealed -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately it is right to do . unfortunately , the powers within the Eurozone , within the European group , continue to den@@ ied the den@@ ial . &quot;
but you know yes what comes .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one tries to get an economic system , which is not convinc@@ ing , through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , it might be hes@@ it@@ ated , but if the change occurs , he happens ab@@ rupt and destruc@@ tive . &quot;
BG : what changes are you looking ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have the future if we do not change its construction .
BG : have you made any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- seriously ...
&quot; if there is a financial minister , or any minister , who claims after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , claims , he did not make mistakes , then it is a dangerous person . &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the greatest mistake was to sign the request for the extension of the school programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the don@@ ors to find a common solution .
but that was not .
&quot; they merely wanted to bring our government only , because they did not want to deal with the comp@@ eting through the euro@@ zone . &quot;
they did not want to conf@@ ess that she has led a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal B@@ IP .
&quot; there is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; none of the Troika of the bank@@ er who has raised to us this policy , and a : &quot; that was a kol@@ os@@ s@@ al mistakes . &quot;
&quot; BG : in spite of all this , and despite the aggressive T@@ ons of talks , you seem to be fairly pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone does not come from someone who lives Europe and loves . &quot;
my greatest fear is that the euro zone is not survi@@ ved .
&quot; for if they are not survi@@ ved , are destro@@ ying the chosen tile of the tile and destro@@ ying the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not be dis@@ astro@@ us alone for Europe , but for the entire world economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest industry of the world .
&quot; if we put ourselves on the way of an post @-@ modern 1930 to hit it , it will be also possible for the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope so that you are wrong in this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you so much that you were at TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thanks .
&quot; by Ro@@ y Price , most of them have never heard , although he is probably responsible for 22 @-@ moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for many of you . &quot;
&quot; this goes back to the decision , the Ro@@ y had three years ago . &quot;
Ro@@ y Price is a leading class at Amazon Studios .
the TV @-@ Production company of Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a icons and describes on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technology , t@@ aco@@ s . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ y has a very important job , because he is responsible for this , shows the shows and the content that will produce Amazon . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fighting industry . &quot;
there are so many TV series that Ro@@ y cannot select any one .
&quot; he has to find shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
in other words he must find shows that are right on this curve .
this curve is the application distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ D@@ b site . the assessment goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review receive .
&quot; will make your show with nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows how &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows , the sweet , where , after one has a season , your brain asks , &quot; where are there more of this ep@@ isodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left hand side , here at this end , are shows how &quot; Tod@@ d@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- this should tell you enough what goes to that end of the curve . &quot;
Ro@@ y Price does not worry about the left side of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to teach &quot; Tod@@ d@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the middle balance , the average television -- the shows , which are neither good nor bad they do not delight them . &quot;
so he must ensure that he is really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time making Amazon as something that &apos;s why Ro@@ y Is nothing ris@@ ky . &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a contest . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and are chosen by an evaluation eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts it online , where they can watch any free of charge . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon w@@ ouldn &apos;t matter something else , you can still compre@@ h@@ end ? &quot;
millions of spect@@ ators look at this ep@@ isodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they are observed when viewing this shows . &quot;
they are observed by Ro@@ y and his team who will pick up everything .
&quot; you capture , when to start the show when you are con@@ den@@ sed , which parts you can ski@@ pped and again . &quot;
collect millions of data to decide with these data that show them should be produced .
&quot; in fact they collect the data , process these and this gives the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com about four Repub@@ li@@ can U.S. sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made these show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that don &apos;t seem to remember that show because it was not so good . &quot;
&quot; it is only one average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- as the average of this curve 7,@@ 4 is and Alpha House lan@@ es at 7,5 -- so somewhat above average , but not exactly what is wor@@ ding on Ro@@ y and his team . &quot;
&quot; about at the same time at another company , another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . its name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Ro@@ y he is always looking for it to find these a super show and it also uses data for it but it makes it a little different . &quot;
&quot; instead of cont@@ empl@@ ating a competition , he and his team will give up the existing data about the Net@@ fli@@ x spect@@ ators , so the ratings they give the shows whose course shows them , which shows they like etc . &quot;
&quot; then use these data to find these little details of the spect@@ ators : what shows they like , what producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they entered a wag@@ on and decided to do not have a sit@@ com about four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; . Net@@ fli@@ x has taken a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 rating on this curve . so , exactly where they wanted . &quot;
of course is the question : what happened here ?
one has two very un@@ peti@@ tive , data sealed companies . &quot;
they combine these many data with each other and it works super for one of them but not for the other company .
what is it ?
because the logic exists somehow that all should work in all .
&quot; if one coll@@ ects millions of data for a decision that one meets , then you should make a good decision . &quot;
it has 200 years of statistics as Back @-@ Up .
it is optimized with very powerful computer .
&quot; Mind@@ fulness what you can expect , is good television , or ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work , then this is something fri@@ ght@@ ening , because we live in a time in which we attack more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
knows someone here the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; no . OK , that is even good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one comes in this room in touch with this software . come in touch with it , you are in prison . &quot;
&quot; if someone is in prison in prison and for dischar@@ ge , it is probably that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dism@@ is@@ sal is done or not . &quot;
&quot; but as with Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad , will be decided whether a person is good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate television , 22 minutes , that may be genuine bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that these data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always created the best results . this is not that a company like multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data .
the data is also reversible .
&quot; yes , even Google does sometimes make mistakes . &quot;
&quot; 2009 , Google announced that they can tell through data analysis break@@ outs of flu , the sch@@ lim@@ men type , pre@@ dictions -- by data analysis of Google Search . &quot;
it worked fine and was a great news sens@@ ation . the success story was published in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked impeccable , year round the year , until it suddenly won &apos;t work more functional , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it worked simply not , this was again a sens@@ ation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data diversi@@ fied companies such as Amazon and Google mis@@ understand@@ ings are sometimes something .
&quot; despite all of these errors data in decisions of life a -- on the workplace , in the place of law , in medicine . &quot;
&quot; so , we would prefer to ensure that data are helpful . &quot;
&quot; also , I have many difficulties with data . I work in the computer @-@ based gene@@ tics -- an area where some very clever people in@@ concei@@ vable many data to make serious decisions , as the decision for a cancer therapy &quot;
or the development of a medication . over the years I recognized some patterns over the difference between successful decisions using data and no successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
&quot; you have to solve a complex problem , do they mainly do two things : &quot;
&quot; as a first , you put this problem into its parts , so that you can analyze the parts ; as a branch , you put the parts again to take a resolution . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : apart and set up again . &quot;
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help create a problem and understand his parts . &quot;
they are not able to re@@ ate the parts again and then come to a resolution .
for this there is a different tool and we possess it all : our brain .
&quot; when there is something in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces again to summar@@ ize , even if the information is in@@ complete to gr@@ asp a good resolution -- especially when it is the brain &apos;s brain . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I believe I was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful because they have used data and mind , where they are also executed in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience , where else they would not have been able . but the decision on how to put all these parts , and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; , &quot; which was not in the data . &quot;
&quot; T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they entered a big personal risk with this decision . &quot;
Amazon others did so on the wrong way .
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first as they w@@ int@@ ed for TV @-@ ideas , then as she chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as show . &quot;
it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; they tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired outcome .
&quot; data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe that things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how power@@ fully they are , data are just a tool , and not to forget that this device is fairly useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
&quot; it is also called &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; . it is amazing . for decisions using a ja@@ - or no question you need to sh@@ ake the ball , to get an answer . &quot; highly likely &quot; -- just here in this moment . &quot;
I will return it later with a techn@@ ar demo .
&quot; so far , I have made some decisions taken in my life , whereby I could have heard in the ball on the ball . &quot;
&quot; but , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace it by something much ex@@ changed , such as data analysis , to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; thus , perhaps the ball cl@@ amp and kl@@ ü@@ ger . ultimately , it is possible to make decisions to make decisions when we want to achieve something exceptional at the end of the right corner . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as very encouraging message that despite the great amount of data still pays off , decisions to meet , an expert in what you do is doing and risks . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it is not the data , but the risks associated with which you land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thanks nice .
