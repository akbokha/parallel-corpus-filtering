<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They might know him perhaps because he won as a New York Times Reporter the Pulitzer Prize.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before the one of Edward Snowden had heard, Risen wrote a book in which he spectacular that the NSA illegal telephones of Americans have heard."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">Therein he describes a catastrophic US secret cooperation in which the CIA was transferred to Iran in favour of an atomic bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">"if the crazy sounds, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">"but do you know, whom the chapters not changed?"</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. Government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for nearly 10 years, the government has been established against Risen and asked him to name his grown sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this train it became a symbol for the pattern of the government, whistleblowers and journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the first constitutional, the media have the right to publish good information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right, if media cannot get this information and if it cannot protect the identity of the Mud that they are inexpensive."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government came with cracks, he did something that many courageous reporters already did before him, and said that he would prefer to go into prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived closely with the risk to go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, only days before the process, something something exceptional."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although they have years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government have been abandoned."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the Reporter and sources can always hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of fail and cracks to the statements, this could also take his digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so shall the Mediator, without his permission, his calls for a secret,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like his e-mail data, financial and banking information, its credit card, and even frightened with the list of his flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA-Whistleblowers and crens verso."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama spoke at his arrival, Whistleblowers. but instead the judiciary has more condemned than all US governments before him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government is too much of their work than secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of that a whistleblowers went to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"thus we put the press work on the game, which should be protected by the first constitutional, because the government has more possibilities to hide all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as the technology of the government allows the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"while they are able to contact them from the moment, in which they contact us instead of into it, in the witness."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there are communication software that there was not yet, as Risen his book had written and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is Securedrop, an open source-source system for Whistleblowers, which was originally developed by the Internet of Aaron Swartz, and is today developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, at which I work, further developed."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of send an e-mail, go to a news website, just like the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents or send information, as in any common contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">"this will be encrypted and stored on a server, to which only the respective news agency has access."</seg>
<seg id="35">"so, the government can no longer blame the government and many of the information they would require, would not be available from previous."</seg>
<seg id="36">But SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world are always developing new espionetechnologies that are all endangered us with us."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is to ensure that not only technique denominator like Edward Snowden have a way to carry out misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next Whistleblowers,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"the talks about misses in the supply of soldiers humble knows and by flooded hospitals. or the next environmental representative, the alarm on the seated water of Flint proposes. or a Wallstreet Insider, which warned us before the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"nevertheless, these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">"[on 3 April 2016, the biggest datlery of the story was published.] [the" Panama papers ""] [we baten Robert Palmer from Global Witness to an explanation.] this week we were called messages about a lender of 11 million documents of in Panama. "</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we receive an impression of how customers, banks and Lawyers to companies such as Moso Fonseca and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you create it? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland Prime Minister has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="48">"also, there are reports that an allies of brutal dictator Baschar al-Assad briefing companies in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is claimed that a gap of 2 billion US dollars to Russia President Vladimir Putin introduces about a narrow friend from children's days, a famous cellists."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people, and others give the nervous to the next publication, and to the next unveiled documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the Plot of an agency grilled or a John-Grisham-chair.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems wept away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we achieve that?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and mighty in the position are to hide their assets in tax havens and do not pay all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organisation, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"throughout the world we discuss the media and leading politicians, such as a secret tax havens of some few to be utilized, their assets to hide and merge -- something that we have been discussing and uncover for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people appears quite confusing this whole world and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a sailors.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these prayers."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for criminal enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really understand what matters is."</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably because it has not been a prominent American so far in these revelations, this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">"now, it is not so that there are no rich Americans that hide their assets in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="65">"but through the principle, after which this tax havens work, Mosbag Fonseca fewer American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"we would have a data sheet of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have much more cases and examples which have connections to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is so that in some US states less information needs to provide less information to create a company than to get a librarian card."</seg>
<seg id="68">"this type of inflicence in the US has allowed the employees of school places, school children."</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed frauds to prevent especially anchodious investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">"so, we sent a covered investigators to the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan."</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigators gave himself as African ministers, who wanted to bring some money into the USA to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked it really that all the up to an attorney made our inventory suggestions as he could transfer its money.</seg>
<seg id="76">"these were all predominations. none of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course nobody was handed over to money. however, it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as a single accidents.</seg>
<seg id="78">"it is not about a single fire, which has underlined the printed proposals."</seg>
<seg id="79">"it is not about a single top-police, wrapped in a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to cope with this, we must change the rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">We must change the rules to create this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound all very trendy, as if we could not do anything against it; as if nothing could be changed, as if there is always the rich and mighty."</seg>
<seg id="84">But as well-born optimist I see that a lot to change has started.</seg>
<seg id="85">"over the past few years, we have seen a breaches to more transparency, which affects the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">"the topic found political attention by the British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 Summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland."</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU has captured in central registers at the national level, who is really behind firms in Europe and who is controlled."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the USA remains behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have brought a legislative activity in both parliamentarians, but this does not make progress that we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">"we need ordinary people who are angry, when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind headaches."</seg>
<seg id="93">We need executives in the economy which stand and say: "Intransparent is not good for the business."</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it by laws this kind of inconsistency."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can finally terminate the inconsistency, which now allows you to end this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">"this is the story, as I am almost kidnapped and in the boot of a red Mazch."</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after I had completed my design program, I made a backyard."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red mazda remained and looked my things.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my artwork.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip throughout the country. after that he would go to the peace trip.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him on a beer. he told me excited how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"as we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him," where shouldn't you think that night? "</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing worse: "I do not know it yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought:" Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What am I now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does the situation do not know?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him just! he says he would go to the peace corps, but I don't know if he is really plans. I don't want to end in the compartment of a maiden!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small suitcase!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard myself: "I have a bubbles. you can sleep in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="112">"one voice in my head said," uh, how please? "</seg>
<seg id="113">"night I was in bed, I threw up on the blanket and thought:" Oh Mann! what did I get out of it here? "</seg>
<seg id="114">A wilderness of the sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I got out of the bed, on taps at the door, and my sleeping corner door closed."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork that he bought from me depends today in his classroom. he is now teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">"maybe people were sold to me in childhood as strangers, actually friends who only expected to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"people on my airmatratze hosts, was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the airmatratze."</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's take a moment in two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost plastness, my roommate moves out and the rent is raised."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in town. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can make it to be afraid of fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote my best friend and new fellow-mates Brian Chesky:" Brian, I talked about how we could earn something. our apartment will be able to make a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, including a mattress and every morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha!</seg>
<seg id="129">We set up a website and screened so "airmatratze and breakfast" [AIRBed aNd Breakfast = Aircalb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep at home for 20 dollars on the airmatratze on woodwork floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I am sure, our cheese-ham-omelet tasted completely different because we made them for our guests."</seg>
<seg id="133">We walk with them through the whole city. when we met our last guest and the door came into the castle coincided Brian and I am.</seg>
<seg id="134">"we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time, and you could pay our rent?"</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, closed ourselves as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out whether you could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we presented our investors:" we want to create a website, on the people publicly make pictures of their private rooms, their bathrooms, their bathrooms -- the type of rooms, whose doors can be closed when you visit. "</seg>
<seg id="139">"over the Internet, they can then invite people to invite people to stay with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the rocket would be closed.</seg>
<seg id="142">Indeed they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">"nobody, who is still very close to Trost, would invest in a business, the strangers allowed to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we have learnt as children all that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if one has an issue, you can remember the things that you can well. we could be designated."</seg>
<seg id="147">"at the Kunstakademie, we learned that design much more than just looks and Haptik -- it is the overall experience."</seg>
<seg id="148">"we learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who had never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">"I would like to give you an incentive, which degree can trust us."</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-seconds experiment. it will force you out of your comfort.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs high when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your phone into the hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">"now, I would like to unlock your mobile phone."</seg>
<seg id="156">Type your corresponded mobile phone to your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">"this quietness of panic, which you now feel -- -- is exactly what the hosts can be felt if it was the first time opening the door."</seg>
<seg id="158">"for the only thing, which is even more personal than your mobile phone is your home."</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS text, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the phone of a stranger in the hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most of them feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">"so, most of the guests feel, if they are staying there."</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">"only once, who is now Al Gores's cell phone?"</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you proclaim on Twitter that he will be used for the office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now enter the manual now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You now have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build. I want to tell you some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What would be changed when we had changed a little detail about this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor would have been presented only once with his name; if he would have told what he comes, how his dog or his children will be called?"</seg>
<seg id="170">"imagine you would have 150 covers, which all say:" he can truly consolidate the wrys! "</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you would have to give your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-conceived feedback system strengthens the trust decisive.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we still had some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to give negative mortals.</seg>
<seg id="175">"finally, we decided to wait until both host and guest had given their supporters before we set them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we have conducted a study with Stanford's study. we examined how probably it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are in terms of age and residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprising we trust the people most that are the most resuming.</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less confidence we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="181">Exciting will be exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case with complaints.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three covers, nothing changes. "</seg>
<seg id="183">"but one has more than ten, changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good call stipulled common similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can thus help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">"moreover, we experienced that trust is dependent upon how much you can."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the responses to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you tell too little about how for example" Hi! ", you do not get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"he tells us a lot, as for example:" "I have problems with my mother --" -- "" the request is also not accepted. "</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g." "great artworks in your apartment! I do with my family vacation."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create it with design to create this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">"" "our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices compared to strangers."</seg>
<seg id="194">"what we did not reckoned, was the great amount of people who were more than ready to settle these prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people are entitled to use our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">"thirdly, a need, which was not covered before."</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business has just been very good.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who are unallowed parties celebrated or rented apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front front when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing Schlimmeres than this calls. it does already hurt when I think only.</seg>
<seg id="207">"the disappointment that can be heard in the voice of the sight, and will also be our greatest motivation to improve."</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, of the 123 million people had only a fraction than a problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">For people familiar with one another.</seg>
<seg id="210">"if trust works, it can create wonderland."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. there was also a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him into the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessing:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travellers, which is circumcised because of sitting operations to heart attack."</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with ample hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real protections that save one life, even though they do not have to know one at all."</seg>
<seg id="218">"they drive one in your own car into hospital, if you die, and wait, while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they do not want to feel lonely, they bring books past."</seg>
<seg id="220">They can even stay longer without charge the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course it does not run every stay.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money-action are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I first asked about this term, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is about an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but it is now simply to call" "lease" to name "" the thing is not righteous. "</seg>
<seg id="228">"share Economy describes a trade, human relationships promises."</seg>
<seg id="229">People put a part of themselves open and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">"if one gets today, that is fast food to compare. it is efficient and reliable, but for this less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">But what would travel be a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">"what would be when at any place you visited, a group there would wait, to complete a thorough and one in a pub-tour quarters of which one has never heard before."</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn Cooking of a five-star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">"nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy."</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to share apartments from the ground?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would this look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What would be the thoughts of shared thoughts of shared shared people?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that enable us to society and relationships instead of loneliness and frotation.</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korean capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking spaces, which was owned by the government,"</seg>
<seg id="240">Were offered to residence. students who were looking for a strikes were</seg>
<seg id="241">Were alleged to people whose children were educated and were started.</seg>
<seg id="242">"to finance new start-ups in the Share economy. about our platform alone, more than 1,000 people in 191 countries will be a guest at a stranger or even hosts."</seg>
<seg id="243">"so the idea seems to be not so crazy, as it was brought us."</seg>
<seg id="244">We have not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality there were also before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar sites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has just our work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from luck and timing, we know that you can find the right design with the components of the trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deeply rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find it amazing!</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it when a roter Mazda goes over to me.</seg>
<seg id="253">"of course, we know that design cannot solve any problem."</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us when it had this great influence, I ask myself what we can use design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you watch me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believing? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, a brain-laundering, a terrorist attack?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay at the security rate at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">"thus, the media people represent, which look like me."</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans mean that most would have no Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">"presumably, people do not speak to their Uber drivers."</seg>
<seg id="267">"for all those who have never met a Muslim: it's great, you meet."</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee owner -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted;</seg>
<seg id="271">A carrot-Fitness-fanatikerin, "</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga Singing, because, Baby, I was not so born."</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to have decided.</seg>
<seg id="275">"when I was 17 years old, I met the decision to ouched myself."</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as homosexual man, as some of my friends, but as Muslim. I decided to wear hijab, my head coverage."</seg>
<seg id="277">"my feminist friendships were inbreeding," "why do you oppressed yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the funny was, at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, and in contrast to the pressure that I felt as 17-year old, to adapt myself to a perfect and infinite beauty deal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents only.</seg>

<seg id="425">"however, there is always a box."</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of hedge-starters is that they were sensitive to turbulence such as wind bricks.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>

<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often provide basic abstract issues related to the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be for example: what is the petty-possible number of movable parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopter are known about as machines with a thousand movable parts that meet you to hurt.</seg>

<seg id="797">As most of my colleagues I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a heavy stroke or after a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgey it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, a very little ability to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a severe violation of the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disabilities."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I was functional neurosururgin.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional Neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"certainly they have heard of one of the most famous one of the" "Tiefenhirnication". "it implanted a electric de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons so that neurological function enhances."</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. she has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson, which suffered under the heaters and heavy pain. "</seg>
<seg id="806">"however, neuromodulation does not mean Neuro-healing."</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream working al neurosurgey is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">History began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was conducting Oberdentists and worked every day and night in the notion.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I put patients with skull traverse ttrauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that at skull-Hirn traumas and the skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">"to save life, you have to donate the skull pressure."</seg>
<seg id="816">"for this, one sometimes have to remove a part of swollen shepherd."</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of cast away, we decided to analyze with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the shepherds."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissues.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"to let cells grow from a tissue, it is comparable with very small children that are taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find the right diet, temperature, moisture and the environments to release them."</seg>
<seg id="823">Exactly that we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many publishers it Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">This saw it under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">It was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly as a stem cell culture. with large green cells that are surrounded by small, unmature cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you are still aware of the biologic lessons that stem cells unripe cells can turn into each cell type of organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain does stem cells, but very few. you are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells stopped different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They are very slowly and after a couple of weeks she even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, weird cell population which looked like stem cells, but it was different."</seg>
<seg id="837">"we needed long, to understand what they came."</seg>
<seg id="838">It originates from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are hot Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">You make 4% of our main hiring boards.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus they ensure the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brainviolations."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">"however, one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells."</seg>
<seg id="849">"we stand in front of a potential cell source, the braid division."</seg>
<seg id="850">This had to prove.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">"we wanted a piece of brainths from the non-linguistic area, and then the cells can be as cultivate as it Jean-François did."</seg>
<seg id="853">And they subsequently mark colour to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we traveled them at the confiscation of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autonomous transplantation -- Autotransplant.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we traveled these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we traveled the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we could work with monkey.</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we traveled the cells into a healthy brain, and we watched that they had been removed after a few weeks when they were sent back home. the room is already occupied, they will not used there, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">"in the second scenario we released a breach and reiplanted the same cells, and now the cells remain strikes to mature neurons."</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you can see what we could watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were traveled.</seg>
<seg id="862">"evidence they show, these small points are these small points. these are the cells that we were in vitro, in the culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Help these cells also have a ape to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual activity.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets of one tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they achieved a stable action level, we last for the motoric Cortex in the Handmotorik area."</seg>
<seg id="869">"finally the monkeys were paralysed, they could not move their hand anymore."</seg>
<seg id="870">"as it would happen to people, they recovered spontaneously up to some extent, just like after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then try to recover with the help of plastical brain mechanisms. they recover to some degree, just as with the monkey. "</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were sure that the Aefs had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, implanted its own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you see the monkey which spontaneously relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original performance prior to the injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now, see as we traveled the cells, the same apaces, two months after the maturity."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since this time we have found much more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can use them freezing and later use.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use them in other neuropathological models, for example at Parkinson."</seg>
<seg id="881">"however, our dream is still to implant them to implant."</seg>
<seg id="882">I genuinely hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives the means to heal yourself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne that is wonderful, I'm sure that just several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think:" I know someone who need that. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question of what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials in human beings."</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. proceeding from these great results you have to fill about two kilograms papers and forms to run this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable that the brain is very delicate etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">"Jb: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look into the future -- You have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials, how many years lasts until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">Jb: this is difficult to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of the clinical study."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow ourselves to start the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it has a long time to choose the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, one has to apply this to a multi-centric study."</seg>
<seg id="897">One has to really point out that it is useful before you can offer this treatment.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is certain of course. Jb: natural.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne that thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a great mistake to consider it as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that it is in reality, but as inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider it as an immutable contradictory.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism necessarily leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great neighbor in Beijing have undoubtedly proved, that it is quite possible to have an blooming capitalism and impressive growth while politics is completely undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"indeed, democracy at us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was declared that the democratic process of our country -- our elections - not to influence austerity, which were realised in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at this moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my sincerely friends told me that democracy would be abolished."</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you to believe in together with me, that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a Irrbelieve, we could save the democracy, but that we need a truly and defender democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"for without democracy, our societies are engaged in our future, and our great, new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of waste, I would like to point you on an interesting contradiction that is currently our tavern."</seg>
<seg id="915">"I call it the" "Zwilingsgiapples-paradox." ""</seg>
<seg id="916">"a summit is known to you. they know and recognize it as the debt hill, who throws up his long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"all of us recognize the Schuldenberg,"</seg>
<seg id="918">Yet few recognize his twilling.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which is part of anxious austerity and corporations, which would be to anxious where it would be productive and income, with which one could be productive and also provide all the things that humanity is urgently needed, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I ask them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"in the past 3 months were invested in the United States, in England and the Eurozone, in all its prosperity producing goods, such as industrial installations, machines, office buildings, schools, cars, equipment, and so on and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3.4 trons US dollars, after a lot of money, until one gets comparisons with the 5,1 trillion dollars, which came at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing, except the stock exchange rates and the real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus, debts and unproductive capital make the Gemillingsgiapples, which is not out of the usual market mechanism."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result are stagnating wages, more than a quarter of 25-54 years, and consequently, a low cost-economic demand, which could not invest in which they would not invest. just like oedipus Father, who is not afraid that his son would kill him if he will grow,"</seg>
<seg id="925">"undisputed the circumstances, which lead to that eco-pus him kills."</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my haer with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"its extremely difficult art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, human talents continue to develop and particularly all the technologies to finance," green "technologies, which are decisive for saving the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">So democracy is the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I already believe. but before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the company form in which the free and arms control the poor as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The athic democracy included too many from --</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be an error, the importance of athic democracy due to that outlines."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decision on the athic democracy was and is that it was not only the right to freedom of expression, and not only the right to freedom of expression, but more importantly, and defining them the right to political cosizing in questions of government bodies."</seg>
<seg id="935">Athic democracy has not been kept long --</seg>
<seg id="936">"as a candle, the very bright lights, it is also fast spread."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our contemporary liberal democracies have not their roots in the ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while athic democracy focused on the free citizens and the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for prevailing."</seg>
<seg id="940">"liberal democracy only came upon as a complete separation between politics and economy, and the democratic process has been incorporated into politics, while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- a democratically-free zone was established."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our today's democracies, since the time in which this separation between politics and economy began, an unprecedented struggle between the two by the economy gradually migrant politicians and they deed."</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wonder why politicians do not have any more such as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not at a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is that one cannot be in the government nowadays and still not in power because the power of politics into the economy is divided into the economy.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hadern with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is about as a flock of robbers who has so sustainable the animals, from which they are nourished, declined to the end therefore."</seg>
<seg id="947">"similarly, it is related to the economy which the politics has become so far cannibbles, that it grows due to the self-induced economic crisis itself, the power of corporations grows, economic demand falls and the managing director of corporations have to be sarded to invest the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful capitalism of the" Demos "" [the people] out of democracy, the higher the compillingsgiapples, and the greater the waste of human labour power and welfare of humanity. "</seg>
<seg id="949">"if that is true, it is obvious that we have to bring the policy and the economy, and it would be better if the" demos "control remains, apart from the exclusion of slaves, the women and the foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist linke had this idea already 100 years ago and it did not seem to be good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the Debakel of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor is restored only through a miracle like in ancient Athens without creating new species of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by being replaced by Niedrigrewarding by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is to be so long economy and politics separate areas, the automation of Gemillingsgiapples can be higher, the waste management, and the social conflicts deeper, as it is already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we have to redesign the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and thereby pay attention to the reunion area, otherwise we will let the movie" matrix "like a documentation."</seg>
<seg id="957">"so, the question is not whether capitalism has the technical achievements that he has brought to survive --"</seg>
<seg id="958">"the most interesting question is whether capitalism is going through a dyno, similar to the" matrix "," in which machines serve man and people put their energy into the research of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athener "Agora," in long talks on the meaning of life. "</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"so what does it look, how could it look like this" star Trek "" armature utopia instead of the "matrix" -similar dystopie? "</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation I would like to give you, in all soon, some examples."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the field of companies: ask for a capital market, where you have money earned, while you work and in which your capital is going to you from one company to the next, and the company -- regardless of which one is currently working -- is property of those who currently work in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital and from arousal and the concept of wage labor is completely outdated.</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the companies but do not work in it, and employees who are working there. no expulling out between capital and labour, no major gaps between investment and spheres, and ultimately not a raging twins."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy: please make sure that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest gay countries], in the interest of the whole of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"furthermore, you continue to trap that the entire world bank in this currency will be traded -- we call it" "Cosmos" "in units of" cosmos "" -- and every government pays the sum that represents the commercial deficit or the surplus-surplus from the respective country into a common fund. "</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund is investing in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world, in which investment."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes was proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time one had not put the technical means at that time.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have them, especially in the background of a reunited politics and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world, which I describe them at the same time, at the same time, and Marxist, because they buried the separation of capital and labour in Mülste of the story, and keynesian, global keynesian."</seg>
<seg id="973">"but above all others, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we put in a "matrix" - similar Dyspie?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide in politically politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography itself as a liberal Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I just said, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... doing this, the technological development will generate such massive decline in the overall economic demand, what Larry Summers is referred to as" long term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"through the transmission of this crisis from a part of the earth to the next, as we're currently experiencing it is not only our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is applicable, then Marx is quite relevant."</seg>
<seg id="986">"just like Hayek, therefore I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and that is why I am completely wirr."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: in fact, and now we are at ease."</seg>
<seg id="988">"YV: if you are not wirr, you do not think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein that said to Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers, you have very clear what you think of the view of the West in China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the startion of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my presentation, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of the economy -- a completely democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in some respects, when I must say so provocative, similar China today the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"for -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism to democracy -- this is a mistake, historically considered."</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">"he was particularly skeptical, which concerns the democratic development."</seg>
<seg id="998">"what one can observe in China now, similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"China now preferable to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells huge to hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">"BG: I am sure that many listeners was curious to your experiences as a financial minister of Greece at the beginning of the year."</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I think that this comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How are you looking for six months later on the first half-year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the euro zone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely to adopt us from self-sufficiency, and the continuous denial-denial which went out through the eurozone and continues to massively threatening the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- the way, the first suggestion was that this denial was revealed --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately it is right to do. unfortunately, the powers within the Eurozone, within the European group, continue to denied the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know yes what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if one tries to get an economic system, which is not convincing, through political will and authoritarianism in life, it might be hesitated, but if the change occurs, he happens abrupt and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes are you looking ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have the future if we do not change its construction.</seg>

<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest mistake was to sign the request for the extension of the school programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest in the donors to find a common solution.</seg>

<seg id="1038">"by Roy Price, most of them have never heard, although he is probably responsible for 22-moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">"probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for many of you."</seg>
<seg id="1040">"this goes back to the decision, the Roy had three years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a leading class at Amazon Studios.</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-Production company of Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has a icons and describes on Twitter as" movies, TV, technology, tacos. "</seg>
<seg id="1044">"Roy has a very important job, because he is responsible for this, shows the shows and the content that will produce Amazon."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard-fighting industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy cannot select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he has to find shows, which are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words he must find shows that are right on this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the application distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDb site. the assessment goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review receive.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"will make your show with nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows how" Breaking Bad, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows, the sweet, where, after one has a season, your brain asks," where are there more of this episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left hand side, here at this end, are shows how" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- -- this should tell you enough what goes to that end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not worry about the left side of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to teach "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts about the middle balance, the average television -- the shows, which are neither good nor bad they do not delight them."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must ensure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is present, and of course it is the first time making Amazon as something that's why Roy Is nothing risky."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he holds a contest."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and are chosen by an evaluation eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts it online, where they can watch any free of charge."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon wouldn't matter something else, you can still comprehend?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators look at this episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they are observed when viewing this shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team who will pick up everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you capture, when to start the show when you are condensed, which parts you can skipped and again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">Collect millions of data to decide with these data that show them should be produced.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact they collect the data, process these and this gives the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a sitcom about four Republican U.S. senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made these show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that don't seem to remember that show because it was not so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is only one average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- as the average of this curve 7,4 is and Alpha House lanes at 7,5 -- so somewhat above average, but not exactly what is wording on Roy and his team."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"about at the same time at another company, another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. its name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of Netflix. just like Roy he is always looking for it to find these a super show and it also uses data for it but it makes it a little different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of contemplating a competition, he and his team will give up the existing data about the Netflix spectators, so the ratings they give the shows whose course shows them, which shows they like etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then use these data to find these little details of the spectators: what shows they like, what producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they entered a wagon and decided to do not have a sitcom about four senators, but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards ". Netflix has taken a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 rating on this curve. so, exactly where they wanted. "</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course is the question: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very unpetitive, data sealed companies. "</seg>
<seg id="1082">They combine these many data with each other and it works super for one of them but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is it?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because the logic exists somehow that all should work in all.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if one collects millions of data for a decision that one meets, then you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years of statistics as Back-Up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized with very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"Mindfulness what you can expect, is good television, or?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis does not work, then this is something frightening, because we live in a time in which we attack more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Knows someone here the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"no. OK, that is even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">"multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one comes in this room in touch with this software. come in touch with it, you are in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in prison in prison and for discharge, it is probably that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal is done or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"but as with Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad, will be decided whether a person is good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate television, 22 minutes, that may be genuine bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that these data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always created the best results. this is not that a company like multi-health system does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data is also reversible.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google does sometimes make mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"2009, Google announced that they can tell through data analysis breakouts of flu, the schlimmen type, predictions -- by data analysis of Google Search."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked fine and was a great news sensation. the success story was published in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked impeccable, year round the year, until it suddenly won't work more functional,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it worked simply not, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data diversified companies such as Amazon and Google misunderstandings are sometimes something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all of these errors data in decisions of life a -- on the workplace, in the place of law, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">"so, we would prefer to ensure that data are helpful."</seg>
<seg id="1108">"also, I have many difficulties with data. I work in the computer-based genetics -- an area where some very clever people inconceivable many data to make serious decisions, as the decision for a cancer therapy"</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medication. over the years I recognized some patterns over the difference between successful decisions using data and no successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"you have to solve a complex problem, do they mainly do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"as a first, you put this problem into its parts, so that you can analyze the parts; as a branch, you put the parts again to take a resolution."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: apart and set up again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help create a problem and understand his parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not able to reate the parts again and then come to a resolution.</seg>
<seg id="1116">For this there is a different tool and we possess it all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"when there is something in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces again to summarize, even if the information is incomplete to grasp a good resolution -- especially when it is the brain's brain."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I believe I was Netflix so successful because they have used data and mind, where they are also executed in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience, where else they would not have been able. but the decision on how to put all these parts, and make it a show like" House of Cards "," which was not in the data. "</seg>
<seg id="1120">"Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they entered a big personal risk with this decision."</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon others did so on the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first as they winted for TV-ideas, then as she chose" Alpha House "as show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they could always say: "they tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe that things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerfully they are, data are just a tool, and not to forget that this device is fairly useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"it is also called" "Magic 8 Ball". it is amazing. for decisions using a ja- or no question you need to shake the ball, to get an answer. "highly likely" -- just here in this moment. "</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will return it later with a technar demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far, I have made some decisions taken in my life, whereby I could have heard in the ball on the ball."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace it by something much exchanged, such as data analysis, to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"thus, perhaps the ball clamp and klüger. ultimately, it is possible to make decisions to make decisions when we want to achieve something exceptional at the end of the right corner."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as very encouraging message that despite the great amount of data still pays off, decisions to meet, an expert in what you do is doing and risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"in the end, it is not the data, but the risks associated with which you land at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks nice.</seg>
