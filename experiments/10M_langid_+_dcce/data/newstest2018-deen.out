&quot; Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards , which change your view to the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt where young people should meet young people today .
a greeting block where now for the S @-@ Bahn .
small @-@ garden@@ ers are the cause of farmers .
the oldest official card coin encourages exciting stories to days .
it nervous if land@@ ing cards are not up to date .
&quot; this knows everyone who had to rain yourself , because the Auto @-@ Nav@@ i run instead of a transformation road to a green meadow . &quot;
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bayern of the State Government , everything else is up to date - but especially very reve@@ aling . &quot;
especially when you compar@@ es them with current online cards .
&quot; then , the towns and municipalities are changed in the spread @-@ area of the Mün@@ ch@@ ner Merk@@ ur since the 19th century . &quot;
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is an Flick@@ ent@@ epp@@ ich one sees as such as such .
&quot; in the large picture postcard , for cities and churches have detailed maps , so @-@ called pre@@ fabric@@ ation leaves . &quot;
this origin@@ ates according to the information of the Bayer@@ ische Hoch@@ mess@@ ing management between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and ski@@ p the first verse of Bay@@ ern@@ s .
your Client : Napoleon .
the French He@@ er@@ es@@ leader settled in Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Ko@@ ali@@ tion@@ ality of Austria .
Napoleon had an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographical survey of Bay@@ ern@@ s in order - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even if the French troops mar@@ ched with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from 9 February 18@@ 01 , the present neighbours were created with the idea of a surface @-@ end Bayern map . &quot;
Kur@@ für@@ st Max I@@ V. Joseph tri@@ eb continued the project on the &quot; top@@ ographical Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bayer@@ ische Constitu@@ tional administration .
the Ur@@ posi@@ tions@@ blatt for Munich comes from 18@@ 56 and is like to find all other information on the Bayer@@ ische Land@@ ced@@ bli@@ otec@@ a .
the comparison to Fru@@ it / Today is the example of the provin@@ cial capital at the lon@@ ern@@ most .
the city has stret@@ ched itself into all directions and has grown together .
&quot; an example for this is sub@@ mis@@ ling , which is still relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 . &quot;
&quot; ship@@ ling was formed 21 years after the creation of the map , i.e. 1877 , as a Mün@@ ch@@ ner district . &quot;
today under@@ send@@ ling is in the middle of the city .
&quot; the houses under@@ rate focus around 18@@ 56 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ strasse , which was named after 1878 to Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the Bav@@ arian peasants against Austria 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing as a fields - at the first glance : when adding a smaller @-@ piece map with do@@ zen lines and numbers : hand@@ written number@@ ed Fl@@ ur@@ pieces from the so called &quot; &quot; origin &quot; , &quot; which was derived from the basic tax . &quot;
small pitches take place here today no farmers more - but small garden@@ er of the plant in the sun .
a large green area stands out north of sub@@ lime .
&quot; the ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese in the 19th century , was actually a meadow - and no emphasis on the 19th century . &quot;
on the other side of the Is@@ ar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psych@@ iat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; in the field of the current district A@@ u @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen is not only reads the road name &quot; &quot; Gast@@ eig &quot; &quot; or from the height &quot; &quot; On the ventilation , &quot; but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ str . we once met people with mad@@ ness . &quot;
there was 18@@ 58 / 59 the Mün@@ ch@@ ner District @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anst@@ alt &quot; On the Au@@ er aer@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; from 1872 accompanying Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den the institution - that psych@@ iat@@ r@@ ater , who is brought into connection with the death of King Lud@@ wi@@ gs . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time and ended , for example the pres@@ idency of the so @-@ called error . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he is prohibited to address the personnel , violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has worked for an exhibition with the An@@ st@@ age . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients had been at first place , later on 500 seats was enlarged . &quot;
some@@ time this capacity is no longer - the reason for the construction of the cra@@ y@@ iel@@ ded old in hair 1905 .
&quot; there is since 2006 the Is@@ ar @-@ AM@@ PER @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ East , one of the largest stra@@ ins of Germany . &quot;
in the area of former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt meet young people at the Mün@@ ch@@ ner Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the Or@@ den war@@ b the building complex 1920 and turned him into a youth hostel with ap@@ prentic@@ es@@ hips .
&quot; West is located west of the TS@@ V Munich east , east of residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; 2015 , one set up the children &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; - in architectural approach to the origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ anst@@ alt , which was destroyed during World War II during the Second World War . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was in around 18@@ 56 as &quot; main square &quot; , &quot; the Kauf@@ ing@@ erst@@ raße was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War in the heart of mouth .
the bom@@ bs of the Al@@ lied ris@@ sen in December 1944 many holes in the inner city .
a big continued until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
&quot; the German Institute , small business houses and a pit stop from the Middle Ages stood once at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days were the pre @-@ work and will be done on 5 April 2017 , for the second S @-@ Bahn path . &quot;
&quot; with the sli@@ der , the old Munich @-@ card can be compared to the air@@ picture of today - and the hole at the Mari@@ enhof . &quot;
citizen group published travel war@@ n for Miss@@ ouri
the National Association for the promotion of colour@@ ants has issued a warning for colored people who travel on discri@@ min@@ atory policies and the rac@@ ist attacks by the State of Miss@@ ouri .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the federal state Miss@@ ouri , which shall rise up until 28 August 2017 , call for A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American travelers , visitors and Miss@@ our@@ i@@ aner because a number of frag@@ ments , rac@@ en@@ based inci@@ dent occurr@@ ing in recent times throughout the state and here are noted , &quot; says it in the opinion of the group . &quot;
&quot; a recent adopted law of Miss@@ ouri , which makes people serious power , discrimination measures , as well as the prosec@@ ution authorities of the state , di@@ spro@@ por@@ tion@@ ate on minorities , the di@@ spro@@ por@@ tion@@ ate the group of war@@ fare , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
&quot; they have happen violations of civil rights , people happen . &quot;
&quot; they are raised because of their skin colour , they are be@@ aten or killed , &quot; said the President of the Miss@@ ouri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear dis@@ comfort in such a frequency that we have not yet heard .
it is the first such warning which has issued the organization for a state in the United States .
&quot; the group c@@ ited inci@@ dents such as raci@@ al decre@@ ases against black students at the University of Miss@@ ouri and death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ enn@@ es@@ see . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ anders died in the beginning of the year after having been no gas@@ oline anymore during the journey through the state , and taken by the police of Miss@@ ouri in awareness , without a Crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also points to a recent official report of the Office of the General Conference of Miss@@ ouri , which is shown that black drivers in the state is 75 percent more common than wh@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and their families , friends and staff will inform about what could happen in Miss@@ ouri &quot; , &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
people need to be ready whether it will bring Kau@@ ts@@ i or let the relatives know that they travel through the state .
&quot; Miss@@ ouri for@@ ded in 2015 100 H@@ ass@@ scre@@ am , according to the latest figures from the H@@ ass@@ verb@@ right correction programme of the F@@ BI , which in relation to the number of such injury to the 16th rank of the country . &quot;
&quot; the itinerary is also an answer to a new Miss@@ ouri law , which would make it more difficult , a company due to housing or employment discrimination . &quot;
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ LU ) travel war@@ nings for Texas and Arizona , after the States immig@@ rant legislation passed the local prosec@@ ution authorities to assume people because of immigration . &quot;
travel war@@ nings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries but at last time interest groups have been employed in response to certain laws and trends within the US .
We@@ de@@ z@@ aun@@ ts@@ project is Elem@@ ental
the Fisch@@ erb@@ acher Wei@@ de@@ z@@ au@@ n @-@ Project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U @-@ Bund@@ est@@ ag@@ enten Peter Weiss und Kor@@ dul@@ a Kov@@ ac have provided a picture on site .
&quot; at the spell of the family pi@@ dem@@ ann met the representative of the her@@ edit@@ ary CD@@ U , together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members . &quot;
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ dem@@ ann granted first insights into his farm , in which he has 55 hectares meadows and 40 hectares of forest , and 40 hectares of wood supplies and also housed in five apartments &apos;s holiday houses . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Black &quot; &quot; is for him the altern@@ ativ@@ eless mark@@ eter for the milk of his cows , so pi@@ dem@@ ann . &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ees only Reg@@ ion@@ ales comes exclusively in regional .
&quot; as he is also BL@@ H@@ V Chairman of fishing bach , he referred to the past@@ oral project as &quot; el@@ ac@@ el@@ ist . &quot; &quot;
I can not compens@@ ate on der@@ art areas not c@@ ited economy .
&quot; the green area care for much work , much to be dealt with with the motor sense . &quot;
&quot; we have been struggling with the terms and conditions and with the Top@@ ics , &quot; says Schwen@@ dem@@ ann . &quot;
in 2003 he took over the el@@ ementary operation and cro@@ ps these without chemical plant protection and ferti@@ liz@@ ers even if he will not lead a bio@@ operation .
&quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; the Commun@@ e recognised the meaning of the past@@ ure research project , and is pleased to support the leader . &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euro per hect@@ are would have to be supported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that the for@@ estation of the surfaces could still be taken out for quite a while . &quot;
&quot; the greatest treasure we have , the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts on how they continue to bring her operation , &quot; stressed the may@@ or . &quot;
farmers are often expressed in criticism
over the past@@ oral funding were fenced in 2013 a total of 25 plots from eleven nations .
the disclosure area is thus 40 hectares that may not be recorded until at least 2023 .
&quot; from the overall cost of 71 500 Euro the half costs was funded by the leader , a quarter carried the municipality of Fis@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus the farmers had 12 610 euros , they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 km of Wei@@ de@@ z@@ au@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; said Schwen@@ dem@@ ann . &quot;
Kor@@ dul@@ a Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and land@@ ing it doesn &apos;t go . &quot;
also for Peter Weiss stood firm : &quot; here are best food produced . &quot;
the Land@@ sc@@ rap @-@ linear ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state promotion of Wei@@ de@@ zä@@ unen .
goal is the disclosure of the Black Forest .
prerequisite is the presence of one of the L@@ PR be@@ zz@@ led conveyor belt .
&quot; in addition , the appropriate area may not be in@@ sufficient ( land@@ mark above 35 percent ) and must be threatened by the for@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; for the Fisch@@ erb@@ acher Wei@@ de@@ z@@ aun@@ ts@@ project 2018 is currently running the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build a short of 16 kilometers . &quot;
the disclosure area corresponds to 35 hectares , the cal@@ yp@@ ulated costs are more than 112 000 . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp takes the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est character of a regime change is it when they begin to att@@ ain the stat@@ ues .
&quot; the Americans appreciate this as any other - therefore the care@@ ely ins@@ ulated storm Sadd@@ am H@@ uss@@ one at the Fir@@ ing place in Bag@@ hd@@ ad in 2003 . &quot;
&quot; Stephen Mill@@ er , one of the key ide@@ olo@@ gues of the Tru@@ mp regime , knew sure what he did , when he took a symbo@@ lic battle with Jim Aco@@ sta of CN@@ N on the proposals of the President to the dr@@ astic limitation of illegal immigration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
to remain fair but Mill@@ er does not have the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boot@@ land@@ owners and Liberty Im@@ it@@ ators would have suffered it if he had done it .
&quot; but he laid down their significance , and in particular the meaning that it was written , when the famous po@@ em of Emma Laz@@ arus 1903 , 17 years after completion of the monument . &quot;
&quot; when Mill@@ er Aco@@ sta ar@@ im@@ ed : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a full thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... an icon of American freedom , that the world is illumin@@ ated . &quot;
the po@@ em that you refer to which later was added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty .
&quot; Mill@@ er is knowled@@ geable , but as he formed it itself , it is not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary reson@@ ance on the elabor@@ ate words of Laz@@ arus , the only ones where a state is not only any old immig@@ rants , but the hass@@ les of the poor : &quot; &quot; your arms , your arms , / your bed@@ y masses , who like to breathe free to breathe , / the def@@ ending ab@@ fall of your rich coast . &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; el@@ ementary waste &quot; on our scre@@ ens was better to see .
Mill@@ er con@@ stitut@@ ed not in liter@@ ary criticism - he clearly made that these people are not welcome in Tru@@ mp@@ s USA .
this conflict due to the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural confront@@ ation : it is indeed a conflict in the significance of America .
Laz@@ arus - and her friends who set up their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they had taken a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American repub@@ lic@@ anism by being presented in a sec@@ lu@@ ded classic imaging display the female em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of freedom .
Laz@@ arus changed this meaning : in her po@@ em is the feminine figure out of no longer tr@@ act - it has obtained a voice .
and there is itself a very different name : mother of Ex@@ il@@ ants .
the connection of the sex with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist Cou@@ p and a dev@@ ast@@ ating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and exactly how Laz@@ arus changed the importance of the statue , the people wanted to return from the right wing this already for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the big scre@@ ens as Rus@@ h Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Bap@@ tist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , ar@@ gu@@ ed 2010 , that the Statue of Liberty was not one , but rather an early neo @-@ conserv@@ ative , but rather an early neo @-@ conserv@@ ative world is going ahead : &quot; Lady Liberty goes forward . &quot;
it shall bear the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch is not to enlight@@ en the way to the United States . &quot;
quite unusual is li@@ bau@@ gh here on something st@@ olen .
the significance of the statue is quite and certainly a matter of perception of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Laz@@ arus consi@@ sted of Laz@@ arus to see how it was seen from the ex@@ haus@@ tive , but hop@@ eful people have seen after long and often terrible jour@@ neys on the de@@ cks of ships . &quot;
&quot; it is in the tru@@ est way to see the world from the perspective of people , seek re@@ fu@@ ge and to improve a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and of the welcome that they have to hear .
and this is of course not the perspective that Mill@@ er and Tru@@ mp ever wish to recognise .
&quot; your tor@@ ch is not to illumin@@ ate the way , but the hat@@ red , who is their only source of power , spont@@ ane@@ ously . &quot;
world championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black lo@@ bt &apos;s members of the team of Great Britain
E@@ ili@@ dh Do@@ yle re@@ minds of a time when only two scre@@ ams belong@@ ed to the team of Great Britain
&quot; the audi@@ tor of the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ four @-@ dro@@ pl@@ tic contro@@ versi@@ es in the World Championships is a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish ath@@ letes was selected for London 2017 which starts on Friday .
&quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; in Scotland has been something special &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom has to learn from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand and we will continue it until we find it &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot;
I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think that it has something to do with what they have done .
the sch@@ ot@@ tic ath@@ letes think that it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the guy on the corner .
whatever the combination of the circumstances is absolutely brilliant .
&quot; several of the sch@@ ot@@ tic Ath@@ l@@ eten are med@@ als presented , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - the fight against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5.000 m distance , while E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle was elected by the team of the team &apos;s team . &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ dh is pretty mod@@ est .
&quot; your capit@@ als speech was incredible , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of ath@@ letes , whether they were sch@@ ot@@ tically or wherever they live or exercise , went out of space and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the real feeling , the E@@ ili@@ dh was very natural , of course were great . &quot;
&quot; the Common@@ wealth @-@ silver med@@ alli@@ ons , who is in her fifth World Championships for the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; &quot; that 16 car@@ rots in the British team . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s best total number of ath@@ letes at the World Championships was seven , the 1983 and 2015 were achieved . &quot;
the middle @-@ run@@ ners Mu@@ ir leads on this road and last year five British and two European records .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,@@ 500 m and 5,000 m away . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , the 1,@@ 500 m runs , is another shot of a great season that should be observed in the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games . &quot;
the Do@@ yle re@@ minds of her first World Championships as the only other cont@@ actor in the team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
&quot; the Mann@@ or@@ ts chapter says that they are &quot; great pride &quot; to the fact that many of their land@@ ings do not only belong to the team , but in some cases also with the med@@ als and the fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the Fe@@ atured in this team is to be elected that she was elected by the other members of the team so that there was anyway a great honour , but to know that my team of team was voted for me and have chosen it to something special for me , added them . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the vill@@ i who belong to the team . &quot;
it only shows how far we come .
&quot; and they are here as an established ath@@ letes , ath@@ letes , who want to rise on po@@ di@@ ums . &quot;
what my speech as a capit@@ als concerned ?
&quot; yes , I think it was good . &quot;
&quot; I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , as we have a home World Championship . &quot;
so it is really important to put on these home support and benefit from it that we are back at the Olympi@@ ast@@ adi@@ on .
I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere there .
blo@@ cking the cri@@ tics on Facebook : get you not a public office if you can &apos;t wear the char@@ ity of voters .
the Father of our country knew something of poor press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it lasted not long until the newspapers made him because of all , from the internal politics up to his political principles . &quot;
&quot; he sh@@ iel@@ ded in criticism , safe . &quot;
but he did not put his cri@@ tics to silence .
&quot; for in 17@@ 83 Washington : &quot; &quot; the freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stup@@ id and st@@ um@@ m we will be guided as the sheep for batt@@ les . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to govern@@ or Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an , who has to work more like Washington . &quot;
Ho@@ go@@ ose &apos;s employees have block@@ ed the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union def@@ ended him therefore at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the start of the govern@@ or dism@@ is@@ sed the law@@ suit as fri@@ v@@ ol , and the online comment was full of a backl@@ ash with &quot; Na , and ? &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is particularly important when it is a guy like H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; this is a Repub@@ li@@ an@@ ic govern@@ or in an overwhelming democratic state , which is amazing . &quot;
he has the second bed approval of the 50 Govern@@ or of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary Hit@@ z@@ head .
he demonstrated a fixed hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with principles .
he was also very sent to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with its constitu@@ ents and playing his ha@@ ired head to chem@@ otherapy upon his side .
&quot; therefore , the block@@ boards of persons who come to the side of the govern@@ or - which is a public forum , which is considered to be officially paid by public tax Dollars - un@@ necessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post def@@ ended Ho@@ elia speaker of Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse the acts of the govern@@ or , ar@@ gu@@ ed that the block@@ age of the comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; but it is too simple , the image of sc@@ roll or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ asser@@ tive people to use online the wh@@ ist@@ le schw@@ ingen . &quot;
the post spoke with some of the real people who were block@@ ed by H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; and these are only real people who speak with their chosen leadership : a teacher , a ent@@ repren@@ eur and a priest , no sc@@ roll . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments respect@@ fully , thought@@ fully and not prof@@ an . &quot;
the past@@ or c@@ ited the Bible in his post and app@@ elli@@ ot@@ ed to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
&quot; lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani by Bo@@ like , MD . , was not h@@ asser@@ tive , but she asked for H@@ ass@@ th@@ breaking . &quot;
&quot; I loved polite , that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to h@@ ass@@ ing and other current messages , she wrote in the commentary area of the message &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate this idea even if a number of people percei@@ ve the same issue , then they are percei@@ ved by some more than such a common collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the employees of the govern@@ or as &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; would be other probably &quot; &quot; inter@@ ce@@ de &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Facebook @-@ era makes it easy to get a message by simply , by simply a cri@@ tics or deleted a negative comment . &quot;
&quot; it is much clean@@ er than in early times when one had done the same that employees were det@@ ri@@ fied to collect papers with critical conduc@@ tors and to burn or prot@@ esters , and to swe@@ eping to silence . &quot;
but just that happens just digital .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public officials which he cri@@ tici@@ zed that it has Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp is charged by Twitter @-@ users who were block@@ ed by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question was the last week in Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County Pre@@ last the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to US @-@ District Apostle James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when she called a voters from her Facebook @-@ site . &quot;
&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Govern@@ or received Matt Be@@ in ( R ) also a visit of the AC@@ LU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
this should not be so heavy .
at the time of Washington had the time of affordable por@@ tos such as the Internet .
&quot; the number of newspapers negl@@ ected between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letter to his leadership . &quot;
and even at that time Washington was anonymous T@@ roll .
&quot; the people , the p@@ seud@@ ony@@ ms like &quot; &quot; J@@ uri@@ cola &quot; , &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us &quot; , &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers , the Wash@@ ing@@ tons decisions made . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions , who cri@@ tici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and the boat trip with Great Britain , according to the historical documents that were collected by the Online Papers of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he did not have brought them to silence .
freedom of expression and dis@@ course include the basis of our nation .
and true leadership means that to accept .
Ron@@ an Ra@@ ffer@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
&quot; the former Europeans No. 1 Ron@@ an Ra@@ ffer@@ ty will hope in the next three days at the local comfort , since the Renaissance club will be held in East lot@@ to the 25th issue of Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; Nor@@ di@@ re , which led last year next year in the Ar@@ cher@@ field links to the En@@ dr@@ aug@@ hts , before he joined by Paul E@@ ales , with the new Australian place and acts as a tournament winner in the name of the Club @-@ founder and CE@@ O@@ s Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he reaches his glory with this event , &quot; &quot; Ra@@ ffer@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from his best side , he is in a great condition . &quot;
Jerry has done a great job when he set this place .
he is an inher@@ ent author of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great show@@ case for this course . &quot;
&quot; German E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a championship in his 32 @-@ year career , although he won the European tour as well as the European Challenge Tour . &quot;
&quot; this really feels particularly , &quot; said that in South@@ port heated players . &quot;
&quot; I did not defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open not defend it in the year , after I had gained it out of the program . &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories of the last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on , last year here . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year to the European Senior tour , returns to the promotion at home . &quot;
this event will be his first step @-@ down performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to make it well , but you feel also this additional print . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing back and I played a solid golf .
I am pleased about how it has gone .
&quot; with the trio on the field are the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Bro@@ adh@@ urst , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ulty . &quot;
&quot; Or@@ r and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six bow@@ els on the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ros@@ s Dru@@ m@@ mond . &quot;

in the past two decades fewer people died because of passive exposure to lung cancer .
to this outcome scientists of the University of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ ke ) in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates are due to my estimates a year 167 pneum@@ onia falls on pas@@ v@@ smoke . , &quot; said Prospective leaders Hei@@ ko B@@ echer . &quot;
&quot; when compared , he moved his own study on this subject from 1994 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , there have been some 400 lung cancer for pas@@ siv@@ ity per year in Germany . &quot;
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
met@@ ronom@@ es prove to be very complex

&quot; the traffic , which is always disabled again , represents a big problem for the components of St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the Ig@@ nor@@ ance of the drivers in front of red amp@@ lif@@ iers and shut @-@ off @-@ g@@ it@@ ters is already huge , &quot; &quot; Hein@@ ze &quot; . &quot; &quot;

poverty and death in the ind@@ on@@ esian Gold@@ land
&quot; when B@@ ard@@ ina Deg@@ ei the dinner cooked , they use no cook@@ er . &quot;
it even uses rarely a pot .
&quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ age in the un@@ quiet ind@@ on@@ esian province Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife is usually called a swe@@ ar off@@ al - locally as &quot; not@@ a &quot; &quot; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour the fo@@ ol@@ ish Kn@@ ol@@ le will be extr@@ acted , im@@ puri@@ fied hands and dec@@ eased . &quot;
Deg@@ ei is sitting on the L@@ ehm@@ boden - she has no furniture - where she also performs their daily work , e.g. clothes with tr@@ il@@ be@@ m water from the nearby Sum@@ mon to wash . &quot;
a bucket in a hom@@ eless room serves as a latex she@@ ar .
as the youn@@ gest of the four wives of their man they were not assigned any fields .
Poly@@ gam@@ ie is common here .
&quot; of course , late to work can be dangerous : most vill@@ enti@@ ner are un@@ employed , and many drink heavy , and there are the soldiers . &quot;
&quot; nobody w@@ ails it , after 17 am in the village &quot; &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the highlands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , was recorded in Indonesia after a contro@@ versi@@ al referendum held by a public h@@ ander@@ ing before the occup@@ ying instrument . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , created for the independence against the Dutch rule , turned out quickly against the government of Jak@@ arta , which holds control over the region and includes foreign journalists or legal not@@ ebook . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially divided in Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , whereby the independent part of Pap@@ ua Neu@@ gu@@ ine@@ as was the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as sec@@ lu@@ ded as it &apos;s . the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provin@@ cial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a mor@@ row 5 @-@ hour drive with the car .
there is no public means of transport .
&quot; the city with approximately 19.@@ 000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , surrounded by bam@@ bus@@ is@@ sa@@ unen , and from cor@@ rug@@ ated roofs , which were converted by r@@ ust in various gel@@ b@@ brown t@@ ints . &quot;
&quot; very few Indonesian have made their journey here , because journalists and practically no for@@ eig@@ ners . &quot;
before Christian mission@@ ary ank@@ amen , betra@@ yed Me@@ e p@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans a God named U@@ GA Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not acc@@ ustom@@ ed to wear these clothes , &quot; says Deg@@ ei and indicates their lively , handmade tur@@ ban , her dar@@ ker and her light rock . &quot;
&quot; sooner we only had leaves to our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province where 28 % of humans live under the poverty line and some of the worst inf@@ ant mort@@ ality and ep@@ eti@@ tic rates in Asia have .
but it is also Indonesia Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and profitable Gold@@ mine from the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a stron@@ gh@@ old in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3.000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has built in value of 3,@@ 1 billion US dollars gold and copper . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Pap@@ ua has wooden natural resources in the value of estimated 78 billion US dollars . &quot;
&quot; however , this rich@@ es are a source of mis@@ ery for the Pap@@ ua , which ensure that Indonesia shar@@ ehol@@ ding military has ret@@ ained an un@@ stuff@@ ed presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port local military relatives and units between 1998 and 2004 almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 15@@ 0.000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ sian demands are threatened after greater autonomy and treat these golden G@@ ans and are ad@@ mitted .
&quot; according to the statements of acti@@ vi@@ sts , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua have been killed and thousands have been rolled out by the ind@@ on@@ esian military , tor@@ tured and ar@@ tis@@ ed . &quot;
mass@@ ages in Pap@@ u@@ as are subject to gen@@ oci@@ de in the 1970 @-@ 77 years in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Committee to commit gen@@ oci@@ de .
&quot; in the region alone , the Indonesian police last year more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; we value the Every@@ thing , it is in a report of the arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese Bris@@ bane in the year 2016 , in the reports of the atro@@ cities of the previous year , such as ir@@ regul@@ ators and torture - r@@ ape , and electro@@ des are particularly popular - and the bru@@ tal ra@@ inf@@ ect@@ ation of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as each week , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researchers for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
the screws have intensi@@ fied as Pap@@ u@@ as resources make a state of settl@@ ers from other parts of Indonesia .
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is too 83 % Christian , but the dem@@ ographic development changes , since Muslim economic immig@@ rants come from the pop@@ ulous islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ aw@@ esi . &quot;
Jav@@ anese War@@ ung @-@ Cant@@ inen selling b@@ aked chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with ground @-@ sauce . &quot;
local people are fighting for here .
&quot; the migrants have begun , chick@@ ens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua &quot; , &quot; explains A@@ beth You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ locals , who moved into the provin@@ cial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has the native Pap@@ ua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; from Pap@@ ua - their market costs . &quot;
&quot; the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wid@@ o@@ do , in the Volk@@ sm@@ und as Jok@@ ow@@ i , talked to the ine@@ qualities and the legal infring@@ ements in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
the former Zimmer@@ mann sight@@ ed 27 of the total 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
&quot; but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the locals feel che@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we spent 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the expect@@ ation that he will fulfil our hopes that fair@@ ness is restored , &quot; says You . &quot;
indeed Pan@@ i@@ ai actually thre@@ aten Pan@@ i@@ ai only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inaugur@@ ation in October a deep point .
on 7 December 2014 a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas lieder in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali as two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle by the darkness .
the cro@@ quet children said to them that they should switch their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers participated in their tone and came later with four soldiers , so the local past@@ or Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers , the soldiers had h@@ unted , h@@ unted , and sm@@ ote the group with their winn@@ ings , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then dam@@ ed one of the soldiers into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard be@@ aten that he fell into the Com@@ a . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby government Commission was set in brand and the things escal@@ ates the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gather together on a football field before the local police station and the Military Committee of Justice to demand justice . &quot;
they tru@@ gen sm@@ em@@ oni@@ zing tag@@ ged and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle up and a bird @-@ called im@@ iti@@ ating - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e p@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some prot@@ esters began stones on police and military po@@ sten to bo@@ unce .
&quot; as the atmosphere was heated , the soldiers was sent a command over an internal thread : &quot; if the masses have more than three times , they shoot it dead , &quot; says it in an official document of TI@@ ME , which has not been released by the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ emi@@ as Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto quarter of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the dro@@ ught danger and called to rest and called for the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was listening in the mood .
&quot; when I turned myself , I suddenly shot in my lin@@ kes wr@@ ist &quot; , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the veranda of his coloured painted wooden building . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame knows still not , who has fallen , but says that the ball came out of the ranks of the soldiers gathered here . &quot;
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were folded , &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his co@@ us@@ in , the witness of the sho@@ ots was . &quot;
&quot; I ran@@ ned to him and taught his body to be sure that he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ ane , who like many Indonesian only a name , the TI@@ ME in d@@ ü@@ ster@@ er mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I have kis@@ sed him .
&quot; the editor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said Re@@ por@@ ters that his officers &quot; wanted to secure their station only &quot; because they are attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves if people dro@@ ught to kill us , &quot; said the spok@@ es@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pud@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch five young prot@@ esters have been killed and many others have been in@@ ju@@ red .
the messages about the kill@@ ings came only on the following day &apos; filter@@ ed &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks held Jok@@ ow@@ i in Jay@@ ap@@ ura gave a passionate speech , in which he re@@ formed sympath@@ ies for the families of victims and sw@@ ept the historical mis@@ ses in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case be resolved right now , so that there will no longer be happening in the future . &quot;
&quot; security minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 , that he had a court @-@ out mechanism to insert historical human rights ab@@ uses . &quot;
but the talk began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; most inj@@ uries have occurred a long time ago . &quot;
some were in the 90 @-@ s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ he years .
&quot; the point is that we have committed to pass these violations , but there are processes running through , he said . &quot;
&quot; then I made an withdrawal , when he spoke on 5 June in Jak@@ arta with TI@@ ME , and said , he have no plans , in Pap@@ ua a complaint mechanism . &quot;
&quot; instead , &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; tribul@@ ations , who demanded the UN for crimes against humanity , &quot; said that 11 cases of violations of human rights violations in Pap@@ ua had already been attached , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai inci@@ dent . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims took such claims with gri@@ mm@@ ed un@@ believers .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress &quot; , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ ane . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear for years .
&quot; I have fear , &quot; says he . &quot;
&quot; I have fear , arrested by military fear , have been afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ aco@@ bus repeti@@ tive the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai fears have to discuss the inci@@ dent .
&quot; he says that he was be@@ aten by the military after he saved four of the victims . &quot;
&quot; after I buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , sought the military after me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confront@@ ation between village room@@ mates and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , who consec@@ rated to hospital a un@@ conscious man in hospital , died a person and 17 others were wo@@ und@@ ed , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was er@@ un@@ ken , when he died in a nearby river , died on the way to hospital . &quot;
the vill@@ agers pro@@ mpt@@ ed in front of the site office of the company .
&quot; the police said that the vill@@ agers bri@@ cks were on officers , that they re@@ acted by giving warning . &quot;
but locals say that the mobile Brig@@ ade ( Indonesian par@@ am@@ ilit@@ ary police ) began to shoot and put a dead@@ ly .
&quot; we were so in panic , we have fear that it will be re@@ ven@@ ge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i , who has been delivered in the vicinity of the hospital house and witness , as the last here was quick to be delivered quickly , so the TI@@ ME . &quot;
&quot; I have hidden me two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called the participating officers and pull the mobile Brig@@ ade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an Un@@ ru@@ h@@ ehr@@ d for the Indonesian government .
&quot; the lack of meaning@@ ful development strength@@ ens the dis@@ satisfaction of the tribe of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al that live in the green highlands of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many f@@ ills the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , who claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by taking spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and deport@@ ation of ind@@ on@@ esian soldiers . &quot;
some of the top @-@ O@@ PM guide come from Pan@@ i@@ ai by including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ ya Kog@@ o@@ ya .
&quot; in response to the last few years thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai , and taken united in prison , under the pre@@ text of &quot; safeguarding national sovereignty . &quot;
some will never dive again .
&quot; among the people in Pap@@ ua is Pan@@ i@@ ai as &quot; a trag@@ ic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strength@@ ens the dis@@ satisfaction .
&quot; the bit of Rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is for locals too expensive . &quot;
bread is just as no range .
the people here build everything to what they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf no@@ zzle .
&quot; agriculture is the task of women , which can process four or five fields of the cand@@ le labels . &quot;
&quot; they keep the bulk of harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market . &quot;
ten pieces of not@@ a tast@@ ed only 10,000 Indonesian R@@ up@@ ies ( 75 c@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; in the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities between the local Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown since the opening of new passengers to the airport of Nab@@ ire in larger numbers . &quot;
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and aff@@ lu@@ ent migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to lead their own company competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in to stay in the village ... because there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John G@@ ob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribe of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
insulation keeps the eyes of the world far away from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions of reporting international media are ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year the French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Bas@@ ille Long@@ ch@@ amp because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although they gave to rare permission to movies . &quot;
&quot; according to Ph@@ el@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch , the promise of Jok@@ ow@@ is constitu@@ ent to raise the limitations of reporting to improve transparency and development . &quot;
&quot; there are new haz@@ ards for foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesian un@@ quiet provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua . &quot; &quot; Visa @-@ Ver@@ wei@@ an and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; lack of freedom control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in March , six Pacific @-@ fish countries - Tong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marsh@@ all@@ in@@ seln and the whole @-@ islands - the UN Human Rights sr@@ ate to investigate the &quot; various and widely widespread inj@@ uries &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai sho@@ oter . &quot;
the same countries historically viewed the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spok@@ es@@ man of the ind@@ on@@ esian Ministry of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a Nas@@ ir dism@@ is@@ sed the adv@@ ent of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia still holds a democratic system , and there is free media so it is difficult to keep the evidence for human rights waste . &quot;
people on the spot want to take note of more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the Human Rights of Bot@@ ees K@@ ees Van B@@ aar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , visited &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also attended the session but anonymous , but anonymous . &quot;
Indonesia has another presidential election but the Pap@@ ua say that it probably will not be right for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is involved from the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai attacks , &quot; says G@@ ob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribe . &quot;
&quot; he wants to know that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it is living under the constant threat of a moral military . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua have to consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; gu@@ ilt &quot; that he has to pay . &quot;
&quot; you do not need money , they just want justice . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and in@@ tim@@ id@@ ations led the families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sch@@ uss@@ ed @-@ offering a last symbo@@ lic act of Trotsky : the body &apos;s body was buried in a terrain exactly opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that they may never give justice , but at least they do not let those responsible for their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ aco@@ bus with health@@ ier head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scrap@@ ers of Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire was found on Friday at one of the highest resi@@ dences of the world in Dubai , and forc@@ ing hundreds of inhabitants from the 337 meters high , 79 @-@ stor@@ ey building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second Brand , which arose in just two years through the plat@@ eau , which is called due to the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , inj@@ uries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we are at the fire alarm , and for the cry of people . &quot;
&quot; we ran down the stairs , and it lasted about 10 minutes to come from the 50@@ th floor to come down , &quot; told a resident who told his name as George , Reu@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; Dub@@ ais civilians , said that the units of fire fighting against 4.00 pm is GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building . &quot;
&quot; the government said , they work on the provision of accommodation for those affected . &quot;
&quot; the inci@@ dent can be used questions about the safety of materials , which are used in external areas of sky@@ scrap@@ ers throughout the world . &quot;
&quot; an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 , that the largest portion of damages caused by cl@@ adding , the outer gar@@ ment for decor@@ ating or isolation . &quot;
&quot; in the United Kingdom said the police , they believe that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding to the London Gren@@ ada tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a brand in which approximately 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup @-@ Reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis club ( IT@@ F ) has fallen in the General Davis Cup cup with its large Davis Cup @-@ Cou@@ p in the Annual General Assembly .
&quot; during the meeting in H@@ o Chi Min@@ h city was supported for this sport revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup @-@ single only to two winners , Hau@@ ch@@ eckl@@ ist not supported by the necessary two @-@ third majority . &quot;
&quot; although often very long , but even so very estimated five @-@ set @-@ classics will be preserved to the tradition of tradition . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3,@@ 54 percent of member states voted for reform , the aim of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only barely missed . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our membership is not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these ik@@ onic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; Hag@@ ger@@ ty said . &quot;
you will continue to work to improve the applic@@ ant .
&quot; at all , not only for the voting was already before the suggestion , the finale came to a neutral place . &quot;
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively minor details : so the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in future will have the host right in the first round .
&quot; to reduce the costs for the organiz@@ er , the requirements in training should be facilit@@ ated , etc . and the players will need to complete the Davis Cup less official media dates . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 out of 5 US travelers cont@@ amin@@ ated items into the aircraft , will find a survey . &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted by air pass@@ ages that more than 20 percent are aware of or un@@ conscious items to the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent by air@@ plane , while they dec@@ ei@@ ved kni@@ ves or other items with blade . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 per cent said , they would have been del@@ ayed that they have travelled mist@@ ak@@ ely with Sch@@ uss@@ ine , am@@ muni@@ tion or jumping . &quot;
&quot; the survey with more than 1,000 persons - which was carried out by a Jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , performed - also fixed that younger travellers sooner rather le@@ ep the rules . &quot;
&quot; by the respon@@ dents , the enc@@ ore that they were particularly trying to fly with something that was forbidden by T@@ SA , were 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , the members of the X X were . &quot;
&quot; the most common objects , which were inten@@ tional to T@@ SA agents , were food and liqui@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; more than 3 per cent gave to each other items with blade by using the security role , while 2.2 percent of female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of the male survey also confirmed that they were inten@@ sely ased drugs into the plane . &quot;
&quot; the company said , there were travelers throughout the country to find out how many acci@@ dent@@ ally brought away by the airport security and how many of it was inten@@ sely done . &quot;
&quot; there is no surprise that people who take on the most est sm@@ ug@@ ware - wis@@ ely or uncert@@ ain - by security , those were most often fly . &quot;
&quot; however , the company points out that the T@@ SA Guid@@ elines somewhat complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people are often uncert@@ ain which liqui@@ ds may take them or how much of it .
&quot; so , there is no surprise that the largest amount used by the T@@ SA compl@@ ex@@ ed items covered . &quot;
&quot; for a time , the people thought , the T@@ SA could watch books as sm@@ ug@@ gling . &quot;
liqui@@ ds are allowed on domestic flights but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is no matter : tens of thousands Tes@@ la @-@ clients can@@ cel@@ ing orders
El@@ on Mus@@ k is happy with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
he has so far revealed that part of the customers has already with@@ drawn their non @-@ binding reservation already .
&quot; in addition to the always tri@@ um@@ ph@@ ant figures on sales up figures and even gig@@ anti @-@ Chef El@@ on mus@@ k has betra@@ yed for the first time a different , less g@@ lanz@@ full number : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ k was often used in the past few months with the more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery was just beginning . &quot;
&quot; now , Mus@@ k is a : from the total 5@@ 18.@@ 000 pre @-@ orders are 6@@ 3,@@ 000 already with@@ drawn . &quot;
cri@@ tics always had pointed out that it is only a non @-@ binding reservation .
&quot; if cancellation is paying Tes@@ la , the 1000 euro ( in the US 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; Reser@@ vation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; currently , 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations made before , spatial Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analy@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; however , the cancellation of so far approximately twelve percent of all orders could be made to the problem , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe . &quot;
&quot; his argument : the challenge for ambitious growth aim is not in demand , but on the production site . &quot;
&quot; in the past year Tes@@ la 8@@ 4,@@ 000 vehicles provided . &quot;
&quot; by 2018 , it should be put together - all models - 500@@ .000 , 2020 per million . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , early times a day 1800 reservations are available . &quot;
&quot; who today ordered a &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; must calculate the ear@@ liest of 2018 in the second half of 2018 with delivery - if Tes@@ la es it creates its brand new , nor even in practice @-@ driven production roads without any major inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum relief . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; however , it is too much del@@ ays , then the in@@ dul@@ gence of the reservations may become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; for then , the company can not stop its satisfied customers in Sch@@ aren . &quot;
EP@@ A @-@ Chief Pru@@ itt moving out of indications of the rules of Obama &apos;s Er@@ a to reduce emissions
&quot; one day after having been indic@@ ted by 15 countries , Scott Pru@@ itt , the leader of the environmental authority , its former decision back to delay the implementation of the rules of Obama &apos;s era to reduce emissions Smo@@ g @-@ cleaning valves . &quot;
&quot; Pru@@ itt presented the shift , as its agency proved to be the needs of state authorities to be respon@@ sive than previous vulner@@ abilities . &quot;
he did not mention the law@@ suit against his previous place in a Federal Constitu@@ tional Court .
&quot; it is about a deadline , which ran on the 1st of October for states to keep the standards of 2015 for bott@@ led oceans . &quot;
&quot; Pru@@ itt said in June , that he will delay the observ@@ ance for a year to study his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid taking in local decisions , or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot;
&quot; Pru@@ itt , who was in front of his appointment by President Donald Tru@@ mp prosec@@ ut@@ or of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a long time a reliable opponent in strict environmental protection regulations . &quot;
&quot; since his arrival in Washington , Pru@@ itt repeatedly spoke to block the Reg@@ ul@@ atory or to delay the chemical industry and industry of fos@@ sil fu@@ els . &quot;
the su@@ dden conversion from Wednesday is the most recent legal backl@@ ash for the completion of regular Roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month has decided by the Federal Constitu@@ tional Court in Washington that the EP@@ A @-@ stew@@ ard has passed its authority as he tried , the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas company for monitoring and reduction of meth@@ an@@ lec@@ s comp@@ ates , to delay . &quot;
&quot; in an on Wednesday evening , I proposed the statement on the willingness of the EP@@ A to co @-@ operation with the States through the complex process of timely performance of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; among former vulner@@ abilities the EP@@ A often has maintained the dead@@ lines for carrying out , and then waiting to set out of acti@@ vi@@ sts and others , and in an agreement to set the appointment for performing established , &quot; &quot; I said the EP@@ A more than a do@@ zen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation by proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot;
we also take the law and authority which there is serious .
&quot; nevertheless , the statement of the EP@@ A , that I was able to take advantage of his &quot; authority for the delay and all other legal services available to ensure that the rules on a solid policy and the best available information is based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Congress is pus@@ hing for a wider real@@ ms of the oceans .
&quot; one of the last month approved legislation , the implementation of the rules of 2015 should delay at least eight years . &quot;
the measure was not yet placed in the Senate of the Senate .
&quot; the New York Secretary General , Eric C@@ der@@ man who conducted the coalition of the states that the EP@@ A entered this week , said the Group intend to maintain the legal pressure . &quot;
&quot; the conversion from the EP@@ A - after our Kl@@ agen - is an important gain for health and safety of these 6.9 million New York and which are over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by smo@@ g , who sei@@ zed in their communities . &quot;
&quot; new York sh@@ ines in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Mass@@ ach@@ us@@ etts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ hi@@ van@@ ien , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot;
&quot; ground @-@ Oz@@ on is created when poll@@ ut@@ ants made of cars , power stations , oil refin@@ eries , chem@@ ie@@ ties and other sources in the atmosphere on sun@@ light . &quot;
&quot; the de@@ generation smo@@ g can cause serious breathing difficulties in sensitive groups of people serious breathing difficulties , and every year to thousands of premature death . &quot;
representatives of the public health system and the environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered over a number of surprising positions .
&quot; it is disturb@@ ing how much pressure is needed to breathe this rational step by those responsible for the protection of air , which we inhal@@ e to breathe , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Diversity . &quot;
&quot; we must continue to fight against ide@@ ological Crus@@ ade of the Tru@@ mp Government , to oppos@@ e environmental pollution and their particular interests . &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celeb@@ rates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : during the anniversary of the mountain church will be invited to the old cemetery @-@ area in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , 16 . July , at 16.@@ 30 p.m. to a Ser@@ en@@ ade . &quot;

the visitors of the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be ench@@ anted by this powerful place .
rescue and conservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and conveyor tum@@ ours to their concern .
Walter Mart@@ ini emphas@@ ises : &quot; it is a unique d@@ ör@@ f@@ ous small@@ od . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was mentioned for the first time in Wür@@ ttem@@ berg@@ ische Ur@@ customer book : Graf Hermann von Sul@@ z sold , including the Vog@@ bey &quot; to Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard by Hor@@ b and his brother Diet@@ rich for 20 Mark Silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the wor@@ ding of the de@@ y , after the tum@@ linger mountain apart from the priest , the church or the pat@@ ron@@ ats@@ k was also belong@@ ed to the church or the Pat@@ ron@@ ats@@ right , and not the other way round . &quot;
so there were people there .
&quot; as from the description of the Upper Freu@@ den@@ stadt von 18@@ 58 , was next to the Sub@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which today are still seen in the village of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the glori@@ fied sett@@ ler of the village . &quot;
old maps from the period around the year 1600 under@@ lined these historical conditions .
the Pat@@ ron@@ ats@@ right was born from the early medieval y@@ early law .
&quot; a master who built a church , equipment and with a priest , continued to participate in this church and could also explo@@ it these peculi@@ arities . &quot;
&quot; thus , the right to use a par@@ ser or propose a new priest to the bis@@ hop of a new priest . &quot;
three alt@@ ars were there in the church and two bells on the tower .
the larger of the two zer@@ bar@@ st on Christmas 1673 .
&quot; the newly created bell set for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be cancelled later during the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
in the 30 @-@ year war ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the window panels were pushed and the glo@@ ck@@ ers were st@@ olen .
the roof was un@@ dense .
1796 &apos;s French troops in the vicinity of the church .
they bra@@ king the pul@@ pit and pal@@ ms and used them as a fire@@ wood .
remains of the church dro@@ ught 18@@ 09 .
up to 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery also served as the last retirement for the dead from listening .
18@@ 23 the cemetery extends and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was abandoned .
just the Cher@@ ry tower you left .
in the New Year 18@@ 34 sp@@ elled a storm the cherry and half over@@ thre@@ w .
to prevent a mistake , the tower was abandoned . &quot;
only the present tower of Tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g stayed as a witness of the 750 years old church history .
&quot; today , Horst K@@ .com.ve and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em by the &quot; &quot; Schaff@@ ner Rent@@ ner &quot; &quot; as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn the Hil@@ arius system . &quot;

society wants to examine the auth@@ orization of wind @-@ bicycles
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim hon@@ ored &quot; &quot; does not look at the legal condition for the construction and therefore has turned towards the Land@@ rat . &quot;
&quot; the association &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim is hon@@ ored &quot; &quot; has called Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw its approval for the establishment of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . &quot;
it is illegal .
&quot; the association ar@@ gues that at the time the approval was approved on 30 December 2016 at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette no wind turbines , as at the time in Vier@@ sen only exists at the city border to Schwal@@ m@@ tal . &quot;
&quot; within this concent@@ ric zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are fundament@@ ally possible , at the same time the concent@@ rates zone is also a exclusion of wind @-@ energy use for the other districts . &quot;
Der@@ lei zones should prevent a &quot; &quot; rec@@ ess &quot; of the landscape . &quot;
&quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had not decided few days before due to a change of the hed@@ ron plan , a second wind turbines of the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - which however had not approved the District government Düsseldorf not approved because of a formal error . &quot;
&quot; by the lack of the legal requirement , the authorised per@@ missions is said to be illegal and therefore also died , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; . &quot; &quot;
current status of things : the city entered again the wind @-@ concent@@ ric zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; a permit of the District government is still out .
&quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; thus , this is the assessment of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines and legally excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the so@@ lic@@ itation .
&quot; the corresponding letter has gone up since last week at the district of Vier@@ sen , &quot; explained a speaker . &quot;
the circle takes her to the occasion to consider the matter once again .
they are not likely to carry out that the procedure is stopped .
&quot; with a view to the ongoing procedures with the administrative Court , the circle was not cont@@ acted on Thursday in the case of the argum@@ entation of the &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette the construction of four each 200 metres high wind bikes . &quot;
&quot; last year , the company had participated in which the town quarters is also involved with the owner of about 65 hectares of large terrain . &quot;
&quot; with the establishment of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households can be covered - this corresponds to approximately a five @-@ bed of all four @-@ sen@@ ders households . &quot;
the NEW Re want to invest around 20 million euros .
&quot; last summer , Vier@@ sens Town entered green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind park of Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen , as well as a participation in a Wind@@ energy plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg . &quot;
car and tractor kra@@ b together : woman dies in an aw@@ ful accident
one hor@@ ri@@ ble traffic accident at 10 am on the L 333 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and B@@ loss@@ oms ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ circle ) is suitable .
a woman was wo@@ und@@ ed in a dead@@ ly .
two more people have been slightly viol@@ ated .
the provin@@ cial service remained locked over hours .
&quot; after police , a 17 @-@ year young woman made out of Bor@@ ni@@ ch with her car as part of the accompanying ride with her 53 @-@ year mother as a accompanying person the L 333 in the direction of B@@ sinc@@ ere . &quot;
city and tra@@ ders are planning &quot; home @-@ Sh@@ oppen &quot; -@@ weekend
Bad Langen@@ sal@@ za@@ ers and people from the region to re@@ discover the shopping possibilities in the downtown area in September .
the commercial association and city administration want to take advantage of the weekend on 8th and 9th September to lo@@ l the inhabitants of the shopping district into the city center .
&quot; like the Chairman of the Ge@@ werbe@@ verein , Christian King , anch@@ ored , the &quot; home @-@ Sh@@ oppen &quot; -@@ weekend , the &quot; home @-@ Sh@@ oppen &quot; &quot; is intended to raise the customers the own city away from the usual supermarket @-@ commodity . &quot;
&quot; planned is accordingly a market with regional suppliers , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , local companies should present themselves with their educational movements . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city center is to invite you to the &quot; Mid@@ night @-@ Sh@@ oppen &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the action is not only for inhabitants of the city and the surrounding area .
&quot; in preparation , adverti@@ sers in the radio , an internet @-@ video and printed bag that refer to the Ak@@ tions weekend , so Christian King . &quot;
Municip@@ al Auth@@ orities and Ge@@ werbe@@ verein cooperate with the Industrial and Chamber of Commerce .
&quot; thus , the Ge@@ werbe@@ verein and the city go into another stage of the project &quot; At@@ tr@@ active downtown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these include new offers as the first &quot; &quot; active day &quot; &quot; for Brun@@ nen@@ firmly including sold @-@ out Sunday , discussions with all commercial men and hosts to move them to the active participation . &quot;
&quot; additionally , attractive offers to Saturday and finishing in parking fees on that day are part of the concept . &quot;
&quot; in addition , customer pot@@ entials should be re@@ conc@@ iled or closed again . &quot;
these include spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the inner city by shopping out of the view .
&quot; in the end all , everyone would need to re@@ vit@@ alize the city center - up to land@@ lords , the businesses of the whole city and one . &quot;
&quot; it will be able to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy network , which had been partly spread , King had said in spring . &quot;
&quot; Bir@@ git St@@ rich , Head of I@@ HK @-@ Centers in Mühl@@ hausen shared with that in the nation@@ wide third &quot; &quot; home Sh@@ oppen &quot; &quot; day , for the first time five Thuring@@ ian cities are participating . &quot;
&quot; besides Bad Langen@@ sal@@ za , this Wei@@ mar , S@@ ö@@ m@@ mer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de . &quot;
&quot; the day sol@@ le to promote the este@@ em of local trade and its importance for the common good of our cities put stronger , so steep . &quot;
the promotion of the I@@ HK and with many partners make it clear that every citizen can affect its business behaviour .

Tru@@ mp sat down after a be@@ amed tran@@ scription of phone call Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scription between U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on January 27@@ th , Tru@@ mp called on a call with the Mexican pres@@ idents En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Ni@@ eto , to be heard , publicly said that he would not pay for a planned border wall . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. president sei@@ zed him , because he had publicly disclosed the wall , and he said to him , &quot; &quot; this cannot say the press . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp started his presidential campaign with the promise , on the southern border of the USA a wall to establish and sul@@ try , Mexico for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scription of his first sight with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull have also been published and un@@ v@@ eil@@ ed a ten@@ se exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp said Mr. Turn@@ bull said that a trade for the USA refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia , &quot; &quot; ri@@ dic@@ ulous &quot; , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; stup@@ id &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; du@@ ly , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; du@@ p &quot; &quot; had to look like a &quot; &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; &quot; after it was proposed to ban the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the USA . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp be@@ ended the call , after he had said Mr Turn@@ bull , &quot; that &apos;s the uncomfortable occasion for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ores Ford @-@ Mass@@ re : acti@@ vi@@ sts do rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as call for justice once again
&quot; a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cur@@ y drove by a group of spect@@ ators in rural Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and ru@@ mp@@ ed to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had to reach the bridge , entered a group of white men with awareness of blo@@ cking his way . &quot;
the leader of the Mob@@ s - a man middle age in a needle @-@ dress - took a long train to its c@@ ig@@ ar and op@@ aque due to the wind@@ shield .
&quot; inside , the in@@ mates in fear . &quot;
&quot; we want this n ---- r Roger ! &quot; br@@ aces of the man .
&quot; get him from the car ! &quot;
&quot; cr@@ ush the silence , when a young black man was dist@@ ort@@ ed by the passenger &apos;s seat . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , this terrible scene which was played on 22 July , just a reminder . &quot;
&quot; but if then a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; Roger , sti@@ e@@ zes almost all in the audience very real S@@ eu@@ f@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 Citi@@ zens of the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge back to im@@ itate the night , in the two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , as well as George and Ma@@ e Murray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u K@@ lux Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
no one has been charged because of the mur@@ ders .
&quot; it is really un@@ constitutional that in all these years ago was not the only person arrested - although we know them in our communities , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks who helps with the organisation of delivery . &quot;
&quot; it is a strainer on a story , but it is a burden to our souls . &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former congress member of the State Georgia and a Life of Citi@@ zenship .
&quot; for him , the im@@ position for him serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual memory of the Mon@@ roe community , that an un@@ fairly has never been correc@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; we want to be prosec@@ ution , we want to end , we want healing , we want to reconciliation , but first we must preserve justice . &quot;
&quot; we cannot go to healing and reconciliation , until we get justice . &quot;
a juris@@ dictions laid a beg@@ ining of the body of one of the victims of Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ n on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to F@@ BI files that have been received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding county in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot;
but no one has ever been charged .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects have been on free foot for decades to say Citi@@ zenship , that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , made a decision of the Supre@@ me Court of Justice of the Black citizens in Georgia for the first time to give a vote in summer their voice . &quot;
&quot; about at the same time as choosing the case following the F@@ BI of the black far@@ mp@@ ass Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owners , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a struggle - suppos@@ edly because of a woman . &quot;
&quot; Bro@@ oks said , the sc@@ aff@@ les in the city has been that H@@ ester with Mal@@ com &apos;s wife Dor@@ othy slept and that the baby that carried her , not by her husband . &quot;
&quot; on 25 July 1946 paid Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owners , 600 dollars to liber@@ ate Mal@@ com from prison , so the F@@ BI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her C@@ ous@@ ine Ma@@ e Murray and George Dor@@ sey to the prison .
&quot; but when they went away from prison and get the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , um@@ ring@@ ed a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison that has prepared and ordered the Mor@@ de , includes here a F@@ BI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a full agreement between the state and local prosec@@ ution , which was not only involved in the mor@@ den , evidence , and the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Bro@@ oks formulated it even more important .
&quot; it was a voting right @-@ mass@@ ac@@ re , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; if you register and if you agree , then you will happen here . &quot;
almost a decade of Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual closing of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
&quot; their representation is decent , erg@@ ying , and is based in a kind of profound rac@@ ism , many believe that he no longer exists in America . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to look at , and even more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that the point is . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ n , because we will be confront@@ ed with its h@@ ug@@ liness into all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you if you do not want to listen , or don &apos;t want to hear what I have done . &quot;
&quot; the samples for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day were almost 30 actors - a do@@ zen consec@@ ration and the rest of Schwar@@ ze - into a space and nois@@ y , as Gre@@ ene started a well taken review of the piece started . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ director .
&quot; he has played the role of Chief C@@ lan@@ members for years , but he said , the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I am not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it is very important to get this story in life , because we would not want to return to these times . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the room , the actors D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ cona , the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester play , their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester , and cher@@ ries him , angry that he has slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he , van@@ ish of my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ en@@ shi@@ pl@@ ers the fire .
there is a break .
and then each ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene lau@@ gh at the lou@@ est .
&quot; what ? ! &quot; , &quot; asked Ras@@ field . &quot;
he is al@@ arm@@ oured and conf@@ used .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still k@@ ich@@ ern@@ d . &quot;
I simply don &apos;t think that white people back then &apos; n --- he &apos; told .
&quot; but , &quot; wit@@ ch one of the other black performers . &quot;
&quot; you only need to make the hard &apos; R. &apos; . &quot;
&quot; and that is exactly there the energy in the room , a feeling of camera re@@ places re@@ places the dis@@ comfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy to get this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene begins once again .
&quot; this time , when Ras@@ cona the N word says , he says it sharp and with re @-@ pressure . &quot;
absolutely no one laugh@@ s .
this repeti@@ tion end violent and fast .
&quot; there are scre@@ ens , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman , dres@@ sed with a dream dress , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actor and performs Bil@@ lie Holidays mour@@ ern@@ de Lob@@ talk &quot; St@@ range Fru@@ it &quot; . &quot; &quot;
your voice breaks down in every second word .
&quot; about one hundred meters behind it , a group of about four do@@ zen vie@@ wers and t@@ ears from the eyes . &quot;
the audience is divided into almost uniform@@ ly between black and white .
&quot; a pair is made of I@@ th@@ aca , New York , recommended to see the performance , many come only down the road . &quot;
they have all experienced almost eight hours of Georgia when Bro@@ oks she goes on a pilgri@@ mage to the tom@@ atoes of the Mal@@ com and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; until this point are the Mor@@ de an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now when you found on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels ges@@ pen@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; if the last sheet of the song end , Gre@@ ene invites you to come closer to insp@@ ect the amount and the body &apos;s name . &quot;
children ho@@ cken on their minds to register the f@@ ake blood and the breast@@ feeding body and fle@@ eting each other .
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ derer a little boy , as a set he will remember it . &quot;
after a few minutes thanks Gre@@ ene the crowd and suddenly it is over .
the actors take the Lyn@@ chs@@ eil weg and w@@ anting their t@@ ears .
&quot; Brad@@ sh@@ aw um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the sight , who played the C@@ lan@@ t member . &quot;
Nick Ras@@ en@@ av@@ ed two of his fellow players and breaks down in her arms cr@@ ying along with the emotional load of the insur@@ rection finally breaks down with him .
&quot; it is okay , &quot; fle@@ eting one of women . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done this out of one reason . &quot;
later the audience with the actors for dinner together .
at a table pl@@ au@@ en a white pair from Atlan@@ ta stim@@ ulated about the off@@ spring with a black pair that they just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski fought the words to find words that feeling the performance .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and de@@ eds ... of people coming , which like you look and what they do , because they look like you , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what really does me do with me , lets me believe that the Lyn@@ n still goes on , she added , &quot; today the only police officers . &quot;
&quot; in the same room Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks court holds at his table , he is@@ st and remember the civil rights . &quot;
he said he already started to plan the performance next year .
&quot; the task is inspir@@ ational , because it describes the fri@@ ght of what we bear , but it is also a moment of learning . &quot;
&quot; it is so when we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; who does not studied his own history , who knows his own history , he is condem@@ ned to repeat them . &quot;

&quot; in 2013 he had to leave a g@@ ell@@ ent concert over himself , there were five years later big ju@@ bel , in which the single &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; went down . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have rejo@@ ic@@ ed .
&quot; you remember that the audience grew up with the &quot; Ring &quot; in some way , she had said just before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of its view . &quot;
I am a positive Res@@ um@@ é .
max quantity is working as a volunte@@ er
they work in their volunte@@ er year at several locations .
where everywhere ?
&quot; quantity : usually in Stein@@ furt , in the Mö@@ ven@@ er@@ ör@@ se , once a week I help here in Gre@@ ven in the moving bridge . &quot;
and I have already worked at school at the open day at school .
what are your experiences with it ?
&quot; quantity : it is a nice , wide range , which I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with juven@@ iles , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ professional volunte@@ er . &quot;
how does this happen ?
quantity : I made Ab@@ it@@ ur .
&quot; and then a building studies , let us say successful . &quot;
I recognized for me that it is wrong for me and I want to make something different with people .
and then I asked me what do you do .
&quot; a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the burner may well , really is . &quot;
and was it so ?
quantity : I have great impressions collected .
I will start my studies in the winter semester of my studies in the soci@@ ology .
I will study dual controller , probably in the Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social worker and studi@@ ere in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hoch@@ schule . &quot;
is it not un@@ common during the volunte@@ er service to have several different locations ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it is probably always being on where you are his F@@ SJ .
it can make it from Alter@@ sheim to youth work - in all sorts of fac@@ ets of social work .
with me it was very varied .

for me this was exactly the right that has led me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs .
different than in the building of civil society ?
&quot; quantity : na clear , here it is not about to be reck@@ on . &quot;
&quot; one has always another human mind , which each has a very different story behind themselves . &quot;
&quot; whether a re@@ fuge@@ e , whether a youth who have been taken out of the family - you have to always go individual to it . &quot;
very interesting .
and you did not have a touch ?
quantity : for this I am not the type .
there is a area that gives a lot .
lots of love , lots of kindness . &quot;
&quot; there are also negative moments , but so life is just negative moments . &quot;
Pear@@ son abbrevi@@ ates more 3,@@ 000 jobs and short@@ ened the divi@@ dend for the business rest@@ ing back &quot;
&quot; the British educational group Pear@@ son said on Friday , they will build more 3,@@ 000 jobs and run their intermediate divi@@ dend by 72 percent since another restructuring program will be launched to overcome the pressure using the company . &quot;
&quot; fil@@ ing , the Secretary @-@ Director John Fall@@ on pre@@ domin@@ antly for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , in which already 4.000 jobs were lost . &quot;
&quot; Pear@@ son announced in May in a third cost @-@ program , a plan for cost reduction to further 300 million pounds ( 394 million US dollars ) to re@@ ward a business again , which was hit by the fast step towards digital learning . &quot;
&quot; the company dedicated his participation in Pen@@ gu@@ in Rand@@ om House at the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the fiscal year was unchanged since it was achieved a pre @-@ volume of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds . &quot;
con@@ vo@@ i @-@ attack by Kab@@ ul : NATO @-@ sol@@ dier in self @-@ attack
&quot; a self @-@ folder has attacked a military con@@ voy at the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killed a soldiers of Nat@@ o and several others , say officials . &quot;
&quot; five soldiers and a interpre@@ ter had been in@@ ju@@ red , divided an explanation of Nat@@ o . &quot;
&quot; expected local reports , according to the inci@@ dent in the Q@@ Arab@@ ag@@ h district also three civilians . &quot;
the bom@@ bing is the last violence that Afghanistan made this month - on Tuesday were killed more than 30 people in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday there were a self @-@ ch@@ ord@@ ed two people near the Ira@@ qi emb@@ assy in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; in an opinion of Nat@@ o it means that the explo@@ sion took place on Thursday morning , when a joint Pat@@ rol was attacked with the Afgh@@ an army of a &quot; &quot; of persons in@@ concei@@ ved spring@@ set &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the statement defe@@ ated that all verses in a stable state are in a stable state and can be treated in the U.S. military hospital by the airport Bag@@ ram .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group that is known as a serious Islam@@ ist state ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram .
&quot; according to the United Nations , in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , there were at least 1.6@@ 62 of the death@@ s , of which about 20 % in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , a su@@ icide @-@ high@@ om@@ be at least 30 people in a mainly rail distributor of Kab@@ ul . &quot;
the Taliban said they would have taken this attack .
&quot; on May 31 , a huge bom@@ bar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant forces of the country , since the US @-@ guided troops 2001 the Taliban is dec@@ lined by power . &quot;
&quot; the violence emphas@@ ises the prec@@ ari@@ ous security situation in Afghanistan , since U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp , the number of US troops to support the military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the self @-@ folder will also have a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policy and especially in the call of President As@@ hr@@ af G@@ han@@ i . &quot;
EP@@ A returns to delay the smo@@ g rule on brack@@ ets
&quot; the US @-@ American environmental authority has a decision to delay a regulation of the government of Obama , susp@@ ended the states that Smo@@ ked smo@@ g @-@ caused emissions . this was a day after 15 countries spread the agency because of the stri@@ de . &quot;
&quot; the EP@@ A announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the &quot; &quot; Oz@@ on@@ ations 2015 &quot; &quot; and said , they show the obligation of the agency to work with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we react to our state partners , &quot; &quot; EP@@ A @-@ Chef Scott Pru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; Pru@@ gg@@ ers announced in June the intention of the EP@@ A announced , the Oz@@ on@@ ations - in which in a part of the country &apos;s poll@@ ut@@ ants to be measured to determine where inc@@ isions are to be ad@@ mitted to delay stric@@ ter bub@@ ble standards - to delay a year until October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , her@@ es on Tuesday K@@ lev@@ y , and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the Government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has attemp@@ ted to impos@@ e a wide range of environmental factors that the former President Barack Obama has risen , as part of a wider agenda , which is supposed to return the economic growth according to Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; however , the efforts have trig@@ gered the backl@@ ash of Democrats and nature groups which are worried about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the website of the EP@@ A says that inhal@@ ing the inhal@@ ation of air , the oceans contains &quot; the lung function and can rein@@ force the breathing symptoms , such as as@@ thma . &quot;
Trink@@ halle
&quot; in the end , the decision was clearly stated : in two contra@@ sts of the municipal win@@ egro@@ wer and the establishment of a communal area in the future senior residence . &quot;
&quot; in front of the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing principle , the Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; though I will still take it until the until so far the Church &apos;s parish belong@@ ed to the church , but there is now no plans for a private investor to st@@ em@@ ate project more . &quot;
there is a discussion regarding a common space .
&quot; one of the two investors who are still in the boat , has offered the church to meet . &quot;
on the ground floor it would provide a living space - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters of surface for a special price .
&quot; the administration and majority of the municipal council lies before , such a common room is not just as meeting place for the residents of the retirement right place , but open to the community . &quot;
as an example made the word of &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the decision will be decided by providing funds for the current budget already in the last autumn , through funding possibilities . &quot;
the construction is in the renovation area .
&quot; the establishment of a communal area would be , then reported T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the decision is seen to sign@@ alis@@ e the investor that one wants to throw him in this respect , does not want to throw him in this respect , that both Sadd@@ am - - what is reduced to the ambi@@ ent height and the construction of economic power - were possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less , so supp@@ ose not only Wil@@ fried So@@ h@@ mer , be this addi@@ tive . &quot;
if &apos; s helps : un@@ anim@@ ously he happens the body .
not so easy it comes to the common room .
&quot; Daniela Call refers to the many own buildings , with which one can not come so quite forward , for giving them to the common room from the window , she says : &quot; &quot; I do so hard with it . &quot;
Y@@ vonne Sta@@ iger is definitely committed to the common area - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it looks behind it an explo@@ ited sub @-@ influ@@ encing issues or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not so , because with the acquisition of the surface you do not give subsi@@ dy , but I come a real , in the branch of the counter@@ part , the counter@@ speech is contra@@ dic@@ tory . &quot;
&quot; state &apos;s application , resolutions required according to she@@ alth@@ y , will find three fears . &quot;
&quot; so it remains with two contra@@ sts at the original program , the Stefan H@@ aller can summar@@ izes : &quot; &quot; if we take the decision so , we make a giant steps to conclude a giant gap in our infrastructure . &quot;

hiking in the Har@@ z by Star to Star
&quot; in the resin , the nation@@ wide first &quot; star path &quot; is created . &quot;
this is planning to the Association observ@@ atory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
a plan@@ etary way there is in Gött@@ ingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; star pf@@ ad &quot; come to the information needs of many Har@@ z@@ visitors , it was called . &quot;
&quot; he connect nature , science , exercise and sporting performance . &quot;
the members want to stay along the planned route tables and find out more about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association is planning &quot; well @-@ reaching installations to five to six places &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; ques@@ tion@@ ate St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Bra@@ un@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber &quot;
the information on the boards should be suppl@@ emented by the Internet .
therefore at the site selection a good mobile network receiving a role .
also Acc@@ es@@ sibility is a crit@@ erion .
later the star path is to be extended by train .
&quot; on the observ@@ atory ad the vie@@ wers learn a lot of knowledge , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they learned different colors for why star would have different colors or why a star more lumin@@ aire than another , although he is much further away . &quot;
&quot; I will also be convey@@ ed in which con@@ stell@@ ation is a selected star , and when he is best to see . &quot;
the association has been operating since 2014 in the Berg@@ städ@@ t St. Andre@@ as@@ berg who occup@@ ies the highest observ@@ atory of North Germany since 2014 .
the central park in the heart of the National Park Har@@ z is one of the Federal Republic of Germany for the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
&quot; often , from there the milk street and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galaxy with blo@@ om eye can be seen clearly . &quot;
in the Un@@ i town there has been an initiative of the Planet@@ arium Gött@@ ingen something simil@@ arity like the planned Stern@@ en@@ wer@@ g - the plan@@ etary weg .
&quot; starting from Geb@@ h@@ ards Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ al@@ lee , which forms the interior of our solar system , leads the plan@@ etary way up to the Hain@@ berg and observ@@ atory - as well as a &quot; extr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( Municip@@ al ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the ste@@ els with the individual planets - including the d@@ warf @-@ plan@@ ed down@@ to at the end point - are exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth shr@@ unk so on a bowl of 6,5 milli@@ meters diameter , while the exact range of 75 meters away the sun is approximately 70 cen@@ tim@@ eters . &quot;
the total distance of plan@@ etary way is a good four kilometers .
&quot; while the light needed from sun to Plu@@ to about eight hours , ped@@ estri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot;
ped@@ estri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmo@@ s .
the march to the next fix@@ ings but would last yet a half year .
Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time to discuss a possible show@@ down
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia that should be in a coll@@ ecti@@ bles , in order to st@@ aging the most thr@@ illing boxes in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ finished World Box@@ ing Council lightweight Champion , the cor@@ ridor down to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Box@@ ing organization Super @-@ spring @-@ Champion Mare . &quot;
after Gar@@ ci@@ as victory through the vote of the former Vi@@ er @-@ Di@@ visions World Champion Adri@@ en Br@@ oner on Saturday at show@@ time both fighter members of the top @-@ Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ list .
Gar@@ cia stret@@ ched the right hand out and said : &quot; how does it go to you ? &quot;
I wish you a lot of luck . &quot;
Lom@@ a@@ enko has def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Marri@@ aga on Satur@@ day@@ evening at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
&quot; as the couple for photos posi@@ tively , noted Lom@@ a@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas that would be a possible show@@ down between the fighters that would be the &quot; perfect size &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former spring @-@ weight , &quot; remember@@ ed Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; I am for Br@@ oner &#91; on 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so great . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to go to lightweight .
and he must move to light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; to move and then fight .
we demand the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Kas@@ ach@@ enko .
&quot; box@@ ing needs this fight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Kli@@ ma asked if it should be on pay @-@ by @-@ view , part of a strategy , the Lom@@ ach@@ enko , with a 135 @-@ pound Debut of this year , in order to arrange a date ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) , who also interest in the fight against the winner of J@@ orge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their light@@ weight competition in the forum on September 23 . &quot;
&quot; this struggle could take place in Pay @-@ by @-@ View mode because all fans asked about him , &quot; said Gar@@ cia and oppressed themselves later to fight for the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
when always they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , he acknowled@@ ges Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , and he may possibly take part in his Saturday struggle . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko gave thanks to the solid praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he think the Thir@@ ty @-@ Champion champion from River@@ side are very slow , sorry , sorry Mik@@ ey ... you do test yes the co @-@ off . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , the focus is to show ming , then box@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; they both said , they could sense the Mom@@ thood , that sense themselves to the own battle . &quot;
&quot; this is the battle , which must be done . &quot;
no other struggle creates as much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work in this , &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko said : &quot; I have been waiting for the top fighters and that is Mik@@ ey .
it will be a great battle . &quot;
four Ver@@ ano according to tire @-@ space
&quot; in an accident on the A7 , on Thursday afternoon four people were heavily in@@ ju@@ red . &quot;
&quot; after first information , the driver lost a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira about 16.@@ 30 pm shortly before the junction market , probably the control over his vehicle . &quot;
&quot; the car dict@@ ated to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he was re@@ covered and then lying on the roof in the green strip . &quot;
the four passengers - two adults and two children - were difficult to hurt in the accident .
&quot; during the first supply of the last through the bail@@ out service , the A7 was locked towards the north for approximately one hour , then the traffic could be guided on the left hand side of the accident . &quot;
For@@ tun@@ as Hoff@@ mann : &quot; Trinity works better &quot;
And@@ re Hoff@@ mann hopes after the 2 : 2 for the opening clock against Braunschweig that brings the optimization of the def@@ ender in Au@@ e points .
&quot; with the first season And@@ re Hoff@@ mann was satisfied with the result , there were not the two oppos@@ ites at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two oppos@@ es too much and we need to better fit in Au@@ e nor better , &quot; says the defen@@ sive player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the triangle is to be optim@@ ised further .
and a gate after a free bre@@ ach the For@@ tun@@ es would also no longer want to be clear@@ ed .
for the future there will be no longer beside Michael ( R@@ ensing ) on line .
Hoff@@ mann is convinced that his team is better to cope with the experience in preparation with the triple .
&quot; still I don &apos;t know how we are to act in Au@@ e , but Hoff@@ mann is confident of his cause , &quot; because we just spent in the triple positions at the semi @-@ positions in KA@@ AN Ay@@ han and N@@ iko Pen@@ el@@ mann players who can well build good , &quot; said Hoff@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; the requirement is , but that we are even better harmon@@ ize and we don &apos;t afford to build so many play@@ sites . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoff@@ mann travels to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but if one cannot speak to a mis@@ guided start , don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance might be quite okay , &quot; &quot; said Hoff@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; if we can go on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the Pok@@ al , we will certainly be able to speak from a decent season . &quot;
it wanted to know his trainers nothing .
&quot; the start into the season Be@@ ur@@ ries I only after six to eight game days , &quot; he said of a advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be abandoned pre@@ matur@@ ely because of a bum@@ per . &quot;
&quot; now she can start the season qu@@ asi with a home game , &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoff@@ mann believes that players from Au@@ e may even be something fresh , since they had no heavy and complete play like Fort@@ una against a ascent . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know that 100 @-@ process where they are currently standing , &quot; says the inner def@@ ender of the Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; although the guests from the Rhineland as a lighter favorite on Sunday to the meeting in finally ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we take them away , only because we have the claim to come under the first six , is Bl@@ ö@@ d@@ ness , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance sheet is at only a defeat against au@@ e from nine games really positive . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga which one has to hit by pre@@ domin@@ antly , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as Ch@@ ef@@ coach . &quot;
&quot; to meet such a statement , arro@@ gan@@ t would be arro@@ gan@@ t and Hebrew . &quot;
and so station@@ el wants to watch his players on Sunday in no case .
new results of the Swedish asylum seek@@ ers published
&quot; the recent findings of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which have been subj@@ ected to a new method for the medical evaluation of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the people were older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish Agency for For@@ ensic medicine ( Soviet medic@@ inal ) has started out with the performance of the tests last year .
&quot; you are supposed to make the assessment of the age of asylum , after the Swedish mig@@ rant authority ( migration short@@ cuts ) because of errors in ass@@ essing the correct age of some refugees was cri@@ tici@@ zed , the min@@ der@@ years were . &quot;
&quot; up to date , Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ short@@ ened 6.@@ 880 on test cases , and the For@@ ensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total 2,@@ 481 tests from the period from mid March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; eight@@ y percent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older , while in other 25 cases the For@@ ensic Medicine Agency involve the person &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in general cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; possibly is under 18 years old .
the tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is ques@@ tioned .
&quot; according to Joh@@ an Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ ensic Medicine Agency , the results are resistant in the past months . &quot;
&quot; we do not see a big difference in statistics of the past months , the numbers are quite constant , &quot; he said of the magazine The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high proportion of cases , which has been assessed as over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has weigh@@ ed over his age . &quot;
&quot; in May , the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there are 442 cases to give the &quot; propose person 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bl@@ a@@ det the 581 published results , she asked that in 243 of these cases the person had openly told that she will be in this year 18 years old . &quot;
&quot; the method of the medical estim@@ ation division , in the ray recordings of wisdom and MR@@ T recordings are analy@@ zed by knee b@@ anners and radi@@ ologists , was also cri@@ tici@@ zed in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a sc@@ ep@@ tics is the end@@ oc@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute , whose work covers the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see whether she sooner or later than usual through pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used . &quot;
the biological age to judge in this way is very un@@ safe .
&quot; if we cannot say it certainly , we should not do so as if we could , &quot; he said the paper Metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ sch@@ sson was def@@ ended by the For@@ ensic Medicine Agency however , however , the accuracy of the tests : &quot; generally you can say that the risk to judge a child as an adult . &quot;
&quot; the biggest risk is in that if the person is under 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in plan
the work on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg come well ahead .
on Wednesday a seven tons of he@@ ap is installed on the bridge at the eastern part of the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very well located in the time , it runs great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , buil@@ ders at the department of traffic and traffic in the government of the government of Freiburg . &quot;
in April the works started at all three san@@ itation needs between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is planned for October and Lei@@ cht is certain that the schedule will be respected .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a v@@ aul@@ ted bridge from concrete , which is fin@@ ed with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein , and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters . &quot;
built in 1900 .
&quot; as the two other bridges , she has now come into the years . &quot;
&quot; to ensure the stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thorough . &quot;
the two other bridges lead to the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built in red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 meters long . &quot;
the bridge on the outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach now has obtained the Wednesday @-@ tomorrow on the north side a 1,30 metres wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called brow@@ n@@ appe .
&quot; this is a side forti@@ fication , which is also used as a factory . &quot;
on the southern part of the bridge the bridge is to be used on Friday a 2.@@ 20 meters wide box .
it should then go out of the pedestrian streets .

critical stew@@ art talks about her bis@@ exual
&quot; some people love gr@@ illed cheese , and will eat him until the end of their lives . &quot;
&quot; but I want to try everything , so Kri@@ sten Stew@@ art quite openly about their bis@@ exual . &quot;
&quot; if I once in gr@@ illed cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes as neighb@@ our ? &apos; . &quot;
the most well @-@ known relationship of the Hot@@ stars was the one to her &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ in@@ son who ultimately dropped bitter .

&quot; after their separation was Kri@@ sten that she was bis@@ exual , &quot; &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed in du@@ alism . &quot;
so it has never conf@@ used to conf@@ used .
I never liked it to be taken seriously .
&quot; especially among them they suffered according to &quot; Bang Show@@ biz &quot; &quot; but in the school time , when they prefer to be like a bu@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really has been very in@@ ju@@ red .
&quot; when I had eleven , I would like the children , I would look like a bu@@ b . &quot;
I really felt attacked and dam@@ p .
&quot; now I returned and think me : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
&quot; especially the public , she does not like to live her love : &quot; people expect you in a certain way and the anno@@ yed me . &quot;
&quot; and perhaps ask me some as and@@ ank@@ able , but I don &apos;t like to justi@@ fy me before all the public . &quot;

&quot; the world leader of the athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , pra@@ ised on Thursday , what he described as an open un@@ expl@@ oration from Russia to a d@@ oping sc@@ andal but he repeti@@ tive , it was not the moment for the country to be recorded again in sport . &quot;
Russia dancing leader D@@ mit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin said during the I@@ A@@ AF Congress at the eve of the athle@@ tics World Championships that was correct to fight his country from the sport and that he decided to fight the d@@ oping .
&quot; he said , I tu@@ e him sorry for &quot; all ath@@ letes , those in competitions gold and silver med@@ als were car@@ ved . &quot;

&quot; I thought it was today a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said I@@ A@@ AF @-@ president Co@@ e the Re@@ por@@ tern . &quot;
&quot; the entire Council and the entire congress was pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized themselves that they have experienced some pretty hot times , and everything imagin@@ able will do to ensure that the Federation will be re@@ designed . &quot;
&quot; Co@@ e said , he is also &quot; &quot; pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ launch . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been achieved , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we must do everything in the next months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot;
the principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean ath@@ letes from the dep@@ ra@@ ved system he added

&quot; the Queen may agree with the decision of her husband , it was in the message . &quot;
&quot; where prince Hen@@ rik buried , be still un@@ clear . &quot;
but he did not have the intention to be placed in his French homeland .
prince Hen@@ rik never had a fl@@ our of it that he was not happy with his title .
after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would like to be king .
2016 he went to retirement and also places the title &apos; princ@@ esses &apos; .
&quot; Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and the function he wanted to see himself from his wife , and not after death , said L@@ ene Ball@@ eby , the Ch@@ ef@@ arian of the Danish kings . &quot;
where the last retirement of the 83 @-@ year will ultimately be un@@ clear either .
&quot; but he did not have the intention to become in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;

on the Th@@ ames he worked in the French message .
&quot; during his later wife the sympath@@ iz@@ ings of the people always fle@@ w , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand at the D@@ eign state . &quot;
&quot; in a auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik over the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival was everything I did , cri@@ tici@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was aw@@ ful , I preferred wine instead of beer , soap instead of kn@@ itted , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I was in place of Virginia @-@ tobacco , and the herein had to be the reputation to be the brand based military int@@ ellec@@ tu@@ als , I could not hope to hope . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not ash@@ amed .
these were just two mistakes ! &quot;

agricultural Minister in an interview - How do we protect ourselves from Gi@@ ft@@ ones , Mr Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discussed over se@@ ated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
agricultural Minister Christian Schmidt ( C@@ SU ) stands in interview with the Red@@ response network Germany ( R@@ N@@ D ) speech and answer .
&quot; Mr Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from po@@ ison@@ ed eggs ? &quot;
&quot; I can only encourage consumer rights and consumers , to view the eggs in your refrigerator to look exactly and review the push pressure . &quot;
on consumer protection portal www.@@ food war@@ n@@ ay represent the federal states the most recent information about the affected eggs .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if according to everything we currently know , a health haz@@ ard practically is excluded . &quot;
&quot; now Al@@ di is taking over the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the appreciation from the Federal Minister of Federal Minister not really percei@@ ved ? &quot;
the food surveillance is the task of the federal states .
&quot; nevertheless , my house is un@@ ched immediately and has since announcement of the amounts of Germany in close interaction with the authorities of the countries . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
&quot; the trade has just as to bear the makers to ensure that the sold @-@ selling products for the sold , and health@@ ful un@@ imagin@@ able . &quot;
&quot; when at eggs the back@@ ward content of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exc@@ eeded . &quot;
Un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time is not the farms to blame .
sit and consumers in the same boat ?
after the recent knowledge the production facilities meets no immediate fault .
&quot; rather , they must count on due to mut@@ ually illegal practices of service companies with economic damages . &quot;
as always there is too little cont@@ rol@@ le@@ ure .
is it only lacking in the personnel or also on the conc@@ ile jurisdiction ?
&quot; however , there were just the official checks that have un@@ covered the process . &quot;
&quot; however , for truth , food fraud and criminal energy cannot be excluded up to 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; this is why there is a consequ@@ ent clari@@ fication of such events and the hand@@ over to state lawyers in the cases where criminal off@@ ences can occur , of decisive significance . &quot;
&quot; I have already made several times a lot , that I expect the competent authorities to expect a complete clari@@ fication . &quot;
is the regular Al@@ ar@@ mis@@ m at food sk@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
the consumer rights and consumers have the right to get safe and easy @-@ to @-@ use foods .
&quot; if a non @-@ established insec@@ tici@@ de is used in the food industry , consumer rights and consumers are un@@ heard . &quot;
&quot; by the solid remedy are manufacturers , distributors and consumers in a situation which is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; fundament@@ ally , the illegal use of the insec@@ tici@@ de Fi@@ pr@@ oni@@ l is not acceptable in the position of the insec@@ tici@@ des animals and must be termin@@ ated immediately . &quot;
&quot; in this case , it must be consistent with high pressure on all levels . &quot;
I expect from all the competent authorities that the atom@@ ic clari@@ fied and mis@@ er@@ able .
how to impact the financial rules of Foot@@ ball on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Move to Paris
&quot; the rules that dism@@ is@@ sed to avoid di@@ min@@ ished issues of European so@@ ccer field , N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord @-@ transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain . &quot;
&quot; any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the U@@ EF@@ A , because the conduc@@ tive organization controlled the European game has to offer the power , cre@@ ws from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
financial Fair @-@ Play @-@ rules that have been launched by the U@@ EF@@ A in 2011 means that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar must be financed without major losses .
&quot; Barcelona has 222 million euros ( 262 million $ ) , to store the Bra@@ zili@@ ans from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a sal@@ ary that will be several ten million dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Move to France .
&quot; PSG you can make sure to make money the money , thus N@@ ey@@ mar , and bring him into a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team through the energy of rich rul@@ er@@ family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; associations may apply to a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but must oppos@@ e with legi@@ timate insights about , which allow them to make the Bre@@ ak @-@ E@@ ven point in her on the football @-@ related business . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel plat@@ ini after his election to the U@@ EF@@ A President in 2007 .
&quot; the former French players believed that clubs which in their quest for success have taken tremendous deb@@ ts upon themselves , effectively frau@@ dul@@ ge and ris@@ ky to ru@@ in , if banks or owner went back to their support . &quot;
in 2011 FF@@ P fell from concentration on the deb@@ ts of the clubs on the monitoring of their losses .
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the novel A@@ br@@ amo@@ vi@@ ch originally used 2003 in Chelsea , used to build a club with potential and then power@@ fully invested to build the team and establish a global brand . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P release period , which runs until 2018 , clubs are able to accept losses in height of 30 million euros . &quot;
&quot; and although plat@@ ini 2015 was like from the pres@@ idency in Un@@ g@@ nade , his U@@ EF@@ A @-@ successor to A@@ lek@@ s@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to take part of over@@ dis@@ counted expenditure . &quot;
&quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will set up the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so that is responsible for the U@@ EF@@ A for FF@@ P , towards The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week . &quot;
&quot; although the PSG has paid the buy @-@ out @-@ cl@@ ause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing on the duration of his contract . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year agreement , so that the sol@@ ub@@ le solution can be assigned for the next five years in the amount of 4@@ 4,@@ 4 million euros in the annual financial statements . &quot;
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has the PSG with Abu Dhabi which is owned by Manchester City .
&quot; the PSG received a money penalty of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which has been reduced to 20 million euros , and it has been arranged for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 to 21 players instead of normal 25 players . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ EF@@ A is searching for K@@ lu@@ bs , who could try to over@@ look their financial contribution by companies taking their earnings by companies that are connected to the owners of a club . &quot;
&quot; while a cat@@ ar@@ ic company could collect the PSG - if the value of sponsorship should exceed the standard mark@@ ings , the U@@ EF@@ A would not be regarded as legi@@ timate income . &quot;
this happened in 2014 as the U@@ EF@@ A decided that the value of sponsorship of P@@ SA was imposed by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it has been reported that part of the PSG - payments to N@@ ey@@ mar may come across payments of the Organis@@ ational Committee of the World Cup in Qatar .
&quot; however , PSG and Kat@@ ar 2022 have pro@@ gres@@ sed that N@@ ey@@ mar WM amb@@ assador will simply be out and such man@@ eu@@ ver for the U@@ EF@@ A regul@@ ators authorities could simply be out . &quot;
the previous sanctions against PSG ProntoSIL that the U@@ EF@@ A will be more attention to consider each attempt to handle the rules .
&quot; the U@@ EF@@ A had no pre @-@ prepared discussions with PSG on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , fabulous on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
they said to discuss the condition of an@@ onym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press as they were not be@@ aten the PSG ProntoSIL situation .
the last published reports indicate that PSG 2015 / 16 with a turnover of 54@@ 2,@@ 4 million euros have achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros . &quot;

PSG - expect N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival a blessing for sponsorship De@@ als , Mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and Tri@@ kot@@ eller . &quot;
the association is assum@@ ing that the turnover after signing at least 30 per cent will increase .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly ir@@ rit@@ ated to see one of the best so@@ ccer player , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s trail to prevent it declar@@ es that PSG the FF@@ P was viol@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial d@@ oping &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of La Liga , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in terms of Kat@@ ar the latter owner . &quot;
&quot; ar@@ sen@@ al Manager Arsen@@ e W@@ enger , whose association is owned by an American sport Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La Liga with a state that financed a association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the owner and this has completely changed the entire landscape of the Foot@@ ball in the last 15 years , &quot; said W@@ enger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; as soon as a country has a club , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it is very difficult to respect the finance fair@@ play , because you have different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is searching for a new Sch@@ og@@ gi@@ suppliers
in the past years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y Bord chocolate is made available for Swiss Life .
&quot; now , the committees is close to a possible end : the airline is writing the job . &quot;
Swiss @-@ spok@@ es@@ person Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rap confirmed on request of the news agency S@@ DA a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; North @-@ speaking Switzerland &quot; from Friday .
the current planning will be a new contract during the first half of 2018 .
the products would have been reviewed every two or three years and under@@ taking quality control .
&quot; with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
some 17 million small red @-@ white s@@ og@@ g@@ it@@ af@@ for@@ ks are spread to 14 grams per year the flight @-@ accompanying before the land@@ ing to the passengers .
about the cost the Swiss no data wanted to do .
&quot; branch divisions estimate the order volume &quot; &quot; North @-@ speaking Switzerland &quot; &quot; on 1.5 to 2 million Swiss fran@@ cs - the mig@@ ros @-@ daughter achiev@@ es an annual turnover of around one billion fran@@ cs . &quot;
but more important is all@@ em@@ al of the promotional effects : for a Sch@@ og@@ gi@@ al manufacturer it is a prestigious order .
&quot; how many applic@@ ants there are in the new tender , Swiss will not betra@@ y the Swiss Life . &quot;
but only Swiss producers are coming in question .
&quot; according to the timeframe , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to strive for a renewal of the Treaty on Spring 2018 . &quot;
for the S@@ DA the largest Swiss Cho@@ colate manufacturer was not accessible for an opinion .
chocolate @-@ tables spread the Swiss Life on board their flights since 2006 .
&quot; before the Swiss a contract concluded with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry Call@@ eb@@ aut had delivered in collaboration with Hu@@ g the chocolate tablets . &quot;
&quot; the possibility to place the logo , led Swiss before two and half years with the start of cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;
the airline works together with different Swiss Cho@@ colate manufacturers .
&quot; on long @-@ hau@@ l flights , the customers of the First Class with L@@ eck@@ ties are spoiled by the Con@@ fis@@ ery Sp@@ ong@@ gli , in Business Class N@@ il@@ gi from lind@@ t and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;

&quot; this repeti@@ tion of history is at the same time no@@ stal@@ g@@ ically because of the glori@@ ous days of the characters of 80 @-@ he years , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ Gr@@ ungs @-@ era ( as the pre@@ den@@ ker David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ ers die Sk@@ etch @-@ Com@@ edy &quot; &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d to bigger things . &quot;

blow against drugs of the country in the country
the police is a blow against the Italian Maf@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning we were found in the Black @-@ B@@ aar @-@ district , in Rot@@ t@@ because , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen , Germany and Stuttgart numerous objects , such as the prosec@@ ution of Con@@ stance on Friday . &quot;
&quot; at the age of 15 , 15 complaint at the age of 25 and 77 was arrested and already ar@@ rest against this . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the officials of larger amounts of mari@@ juana and Kok@@ ain , Sch@@ uss@@ ine as well as several hundreds of hundreds . &quot;
at the time of simultaneous Raz@@ ors in Italy two persons were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ected Itali@@ ans there were German ar@@ rest warran@@ t .
the two are probably delivered to Germany after Germany .
in the action were Italian and Bayer@@ ische Er@@ ator .
&quot; in total , more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Maf@@ ia is organised crime criminal , heavy violence , dec@@ ei@@ ved murder and rob@@ ber@@ y and em@@ be@@ zz@@ lement . &quot;
&quot; already since summer 2016 , the prosec@@ ution of Con@@ stance against the organised crime trade in the south @-@ German region . &quot;
&quot; between the prosec@@ ution in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo , there was a re@@ fu@@ ge exchange and the investig@@ ator of the cri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ because they had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the large @-@ use on Wednesday @-@ tomorrow was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo . &quot;

way reb@@ ates big g@@ aps in the for@@ eig@@ ners
&quot; data from citizens that should not arise . &quot; &quot; a report that the for@@ eig@@ ner register in Germany has significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot;
the lead to partly gra@@ zing failure in asylum procedure .
&quot; the en@@ voy for the fuge@@ e management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen , has been attentive to a media report on large g@@ aps in the Aus@@ län@@ der@@ cent@@ ric register . &quot;
&quot; short@@ com@@ ings during the registered data could lead in asylum procedure and deport@@ ations &quot; to partly gra@@ zing fail@@ ures , &quot; war@@ ned manner in an analysis that is the &quot; South German newspaper &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the register , the information is estimated ten million people with foreign citi@@ zenship , including about 5,@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU states . &quot;
the data are administ@@ ered by approximately 600 for@@ eig@@ der@@ ers in Germany .
because the data has not been kept enough for the data quality in parts so far .
&quot; in certain cases the data of 1921 have been found , &quot; &quot; of people who have long been no longer in life , or by citizens , the German citizen @-@ citizens , and in the register no longer should arise . &quot;
faul@@ ty data inputs can be significantly slow@@ down significantly , it means the report to continue . &quot;
&quot; in statistics of char@@ geable people , the EU citizens do not have to travel . &quot;
&quot; but such wrong assign@@ ments resulted in a dist@@ ort@@ ed debate about dealing with charges , &quot; it says in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the federal government has begun to return to Italy for re@@ fuge@@ e families with under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children , when they came from there . &quot;
&quot; it deri@@ ves from an internal paper of the Federal Council for Migration and refugees ( BA@@ MF ) , the &quot; New Osn@@ ab@@ ret@@ er Zeitung reports . &quot;
&quot; in the paper , the BA@@ MF guides such procedures &quot; for families with children - except bags and small@@ children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this is practically no longer possible , the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation on site . &quot;
&quot; following the Dublin agreement is responsible for refugees from the EU state , which they first reach . &quot;
&quot; if a migration is forward to another EU country , this state can send it into the immig@@ rant . &quot;
&quot; for the reason , office now : &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the recording capacity for families with less @-@ old children in Italy has increased substantially . &quot;
Italy have been handed down for inclusion and accommodation for families .
&quot; even the European Court of Human Rights ( EG@@ MR ) , this promise for sufficient . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; other EU states would return to refugees in the context of Dublin agreement . &quot;
&quot; the inter@@ iors of the left @-@ fr@@ action in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ lic@@ ke , cri@@ tici@@ zed this decision : &quot; families with children , because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian Asyl@@ um system Human Rights and a Compan@@ ions of the Kind@@ ling . &quot;
second @-@ best results
a total of 220 lit@@ res blood of in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach living persons introduced the blood @-@ long service to other people .
&quot; at least by the twelve citizens , which were awarded on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , Jürgen Gre@@ ule , which has now been participating 50 liter blood with its meantime 100 donations . &quot;
&quot; traditional sp@@ ends the church in the meeting of the community , the multi@@ ples willingness to don@@ ate blood . &quot;
&quot; it is awesome how our body is created for it and we z@@ ol@@ len the spher@@ es respect that their blood for stran@@ gers are still in@@ trin@@ si@@ bly , under@@ lined may@@ or Karl@@ hein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood @-@ end helps people &quot; &quot; explain the Kreis@@ ler manager of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ C ) , Hol@@ ger Ma@@ is@@ enb@@ acher , because the preser@@ ves are broken down into their components . &quot;
thus three people could benefit from a blood @-@ track .
&quot; simultaneously , Ma@@ is@@ enb@@ acher reported by the actions that are carried out in spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved with 114 Sp@@ ins the second @-@ best result , &quot; said the DR@@ C @-@ Kreis@@ ler manager . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change in a theatre set before a few years ago has led to higher groups . &quot;
&quot; already before that Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Sch@@ ö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Meta relocation to the multi@@ pl@@ ums and were awarded for 50 hours . &quot;
&quot; half so many , Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tamara P@@ from@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter ten times per 500 milli@@ liter from their life of life . &quot;
the Bank of England will keep the interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
&quot; the Bank of England will likely to be announced later that the interest rates remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation the spec@@ ulation should have fought a rise . &quot;
&quot; the Bank of England has war@@ ned that economic growth &quot; comp@@ uting &quot; will remain , when they managed the interest rates on family income in the middle of an increased pressure . &quot;
&quot; the policy decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 for keeping interest rates on 0,@@ 25 % , whereas this month less members will increase an increase , since the weak economic growth has led to an increase . &quot;
&quot; in their quar@@ terly inflation , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 on 1.@@ 7 % and for 2018 on 1.6 % and war@@ ned that the pressure on the household would continue to continue , whereby inflation in autumn is expected to rise to almost 3 % . &quot;
&quot; but they sign@@ alized that in the next few years of interest are necessary to bre@@ ach from the Bre@@ x@@ it , and she said that the loans would cost much more than expected to rise to the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; the members agreed also to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mut Congress , which was issued prior to the Bre@@ x@@ it after a year after the Bre@@ x@@ it . &quot;
&quot; it will demand time for the financial institutions to provide financial funds for banks , although said that it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds in the framework of this system - with 115 billion pound ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank : &quot; &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , the gross domestic product ( B@@ IP ) will remain weak , since pressure on the real income of households will continue to use the consumption . &quot;
&quot; said to the interest rates that &quot; &quot; a certain criminal on monetary policy &quot; &quot; is required for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; &quot; greater &quot; &quot; scale &quot; &quot; than the markets awa@@ it . &quot;
the markets pro@@ gressi@@ ves the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; however , the Bank stressed however , that enh@@ anc@@ ements &quot; be gradu@@ al &quot; and &quot; limited . &quot; &quot;
the Bank has correc@@ ted the growth forecasts of the Bank for this and next year compared to that in May pro@@ gn@@ os@@ tiz@@ ers 1.@@ 9 % and 1.9 % .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 percent in 2018 .
the pound fell to these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell to 0.@@ 4 % on 1.@@ 11 euros .
&quot; the decision to no change comes , after the recent dis@@ appoint@@ ing growth will have fought the rising expectations on a rate of interest , and the GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % increased to 0.3 % in the previous three months . &quot;
&quot; growth is expected in the third quarter of 0.3 % , although it is easy to recover after the bank at the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the recent Infl@@ ative report offered little enthusiasm for households , which will be affected by an increasing inflation and reduced sal@@ ts since the shar@@ pen@@ ing first will be worse , before they become better . &quot;
&quot; they added that monetary policy in the coming years may not prevent the income from the income , &quot; but they added that the wages for the end of their three @-@ year pro@@ gn@@ osis . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pound rather , which is compens@@ ated for a part of lower consensus . &quot;
&quot; the decision comes after lower@@ ing of interest rates on 0,@@ 25 % in the last August after the sho@@ cking EU @-@ vote which condem@@ n the sin@@ ks of the path . &quot;
the bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy .
&quot; before the final jud@@ gement of the Bank to the interest rates , the call was increased after a tick bite , since the inflation was increased pressure on har@@ sh bud@@ gets , with three political decision @-@ makers in July an increase on 0,5 % demanded . &quot;
&quot; inflation is decre@@ ased last month of 2,@@ 9 % in June at 2,@@ 6 % , although the bank said that this was expected and will come back in the coming months . &quot;
the bank said to write the transi@@ tions in relation to their goal of 2 % be &quot; quite &quot; of a weak pound . &quot;
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; given the short@@ est back of Sw@@ ap year , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive once the l@@ ending options are looking for shops and would like the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market looks especially good for those who run the existing De@@ als and the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming popular . &quot;
NH@@ S ( The National Health Service ) should be contro@@ versi@@ al HIV @-@ Dro@@ ge 10,000 people write
patients will receive access to a struggle before the High Court against the financing of the drug with the NH@@ S access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment .
&quot; NH@@ S England announced that one before the sexual intercourse pac@@ ed pre@@ ex@@ position ( pre@@ p ) which can reduce the Inf@@ ection ris@@ iko at high risk assessment by around 86 percent , now by health service over a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he declared to finance the trial , after the Ap@@ pe@@ al court confirmed a judgment of the Supre@@ me Court of Justice , which had to pay the powers that the NH@@ S had to pay for the pre@@ p despite the asser@@ tion that the local authorities should finance it . &quot;
&quot; the chess was announced on Thursday by NH@@ S England Chef Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; during the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bright@@ on , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield are becoming the first one that will be en@@ forced by people and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ ex@@ position phy@@ la@@ xe ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission of inf@@ ectious diseases .
pre@@ p pre@@ p prior to intercourse signi@@ fies that just enough drugs in the body of a person are present to prevent an HIV infection .
such drugs can be taken every day or even two hours before intercourse .
those who belong to the treatment belong to the treatment belong to gay or bis@@ exual men who have not been successfully treated with HIV @-@ positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
&quot; in clinics , adequate participants will identify the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status will not be controlled by Anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral treatment . &quot;
&quot; people who are living in England and registered with a household , can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sexu@@ al@@ clinic . &quot;
the program will receive £ 10 million and NH@@ S England signed a contract for delivery of drugs this week after an international competitive purchase .
&quot; the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p , as well as clinical trials , as it is implemented in large scale and implemented . &quot;
&quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to reduce HIV and over@@ hau@@ l . &quot;
it is another milestone in which more than three decades continued adv@@ ancement in addressing one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive on NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , if it is targeted towards the needs and vulnerable people , the possibility to change the English HIV @-@ epid@@ emic . &quot;
&quot; from September to people with high HIV risk access to this NH@@ S @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument , which is really controlled and not with a negoti@@ ation with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we welcome you to this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , CEO , Member of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority has to be performed quickly throughout the country and that no one has to withdraw the risk for HIV . &quot;
&quot; now , since the pre@@ p @-@ Test@@ medicine was created , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected persons . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , shadow @-@ health minist@@ erial , said : &quot; &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due to the government at the start of the pre@@ p process . &quot;
the evidence show how transform@@ ing this drug as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can termin@@ ate the transmission of this lifetime infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected , and that it will contribute to the pro@@ gression of HIV in society a step closer . &quot;
life living : me@@ zz@@ anine and cle@@ ver@@ e designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a solid home .
&quot; Jo@@ anne L@@ eigh , a former bank@@ er with a passion for real estate , re@@ acted in 2014 from a large house in K@@ nights@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment . &quot;
&quot; it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design , that Jo@@ anne does not packed their bags and sold . &quot;
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in K@@ nights@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
I looked after something that was comparable to my price .
&quot; I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and it had the same high ceil@@ ings . &quot;
I loved it in them and made an offer on that day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square @-@ feet has been completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
&quot; originally a A @-@ room estate with a closed layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add jo@@ anne storage space and a me@@ zz@@ anine to enjoy the generous ceiling height . &quot;
&quot; I wanted high ceil@@ ings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; this was my requirement , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; to this end she asked the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill , the 12.5 feet high ceil@@ ings and to create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the blan@@ ket was not large enough to place two rooms over@@ each other , so that the architectural challenge was to create a me@@ zz@@ anine in which one could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan has had to think to resolve the task .
&quot; the ste@@ el@@ work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the spaces so that they were over@@ exposed to each other , without that we had to g@@ aps us . &quot;
&quot; it was not just about to build a simple platform , but the steel so anz@@ ul@@ ously , that he had for the function above or down the right height . &quot;
this arrangement made it Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height over@@ sight - with a lot of extra drama .
for the me@@ zz@@ anine a class@@ room looks down by Retro@@ u@@ vi@@ us on the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
&quot; mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver@@ ne acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program . &quot;
the use of mirr@@ ors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
a short cor@@ ridor is mirr@@ ored to make it longer .
in the kitchen the mirr@@ oring like a window into another room .
at the entrance we offer space for all seating and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
&quot; through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room may shut the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
Coll@@ ap@@ sible kitchens are nothing new .
the Special at this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of Ingenie@@ ur@@ kunst went out , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the ste@@ amp@@ ed , fur@@ ni@@ fied MD@@ F door . &quot;
&quot; it is not important , so that when you slide the door very easily . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to gain an additional 16 m ² , an extra bedroom and a improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the base area - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ ary form , a real estate mac@@ mak@@ ler enter and perform a calculation based on the bottom size . &quot;
&quot; here , they managed to enlarge the surface area and use the same high quality materials that provide space with its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you tou@@ ching and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you do not worship you into the electric plug @-@ in , in the walls . &quot;
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment is characterized by good design and increased square met@@ er@@ ation of slightly standard in something very amazing .

&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the Dy@@ nasty , in a confront@@ ation because of one of the largest property imperi@@ al Vict@@ ori@@ as worth over 500 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; the former Director of the Carl@@ ton @-@ Foot@@ ball @-@ Club &apos; and developers Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . it has brought him to the Supre@@ me Court to clari@@ fy how their property and their assets shall be split . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw himself from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp examination of the separation will take place in the Supre@@ me Court of Justice . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers 38 real estate has collected a value of more than half billion dollars , since the family 1973 a shop in the Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood , bought . &quot;
&quot; there , the family of West@@ co Je@@ ans founded and grew up to a chain of 160 retail shops . &quot;
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now comprises offices in city centre , the development areas of Brun@@ swi@@ ck and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and M@@ t Bul@@ ler and shopping centres in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; after an agreement with its dec@@ eased father , Col@@ in - von Paul is described as &quot; main operator and the domin@@ ating personality &quot; &quot; in the family De Lu@@ tis - about two @-@ third of the company &apos;s business and Paul approximately one third . &quot;
the juris@@ pru@@ dence that this means that Col@@ in Property has been owned by 316 million dollars and Paul worth $ 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has turned out for Paul as a issues .
&quot; those proposed by Col@@ in proposed lifts have left him with which I kept for the best objects , he wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it . &quot;
on the last Friday the first hearing of the Supre@@ me Court of Justice took place on the last Friday .
&quot; the brothers are now fighting for control over the existing business - from Col@@ in , such as Paul claimed to have him excluded . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in ar@@ gues , this is not true , but thro@@ ws Paul before , some owners of in@@ compet@@ ently . &quot;
&quot; in an early Aff@@ id@@ av@@ it , which was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hope to settle the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage writes before that the family is the most important priority , he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cost rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and charter K@@ eck C@@ ram@@ er , and with leading Law@@ yers , including All@@ an My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her ver@@ stor@@ yt@@ er E@@ hem@@ ann Luigi were Italian immig@@ rants , the milk bars and delicacies made up a shop in Brun@@ swi@@ ck . &quot;
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood sofa bed in the Col@@ in the first Je@@ ans@@ i family .
&quot; Col@@ in says that he began West@@ co there when he was the High School , when Paul was a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi who died in 2012 were hop@@ ed to ad@@ mit her property to their sons in 2012 .
&quot; Luigi often said to me , that he never wanted to land the brothers before judgment , she wrote them . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis @-@ Group , whereby Col@@ in claims that Mark at the end of the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars have been paid . &quot;
&quot; Luke as well as Mark , Paul said Paul &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in has kept very back , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a Biography from the year 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of television stars . &quot;
Fair@@ fax Media participated with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyer .
only col@@ in rep@@ lied by SMS to say &apos; I really cannot say much &quot; because the case before the courts may be .
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to compl@@ ain me and draw our sur@@ name through the courts , he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of 2016 , Col@@ in in a letter to the court that he tries to fulfill the demands of his brother . &quot;
&quot; our Father would not have arous@@ ed that Paul and I would like to end in our current dispute , he said and added that he still hope to hope for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be past .
&quot; our matter will be solved in the near future by the courts , wrote Col@@ in . &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s new Stab@@ ach@@ ef is planning to restri@@ ct the media ab@@ st@@ in@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and have failed .
maybe John F. Kelly I can actually do .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico reported that the new Stab@@ ili@@ zer of the White House is planning to restri@@ ct the information flow on President Tru@@ mp - including the reports of news media - in hope to keep the boss on a moderate course . &quot;
here is a piece of Re@@ porter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Stab@@ ili@@ zer of the White House , at his first working day , he introduced a main problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s White House , which he choos@@ es rep@@ aired , bad information that turned into the hands of the president . &quot;
&quot; Kelly said the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in letters , because the President would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense but others have tried to don@@ ate Tru@@ mp by watching his media staff .
&quot; President Tru@@ mp@@ s relationship with television reaches decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV @-@ advertising is still strong . &quot;
&quot; when Candi@@ date Tru@@ mp was negoti@@ ated because of an un@@ fair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of places received , &quot; said the former elect@@ oral consultant Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February towards police . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote on the time that &quot; the key , Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter hab@@ it under control , according to six former election campaign to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a ste@@ ady praise . &quot;
okay .
&quot; but the idea that Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter hab@@ it ever &quot; &quot; under control &quot; , &quot; is ri@@ dic@@ ulous . &quot;
perhaps this struggle is something that we do not know others - that Tru@@ mp@@ s Twe@@ ets do without their intervention even more cal@@ ories .
&quot; we will probably never experience something about the Twe@@ ets , the Tru@@ mp has not sent . &quot;
&quot; when his staff made it a few times , anger of wor@@ ries from him , then their efforts have been worth@@ while . &quot;
but nobody has consistently able to prevent the Tru@@ mp Cont@@ ro@@ ver@@ sen .
&quot; part of the problem consists of that people in a White House , which continues to compete out of comp@@ eting parties , always try to present their own agenda by giving Tru@@ mp material that might be able to promote their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the pre@@ ference of consultants , giving the President of strategic reasons to bring about strategic reasons . &quot;
this was an example that was described by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tru@@ mp @-@ officials say that Tru@@ mp can react like a volcano on negative values , especially such with sh@@ ame@@ ful Lec@@ tures , and that he will find out to know where these origin@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; this happened at the end of February , when someone took a printed copy of an article by Got@@ New@@ s.com , the website of the Internet @-@ Prov@@ ocation , the website of the Internet @-@ Prov@@ ocation , the website of the Internet @-@ Prov@@ ocation , who were acc@@ ustom@@ ed to his he@@ aps in Kati@@ e Wal@@ sh , &quot; the spring behind a hur@@ st of Lec@@ tures &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson did permanently burned out from Twitter , or that he has offered no specific evidence or that he cri@@ tici@@ des in the past and rede@@ em them . &quot;
Tru@@ mp las the article and started to ask employees about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold macher added that the previous Stab@@ sch@@ ef Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; have tried to implement a system to manage and document the Tru@@ mp . &quot;
how did the folded ?
Kelly tried three months later to do the same .
&quot; perhaps he will prove to prove to be more effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his impul@@ se self , and his consultants are still influenced by influence . &quot;
these un@@ change@@ able factors make cell@@ ys mission very difficult .
Master Se@@ aling Ver@@ bre@@ cher get Post by Euro@@ pol
&quot; as the address is unknown , the ten@@ ders of the population will pray and hop@@ ing . &quot;
the police in all Europe are shipped in this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards on dangerous criminal on the run .
&quot; as the addresses of the requested heav@@ y@@ boards are not known , information from the population is hop@@ ing and pra@@ ying . &quot;
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action that followed the &quot; EU Most W@@ anted &quot; Christmas calendar of winter .
&quot; the experiences had shown that many excursions are sold to holiday destinations , it was from Euro@@ pol . &quot;
we compiled 21 post@@ cards for search@@ ed bre@@ ach from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 , it has been the website of www.e@@ um@@ ost@@ s , more than 2.5 million times have been viewed . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online equipment could not be arrested , at least eleven thereof due to hin@@ ts after the publication on the website . &quot;
travelers negoti@@ ate over a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Milli@@ on@@ är@@ s @-@ Series &apos;
some of the we@@ alth@@ i@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back again with some resol@@ ute travellers to have negoti@@ ated by the church dedicated to a field before their mist@@ ress houses .
the travellers have called their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside a prosper@@ ous street of Soli@@ h@@ ull par@@ ked that is called the &quot; Milli@@ on@@ är@@ s Series . &quot;
&quot; they have brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters , after they were released in May , without notice from a given by the Council to prevent their inci@@ dents . &quot;
the t@@ enth group took a gap in the defence of defense and oppressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
angry inhabitants have arous@@ ed the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull who said that it was &quot; us@@ eless be to deal with the problem .
&quot; an anonymous inhabitants said : &quot; they are shipped on the assembly , after they were sent to Bentley he@@ ath where they cast stones to the pas@@ sers . &quot;
the Council must be forced into action by Sch@@ am to implement the problem as he was us@@ eless when dealing with the problem .
the travellers were there in May there were moved and are now back .
&quot; more yesterday evening came to , probably still more . &quot;
&quot; he added : &quot; the Council of Birmingham white , how to deal with it by means long under@@ transfers to protect their parks . &quot;
&quot; I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue my community , if the Council can not stop once . &quot;
&quot; a coun@@ sell@@ or who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; it is ri@@ dic@@ ulous , we have just seen the last round of these travellers , only to pl@@ unge from another round . &quot;
&quot; this time , the numbers have increased this time and you even have seen a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; a speaker of the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said , &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorized camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and working with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; in order to support our suppor@@ ters , it is very important that as many coun@@ ten@@ ants announce a anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by giving 101 . &quot;
&quot; this contributes to making a picture of the situation in which the Court must prove , when we present our case . &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house before the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts is currently being renovated and will be opened on the 1st of March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; for the closing of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the ambi@@ ance of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof , by the ambi@@ ance of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof , held around 30 000 nights per year and also revenue by the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in the fall of 2014 , in view of the dramatic figures of refugees who arrived in the Land@@ scape , the hotel building offered as a collective accommodation , which was available for contro@@ vers@@ y discussions . &quot;
the town prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a building plan to secure the territory as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ contro@@ versi@@ al at that time in the council .
&quot; but above all the Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts Ober@@ bourgeois Julian O@@ ss@@ wald has been def@@ ended the hotel location , and spoke at that time from serious interest in the house . &quot;
he should be right .
&quot; the Group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with business leader Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer , with seat in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ers , the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof has acquired a voluntary contribution in Berlin and will be back to a house of the three @-@ star @-@ Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object four houses .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Her@@ renal@@ b .
&quot; featuring hot Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ is@@ en@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the previous Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof have been standing in front of the entrance to the entrance , and when you move the house , becomes plain , cat@@ ch extensive renov@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; the so@@ ils have been converted , blan@@ kets as part is built , ancient bath@@ tubs from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
until March there is still much to do .
&quot; it is actually a lovely place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the Black &apos;s style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is converted , there will be new windows . &quot;
&quot; everything sol@@ le later &quot; beautiful &quot; nah , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer express . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment . &quot;
&quot; one wants to position not positioned at the high level of the hotel in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a cu@@ red city @-@ level , emphas@@ izes Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to set wide , explains the de@@ er further . &quot;
both individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
conversations with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Touris@@ m@@ ber Michael Kr@@ ause he already led so she@@ er .
the performances of the city be re@@ covered with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; after the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer wants not to define . &quot;
&quot; just under a million euros , he calcul@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; even the external systems are brought on for@@ mann , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard comes a large terrace , which is publicly available from the restaurant which is publicly available . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ air@@ medi@@ ator sets the Grand Jury a
in the Russia aff@@ air to U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp is intended to have special investig@@ ators Robert Mu@@ eller after a report a so @-@ called Grand jury .
&quot; the Panel took the work in recent weeks , the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; wrote to calling with the matter of familiar persons . &quot;
&quot; the newspaper valuable the step as a sign , that Mu@@ eller has extended its encour@@ agement and intensi@@ fied . &quot;
the sender of CN@@ N told the first pre@@ lad@@ ations of the Gre@@ mi@@ um in connection with a meeting between Tru@@ mp@@ s and Russian son .
us intelligence services acc@@ used the Kre@@ m@@ lin for a long@@ standing in the presidential elections in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller expl@@ ores if there were ab@@ sent between Tru@@ mp@@ s of elect@@ oral team and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of expl@@ oration , several men are standing in the elect@@ oral competition as a consultant of repub@@ lic@@ anism . &quot;
&quot; it was saying , Mu@@ eller also took more and more tru@@ mp@@ s private and business environment under the micros@@ cope . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special medi@@ ator Tru@@ mp was personally responsible in the centre and under@@ carriage , whether the president is disabled in the course of the aff@@ air . &quot;
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to prove to consider this evidence of possible ex@@ cl@@ ause waste and decide whether indic@@ t@@ ment shall be collected .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called acc@@ used chambers .
mostly they will be swit@@ ched if there are bigger and contro@@ vers@@ y cases .
the procedure is always behind closed doors .
&quot; the Panel can also be swit@@ ched by the prosec@@ ut@@ or , in order to proceed to individuals under E@@ id . &quot;
&quot; according to the Sender of CN@@ N , the meeting between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ R. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
people who were involved in the meeting were asked to be asked to a statement that was called in the report .
&quot; moreover , they should provide documents . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Tru@@ mp J@@ R. , Tru@@ mp@@ s consultants and son @-@ in @-@ law Jar@@ ed Kus@@ hn@@ er , as well as his previous elect@@ oral Paul Man@@ a@@ fort he did in conversation . &quot;
&quot; legal experts said on Thursday evening in the U.S. television , that the recovery show that Mu@@ eller in his work do not restri@@ ct and that he should be necessary , quickly negoti@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand jury will be swit@@ ched on the end to decide on the survey of a charges . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the observ@@ ance of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums was the beginning of a new phase in investigations and a new reason to concern president Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the new revel@@ ations , the President on Thursday evening took a speech in West Virginia to represent the Russia aff@@ air as a campaign of his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the Russia @-@ story is a total in@@ vention , &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; the topic give the democr@@ ats a way to feel good , because they have nothing else about they can talk about . &quot;
&quot; his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in an opinion , he know nothing of the replacement of a Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; however , they usually work in the secret , stressed . &quot;
the White House supports any measures that acceler@@ ated the work of the special agent on &quot; fair &quot; way .
the former F@@ BI leader James Com@@ ey promised three times that no against the President will be determined .
&quot; one have no reason to accept that something , it was in the explanation further . &quot;
Mu@@ eller was only used after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey had fallen .
because of this r@@ ash were pre @-@ har@@ p against Tru@@ mp . he had to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary .
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June before a senior committee , Tru@@ mp gave it to an attitude of the investigation against the then national security consultant Michael Fl@@ ynn . &quot;
the president is under great pressure because of the examination .
according to the presentation of US media the wh@@ ites house material against the special medi@@ ator and its employees .
the rede@@ emed spec@@ ulation about whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller are w@@ ond@@ ed .
&quot; unlike an independent special medi@@ ator of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate Aff@@ air@@ es around the later President Richard Ni@@ x@@ on , Mu@@ eller has led a position in which he theore@@ tically fallen out of the President of the judi@@ cial ministry . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to bend such a single step .
&quot; two groups of Repub@@ li@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators stood on Thursday Leg@@ isl@@ ation held on Thursday , after which the special medi@@ ator could no longer be released . &quot;
Antarc@@ tic : gigan@@ tic Eis@@ berg drives in Antarc@@ tica
&quot; in the West@@ ant@@ ark@@ tis , a gigan@@ tic Eis@@ berg is solved by the just thirty @-@ seven size of Berlin@@ s . &quot;
he divided the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener Institute of Polar@@ - and seafood on Wednesday with .
&quot; the over a Bil@@ lion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers big Kol@@ oss t@@ oss is now coming to the north , and will probably have two , three years until he was mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; it is located with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the largest ice performances , the researchers have registered in the past three decades . &quot;
there is no danger to people from him .
&quot; however , climate change has played a role in the break@@ through of the ic@@ eberg , is un@@ clear after researchers . &quot;
&quot; in total , however , there has been a series of un@@ common cor@@ rup@@ tions of ice @-@ aces in the region , writes the U.S. research centre for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a factor . &quot;
&quot; according to the opinion of many researchers , this can hang up with the heating heating . &quot;
the now b@@ aked Kol@@ oss was so far a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ celeb@@ rates .
Sch@@ el@@ bow swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by big gl@@ acier .
it continues to grow further on the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C archipelago is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarc@@ tic peninsula .
the north of this hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e was the balance of wax@@ ing and ab@@ om@@ iting a few years ago .
a complete shot was sm@@ ashed there , writes A@@ WI @-@ resear@@ cher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; there is some things that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ lion is in danger , because the previous ed@@ ges have never been with@@ drawn as far as at present . &quot;
&quot; also stand out the ice @-@ plate under tension and could be broken , if at a key place a piece ab@@ bre@@ eze . &quot;
the mel@@ ting of Sch@@ el@@ celeb@@ s and Eis@@ berg raised the sea level since they flo@@ ur@@ ged on the water and ice cream as much water as it y@@ ields after the mel@@ ting itself .
&quot; however , the loss of shame on that the gl@@ acier goes directly to the sea and can flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the sea level , however only in the light of the extent , writes the British research project to observe the Antarc@@ tic ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ celeb@@ rates is after A@@ WI @-@ statements with almost 50 000 square kilometres , the fourth quarter of the Antarc@@ tic . &quot;
&quot; on the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front @-@ edge to the free ocean around 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks down regularly .
&quot; although there is a natural skill and no direct connection to climate change is aware of the ice @-@ plate now comes into a endanger@@ ed position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ Le@@ ary from the British Sw@@ an@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the extensive withdrawal since the beginning of the records , he confirmed . &quot;
&quot; among scientists be contro@@ versi@@ al whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ bow will now grow again or going back in the long run , and possibly summar@@ ize , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
&quot; even if this resear@@ cher will not lead the break of this gigan@@ tic ov@@ ber@@ gs , so in recent decades , there are many ice @-@ pac@@ ed of the Antarc@@ tic peninsula . &quot;
this long p@@ ples of Antarc@@ tic extends towards South America .
&quot; after data , British Antarc@@ tic Surv@@ ey is the ice @-@ area of the Antarc@@ tic peninsula since the 19@@ 50s to 28 000 square kilometers . &quot;
to the decline of the temperature increased .
&quot; the Antarc@@ tic peninsula have gone up around three degrees at the past 50 years , and thus tough to the areas where the temperature is the fast@@ est . &quot;
CD@@ U wants to be Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
&quot; because it is becoming increasingly difficult to occup@@ y freely common places , the CD@@ U is calling for more attractive to be more attractive . &quot;
only shortly before the summer@@ time the circle was 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1100 pages and officials working for the county administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now even 17 tra@@ inees of their first working day after themselves .
the teachers in the circle are obviously very popular .
roughly 620 applications for those in this year are expected to see places .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle continues to be able to cope with the growing requirements and tasks . &quot;
currently there are at the circle of M@@ ett@@ mann still in front of 50 non @-@ net@@ worked positions .
&quot; among other things , doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration . &quot;
the CD@@ U would like to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ D initiative and ent@@ angl@@ ed the tra@@ verse in the administration .
administration is intended to work out a concept of personnel and human resources according to the desire of the parties . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to cover not only short @-@ term im@@ fe to specialists , but future @-@ oriented towards candidates , means it means . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should be based on both inside and outside , concrete measures for cross @-@ cli@@ m@@ bers and include an educational offen@@ sive , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ shared . &quot;
it sounds already after a good approach .
for the circle has to do with a personal problems that you do not know before .
other towns adver@@ tise good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions .
&quot; the speech is given by a regular &quot; &quot; competition of public employers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition , a high number of employees comes from health or alter@@ ation caused by the service . &quot;
&quot; thus , the highest time for action is so that no longer places remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond his party to the common motion . &quot;
&quot; he was made un@@ long ago in the circle day for a fold surprise , when he set the pay@@ roll of public in question and the other parties dec@@ lined . &quot;
people would like to be veri@@ fied that all the possibilities to be veri@@ fied from the municipal employers .
&quot; if we are not coming soon to a satisfac@@ tory solution , the county @-@ administration with the unions - maybe even in cooperation with the county @-@ nation@@ als - an Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ al controll@@ able , &quot; so peoples . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the CD@@ U , the CD@@ U , the employees and officials want to pay better , when it actually looks the Tari@@ ff for the public service . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently exactly pre @-@ written , enh@@ anc@@ ements or more money there is only when you move into a higher level which is oriented towards occupational years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle has grown steadily over the past few years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be established in which to take care of the provisions of the new constitutional law . &quot;
&quot; not least by the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , land@@ rat Thomas H@@ end@@ ele and Kreis@@ tor@@ ture@@ Martin Richter is a problem : they have too little staff . &quot;
Italy shar@@ pen@@ ing the tone to NGO @-@ migrants @-@ lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; Italy has NGOs to use the lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , war@@ ned that they may not continue to keep up new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs have no new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can work on , &quot; said Internal Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Tur@@ iner daily La Stamp@@ a . &quot;
&quot; Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day , after the Italian authorities had a boat made by the German aid &apos; youth R@@ ingo &apos; sei@@ zed because their team worked effectively with traffic@@ ers in a way that facilit@@ ated the illegal immigration . &quot;
&quot; the aid organisation , which has only been in operation since a year , it is starting to express themselves a detailed cau@@ tions of the Italian state swal@@ low Amb@@ ro@@ gio Cart@@ osi@@ o . &quot;
&quot; for us , the rescue of human life is our top priority . so we are sorry to operate at the moment in the search and rescue zone , &quot; the organization said in an opinion on social media . &quot;
&quot; we can all ap@@ ologies that are currently collected , only after we have collected all the information and judge the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had the boat from &apos; youth R@@ ight@@ &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , which has been monitored since October . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that his crew ten@@ er migrants will take on board that they can be delivered directly from Men@@ she@@ ers , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can be used again , so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least such a coinci@@ dence , suppos@@ edly found only 1,3 miles before the Liby@@ an coast , according to the acc@@ ord of the prosec@@ ut@@ or , whose content of Italian media has been published . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is susp@@ ects themselves on authority of the Italian coastal guard , the lif@@ egu@@ ests in the zone of humanitarian reasons , and not of any other moti@@ fs . &quot;
under the Code of Conduc@@ t boats must have boats like I@@ u@@ vent@@ a above all an Italian police officers on board that monitors their activities .
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and lif@@ ebo@@ ards , have previously prepared to keep yourself in the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday , that the new rules would be un@@ necessary , but acceptable as they would not bring &quot; essential modifications or disabilities &quot; of their lif@@ ebo@@ ards . &quot;
among those who refuse to sign is the No@@ bel lau@@ re@@ ates @-@ organization doctors without borders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; Minn@@ es@@ iti now said that the number of migrants had come back to rescue operations in Italy , in recent weeks , what the efforts to strengthen the Liby@@ an territ@@ orial coast and the cooperation with the local citizens of the fruits have borne fruit . &quot;
&quot; in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; he gave plans for further talks with Liby@@ an citizens in this month about economic development initiatives and with ch@@ ad , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who can reach these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot;

&quot; nine W@@ eil@@ er@@ mer bi@@ ker , the &quot; Berliner outer po@@ sten &quot; &quot; and two guest @-@ riders met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the North @-@ alz to enjoy four days long and places of interest . &quot;
&quot; in this , three friendly guides were available . &quot;
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led to hot summer temperatures along the vineyard to the Michael@@ sk@@ ap@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; there followed view@@ points , partly on door@@ men , of which you could look far over the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest and the pre@@ mier@@ ed levels . &quot;
&quot; in between there , there were over again for long periods , for the long run . &quot;
on the second day he went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and the People &apos;s Festival .

console instead of grass - Bundes@@ liga retro@@ fit for e @-@ sport
sit all the sport @-@ stars in the future of computer consu@@ me instead of struggling with wind and weather over the stadium of a stadium ?
fact : e @-@ Sport has long been a serious business to become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions fans and huge tournaments with high gas@@ es included . &quot;
&quot; this also recognized the first federal states , which increasingly engage in this field . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of 2015 the V@@ f@@ l Wol@@ fs@@ burg , later followed the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , the middle of July an E @-@ Sport department was founded and two professionals for the Computer Games FIFA 17 under contract . &quot;
&quot; we hope to insp@@ ire very new young audi@@ ences for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says the Board of Jochen Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
he is sure that on this train still lie down .
&quot; in the coming weekend the football @-@ World association FIFA in London is organized the first &quot; interactive Club World Cup , &quot; in which the gam@@ er of different clubs are confront@@ ed with each other . &quot;
&quot; besides nuts and Wol@@ fs@@ burg have qualified for example Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven . &quot;
Robin Dut@@ t looks great potential in the E @-@ Sport .
the Ex @-@ coach of Bayer L@@ ever@@ k@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; the real football needs to deal with the 14 to 30 years old , the young people even go to the stadium , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year old . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs sought to conqu@@ er all kinds of markets , especially the Asian , to conqu@@ er . &quot;
&quot; with prominent e @-@ sport , one could be far more far more frequently on these markets than once a year to send the federal government to Asia than once a year . &quot;
what is it exactly ?
&quot; at e @-@ Sport will play computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Counter@@ strike &quot; or just down the football @-@ Simulation FIFA on competition level . &quot;
&quot; long ago , as in normal sport also , le@@ agues are established in which the pro@@ s are confront@@ ed with each other . &quot;
and to the Asi@@ en@@ play 2022 E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program .
but is it all about a proper sport ?
for many is the performance to be used for sure .
also Ingo F@@ rob@@ ous has long been diver@@ ting with the question .
&quot; for the professor at the German Spor@@ tho@@ ch@@ schule in Cologne , e @-@ Sport is a sports , because he is un@@ peti@@ tion and many organic and physical reactions , which one can also find in classical sports - for example increased cardi@@ ences , stress reaction , hormon@@ al changes . &quot;
furthermore there is cogni@@ tive skills to a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a quick reaction .
&quot; professional gam@@ er should not only be part of the console , but also train their body and look at the diet . &quot;
&quot; the f@@ ancy player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sorry , but also problems : &quot; &quot; d@@ oping is becoming more and more a topic . &quot;
controls are difficult to per@@ t@@ able in online games and in the scene missing the structures of the classic sport .
the scientists emphas@@ izes the high Integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ Sports .
&quot; the players are internationally on the go , that is like a great global family , there is no intercultural shirts . &quot;
a study of corporate guidance Del@@ o@@ itte and the federal association Inter@@ active entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) says the E @-@ Sport an rapid growth .
&quot; in 2016 , in Germany , 50 million euros have been implemented , mainly about advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments . &quot;
sales revenue grew by 130 million in three years .
against the barely 2.@@ 4 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga is the very little .
&quot; however , be the e @-@ sport &quot; &quot; not far from the other established sports as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice cream , &quot; write Del@@ o@@ itte advis@@ or . &quot;
international are many countries so far .
large markets are Asia and the US where ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US Team nr@@ g e@@ Sports .
Hollywood @-@ actors Asht@@ on K@@ ut@@ cher invested in the e@@ Sport @-@ Competition Uni@@ kr@@ n .
also in Europe is doing a lot .
&quot; in an Norwegian school , e @-@ Sport has been introduced as a schol@@ ar , says F@@ rob@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and in France , the Bundes@@ liga @-@ associations according to Dut@@ t has been obliged to set up an e @-@ sports department . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison Germany back@@ ward , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ Board Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; only in no@@ stal@@ gia to fall , and the old times clari@@ fy today is no longer sufficient . &quot;
&quot; this is why the tradition of the association is to preserve , but the company is at the same time in the modern market . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digi@@ tis@@ ed world , so also Dut@@ t . &quot;
&quot; because one cannot consoli@@ date , that only at football everything remains as it was always . &quot;

&quot; Michelle Carter because of the texts , the Conrad Ro@@ y for self @-@ ch@@ ord , condem@@ ned &quot;
a woman from Mass@@ ach@@ us@@ etts were sentenced to two to two years because they encouraged their friend through texts and calls for self .
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their condem@@ nation behind bars and five years were susp@@ ended . &quot;
Carter was condem@@ ned in June due to the per@@ me@@ able pot@@ ism by Conrad Ro@@ y who took life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Ro@@ y said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is ir@@ reversible .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until the vocation .
she had been confront@@ ed with a maximum penalty of 20 years but their legal coun@@ table ar@@ gu@@ ed that both she and Mr Ro@@ y on a psych@@ ic disease .
&quot; in red h@@ osen and a cream coloured bl@@ ouse , Carter da with t@@ ears in the eyes , with ti@@ led hands and down in down eyes , when they were sentenced . &quot;
&quot; their actions took Conrad Ro@@ y , &quot; said the prosec@@ ut@@ ess of the judgment . &quot;
they ended his life to make their own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility over , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it has no re@@ vocation . &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ ters also said , it was a &quot; terrible circum@@ stance , which they are totally regre@@ t@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , he did not find out that their &quot; age or maturity or even their spiritual disease can have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a prosec@@ ut@@ or a statement by Ro@@ ys Mother Lyn@@ n Ro@@ y , who bes@@ ieg@@ ed that there is no day where I am not the loss of my beloved Son . &quot;
&quot; I want it to be proud of me and how I go with everything . I try , despite all my p@@ ains that we will carry for etern@@ ity with us , for his sisters , it means it . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Ro@@ y , said that she will never be prosec@@ uted by the knowledge , &quot; I will never take part in the wedding of her brother , or be a a@@ unt for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer have this single person with which I was together for my birth every day , is a pain , which I will always keep for the rest of my life . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to put a legal precision fall , since there is no law in Mass@@ ach@@ us@@ etts , which makes it a crime to commit to others . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Ro@@ y in 2014 was dead by a carbon oxid@@ ation in a vehicle .
&quot; the case attracted national attention to themselves , after Car@@ ters short@@ cut , un@@ v@@ eil@@ ed that she had encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; Hän@@ g you on , spring of a building , create yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many paths , she said in several messages that she was in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the eye in front of his self @-@ ch@@ ord she wrote : &quot; you have to do it , Conrad &quot; and &quot; All that you must do is to turn to the generator , and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter visited by the death of Ro@@ y and ord@@ ained that they will benefit from any media from the case .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
&quot; to the few , the Carter def@@ ended , was condem@@ ned Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , which was condem@@ ned in the 2007 because of the murder of her British room@@ mate in Italy before she was released two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help , not j@@ ail . &quot;

&quot; what was different from his place in the cabin , that saw Joshua Kim@@ me immediately , even if the extra gar@@ ment was very small , very small . &quot;
&quot; but since far and wide on the second day of Audi C@@ ups of course no Philipp l@@ ah@@ m , and also not a Manuel Neu@@ er , he made himself shared with him . &quot;
&quot; the Trainer has not announced it , told the Con@@ ferenc@@ ing Cup winner back , after his first use as Bavaria captain . &quot;
&quot; well , the income could have been better run than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples . &quot;

&quot; and at all , Kim@@ my belong@@ ed to this start @-@ formation like the one who can also take the best into your hand . &quot;
he gave instructions to guide the un@@ married tro@@ upe .
&quot; he had a look for the whole , while many others were busy themselves . &quot;
&quot; Vi@@ dal thus , to over@@ play its lack of fitness ( fol@@ ds hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches to establish the services of Asia @-@ trip ( fol@@ d@@ anced only ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le therefore not fall into their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ k@@ ot . &quot;

business satisfied with the land @-@ pf@@ ael@@ ic minister : economy lo@@ bt Tempo
&quot; the relationship was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the land and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) nor economics of Rhineland @-@ Palatinate . &quot;
&quot; this is evident after more than one year , in which the new economic Minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office . &quot;
&quot; Cham@@ bers , and companies from the region refer to T V @-@ request of a change in economic policy - and hon@@ ey@@ ed at the same time the old Minist@@ ries . &quot;
&quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Enterprises ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing g@@ aged the wishes of the economy , the Lem@@ ke all@@ es@@ amt block@@ ed . &quot;

&quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays the west @-@ line tri@@ er , which stands in an urgent need for the federal level plan . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to take the route in December 2020 , says Minist@@ eri@@ ality Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ us sees it a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competitive enterprises . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Industry and Chamber of Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Tri@@ er seeks to increase sales in supermarkets , in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports for ten years . &quot;
&quot; moreover , Wis@@ sing is an open ear for people who want to create a company who want to create the I@@ HK . &quot;
&quot; the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Tri@@ er sees an additional incen@@ tive for young tra@@ inees , says CEO Matthias Schwal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; provided is an award from 1000 Euro for the best master@@ ing and 2500 Euro , when graduates within ten years after the master@@ pieces are self @-@ employed . &quot;
the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; in the planned road construction are quick facts to create , at the same time it is the country on the necessary staff , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , captain of the I@@ HK Tri@@ er . &quot;
&quot; 56 new engineers , who wants to adjust the Wis@@ dom at the provin@@ cial mobility , are so far occupied 29 places so far . &quot;

Audi aims to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - Auto@@ producer faces to be confront@@ ed with a counter@@ reaction
&quot; one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW chairman said , the company is the opinion that there are intelligent options as a constra@@ int , and related to European cities - including Munich , where BMW ans@@ ug@@ ly is to ban or restri@@ ct . &quot;
&quot; Daim@@ ler gave on Tuesday , that there will be three million Mercedes @-@ vehicles in Europe to reduce his diesel emissions . &quot;
none of the companies describe the entrepreneurs as a call .
European automotive manufacturers have strongly supported the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; but the nit@@ rogen ox@@ ides , the diesel engines , are considered as kar@@ zin@@ ogen@@ ic and can cause as@@ thma . &quot;
&quot; the costs for the automotive manufacturer , systems for neutr@@ alization of diesel vehicles to install pull out gas@@ es , also take what it makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also indic@@ ted to rel@@ ieve the powerful auto@@ fir@@ men and ignore the signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies try to avoid the errors of Volkswagen to avoid using so @-@ above @-@ down devices , the emissions could be regul@@ ate if a car was tested , but when a car was tested , but in normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States several candidates were indic@@ ted by Volkswagen , others will be investig@@ ated on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; last month , the former manager of the Ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics was arrested in the motor development of Audi in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be placed in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year Audi has been included in German criminal investigation into Volkswagen , after the authorities to have a system to handle the em@@ ission rules in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi into the investigation might be easy to load : the luxury car manufacturer carries transm@@ proportional to the gain of Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ es and the laughter against the suffering
mor@@ di@@ llo was tempor@@ al one of the most sophisticated cart@@ oon @-@ artist , the Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ ases of his figures are his trademark . &quot;
also with 85 the Argent@@ inian tradition is still working and works on a film .
&quot; his message : laughter , &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Gu@@ ill@@ i Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as son Spanish immig@@ rants in Buenos Aires .
in the first few years as an artist found himself among other things as a beg@@ inner for bl@@ ink cards by - what it was fru@@ str@@ ated .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost in my job , he said once . &quot;
&quot; after stops in Lima , New York and Paris at the end of the 60@@ s of the break@@ through : with the publication of his Cart@@ o@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; &quot; and then also in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
getting more and over again the artists of cities insp@@ ire .
&quot; large , rund@@ own Mor@@ di@@ llo figures batt@@ les in drawings with the black@@ smith Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , he has its own information on the drawing up today , works on a day of almost ten hours . &quot;
&quot; over calendar , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ Shirts , Pl@@ ush animals and watches find his dro@@ ll figures still much spread worldwide . &quot;
he has also been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with his figures .
&quot; the main person in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los animals in his drawings - who has an exchange rate as an counter@@ player . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie which should come to the movie screen . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it is strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; therefore , he is rather focused on the TV series , which is made as its original records , liter@@ ary . &quot;
lav@@ ender from Provence is threatened with climate change
&quot; he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened with climate change . &quot;
&quot; the Lav@@ ender is re@@ minded of the conditions and because of the disease @-@ borne insects , what scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , great head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agr@@ arian institutions CR@@ I@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the Lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively threat@@ ening because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change , who has brought much less rain in spring and fall much more . &quot;
this has effects on the life span of lav@@ ender .
&quot; there is also a small z@@ ik@@ ade , a Mik@@ rob@@ ber , the d@@ g@@ zi@@ k@@ ades , and with very dry weather there are many of it . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
lav@@ ender oil temp@@ t not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers but it is also demand for perf@@ umes and cosmetics .
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of very long plant life with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , AC@@ TW@@ IC@@ K@@ EL@@ TE and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
so we have less parts with eth@@ eric oil . &quot;
&quot; among the solutions that are considered to be considered , a better water distribution and slow@@ ing of the ev@@ acu@@ ation of the soil , but also the b@@ illing of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of sorts , which are resistant to dry@@ ness . &quot;

the ass@@ ass@@ ination of a journ@@ alist emphas@@ ises the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the weekly Rio@@ do@@ ce normally meet that their plans for reporting about the youn@@ gest chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , cor@@ rupt officials and un@@ disp@@ uted drugs . &quot;
&quot; but on this day , in the shadow of her own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
it was communic@@ ated to them that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ level journalists will discuss what is safer to feel secure : you should take your children with your office , the 2009 goal of an attack with gran@@ ulates , or they leave at home . &quot;
&quot; safety experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ alized , alli@@ ances . &quot;
&quot; you ask the Re@@ porter , names for each column - no proof is necessary , per@@ cep@@ tions and pan@@ try . &quot;
&quot; there are drugs inf@@ ants , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are sus@@ pic@@ ious to stand on the sal@@ ary of the government or the map , a catalogue of Crime , which can be dangerous to the chaos of Mexico . &quot;
&quot; there is no rest from violence , and throughout the land the cor@@ p@@ ses , are becoming more journalists at least 25 , since President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Ni@@ eto shall be held in December 2012 and has been under at least seven pl@@ ote in seven states . &quot;
&quot; among the latter is its publisher and her inspir@@ ator of Rio@@ do@@ ce , the co @-@ founder of Javier Val@@ de@@ z Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and journ@@ alist , &quot; wrote Val@@ de@@ z in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot;
&quot; his lack will be deeply felt , although its presence is present everywhere - a great photo of Val@@ de@@ z , which shows his mid@@ finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; , &quot; on the fa@@ ç@@ ade of the Rio@@ do@@ ce building . two Re@@ porter in the three @-@ thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Miriam Ram@@ i@@ rez , bear T @-@ shirts that his smiling face with spectac@@ les or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss about their shared topics , the trau@@ ma , their Alp@@ dreams , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although 2010 a special @-@ government office was established in order to process the cases of journalists , this according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists is conducted only two criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; as with most of the evenings of Mor@@ den , which are linked each year with drug and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely placed before dish . &quot;
&quot; near Rio@@ do@@ ce they still consist of treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are un@@ bear@@ able and even though the terrain is still more se@@ perate . &quot;
&quot; without information on the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meetings for the discussion of the safety of little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very stup@@ id to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we do not know the Why , mis@@ str@@ ate we all . &quot;
in the morning of 15 May Val@@ de@@ z left the office of the newspaper Rio@@ do@@ ce in the provin@@ cial capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; he made it just to ride a few blocks away before his red Toyota CO@@ RO@@ L@@ LA was raised by two men . he was forced from his car , probably due to the name of the newspaper - who is translated with &quot; twelve &quot; &quot; river &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the cry came into his car away and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ de@@ z was 50 years old .
he made a woman and two adults children .
od@@ ours tend to move freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; but on the subject of Val@@ de@@ z , there is practically nothing but silence . &quot;
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ mans ar@@ rests last year and the delivery in the United States in January was Sin@@ alo@@ a to one of the blo@@ o@@ dies@@ t powers of the country , as riv@@ alis@@ ing political groups fight here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; there is nothing that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone can be shot or more people on the road or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ stor@@ ey m@@ ons for drugs , which are larger than many houses for the living . &quot;
&quot; forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranquility &quot; , &quot; if only a Kart@@ ell will have control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ de@@ z was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Rio@@ do@@ ce , with the gu@@ ilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first of all , it was published in February the publication of a interview with Dam@@ as@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the mut@@ ually cartridges compil@@ ations in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans S@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have the sons of shar@@ pen@@ ed , susp@@ ected gang@@ sters purchased each copy of the output when she was delivered to Tim@@ et@@ ki@@ os@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; the second fault was unable to force Val@@ de@@ z , after the con@@ fis@@ cation of another paper , which had published the same story to leave the country to its own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ de@@ z was a leg@@ end in Mexico and abroad , and its pot@@ ism is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had so long survi@@ ved that his friends and colleagues were as@@ sump@@ tions that he would still be there .
&quot; he was active in 2003 as an experienced repor@@ ters for Nor@@ the@@ este as he joined together with five colleagues on the establishment of Rio@@ do@@ ce , and 50 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without st@@ ating on the ro@@ d@@ ow@@ ry problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; with the time the newspaper served a reputation because of the cour@@ age@@ ous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising took place . &quot;
&quot; Re@@ porter has been able to publish hard co@@ operating investigations without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and the reader were cap@@ tiv@@ ated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else . &quot;
eight years after the establishment of Rio@@ do@@ ce she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for their reporting in Latin America .
&quot; in the same year Val@@ de@@ z won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in the persecution of the Mexican drug history , where always she crossed . &quot;
he gave himself up volunt@@ arily that he had fear .
&quot; I want to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award . &quot;
&quot; drug trading in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life &quot; &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot;
you must take the task that falls you as a journ@@ alist or either you play the dum@@ pl@@ ers .
&quot; I want not to be asked : &quot; &quot; what have you done so many tot@@ he ... why did you not told what went before ? &quot;
&quot; the Rio@@ do@@ ce team miss Val@@ de@@ z , the Spa@@ eth who was like a harbor workers , the friend , the generous with h@@ ugs and advice , a teacher , the knew how one survi@@ ved . &quot;
you trust his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Guay@@ abo , the bar towards the office , go and sit down there at the same table . &quot;
now ask them : was his love for routine be his embarrass@@ ment ?
&quot; his death also has to forced them to ask their own as@@ sump@@ tions about how they work best and stay alive . &quot;
&quot; they do not like it with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their native rows and land@@ ways to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high level of autonomy and self @-@ conservation . &quot;
his own inst@@ inc@@ ts trust .
&quot; if it fails , lead to it away . &quot;
&quot; the hass@@ le is , &quot; said the editor of the Rio@@ do@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real that &quot; sm@@ ell is a sense that can be get@@ ed ... and then is the thing with Javier has happened . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , apply in Sin@@ alo@@ a no longer - just as in Tam@@ li@@ li@@ pas , VER@@ AC@@ RU@@ Z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a tox@@ ic mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gel@@ routes , weak institutions and cor@@ rupt government offices . &quot;
the landscape is constantly changing .
&quot; in the room , in which the staff of Rio@@ do@@ ce has been allowed , suddenly there were no hand@@ ys . days previously announced that spy@@ ware became sold exclusively by governments , used for monitoring journalists and acti@@ vi@@ sts in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; outside of two polic@@ emen , protection against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree . &quot;
&quot; they were commissioned by the provin@@ cial government , the offices of Rio@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a central area of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; half of the Scher@@ z , some of the repor@@ ters who belong to the 50 percent of the police officers , who belong to the govern@@ or itself as not trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months ago , since the repor@@ ters have gone into the bur@@ ns where the drug heads are fac@@ to under control . &quot;
for the edition of this week Rio@@ do@@ ce has a three main stories .
there was the ass@@ ass@@ ination of the former known box@@ ers Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ ve@@ z in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
&quot; they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the citi@@ zenship , which focused on the hom@@ et@@ own of the govern@@ or of the government . &quot;
&quot; and there was a group that led in one of the most beautiful restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , one block from the office of the state of prosec@@ ut@@ or , led to an ab@@ duction . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who kid@@ n@@ apped , or how it happened , so was caution when it was time to write , what each in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite area of drug tra@@ ders and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a repor@@ ters made of public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian , who heard the Reg@@ ul@@ ing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( Pr@@ i ) , which is nearly all political levels . &quot;
recently several Pr@@ i govern@@ or were acc@@ used because of high @-@ quality cases of corruption .
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real bat the Re@@ porter , about previous inci@@ dents in this locality , including one , in which a son of &quot; El Ch@@ apo &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man went to a military survival . &quot;
&quot; for a few months before , the reader would have taken the Kolum@@ ne of Val@@ de@@ z as the best informative source of de@@ duction . &quot;
&quot; previously we had already knew what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; because of his sl@@ ender body . &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; the office of Val@@ de@@ z was devoted to storage space for characters and stick@@ ers that are devoted to the Mor@@ de of journalists , because the employees have become something they had never expected : acti@@ vi@@ sts in the name of the press . &quot;
&quot; Re@@ por@@ e Miriam Ram@@ i@@ rez was a couple of signs and went next morning to a demonstration because of another journ@@ alist to the office of the prosec@@ ut@@ or &apos;s office . &quot;
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared and three days after Val@@ de@@ z was killed , in the Western federal state Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
a burned body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is . &quot;
&quot; throughout the country , journalists have become a state of journalists by being written in organised protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; &quot; on walking and constructions . &quot;
&quot; on this day the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone to Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Val@@ de@@ z . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with the govern@@ or of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the mur@@ ders of Val@@ de@@ z pre@@ aching Ram@@ i@@ rez the authorities , journalists , and let them bring them , because they said the truth . &quot;
&quot; she has asked us for ever , that she is again informed by the government , because it is concerned that their anger wo@@ und@@ ed their obj@@ ectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ de@@ z had repeatedly called for journalists in Mexico by organised crime , in this part of government offices and a indiffer@@ ent society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in his final book &quot; &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism &quot; &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters are not only killed by drugs , but also on the command of politicians and security forces , which marks the organised crime under a ceiling . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Artic@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; Artic@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; has achieved more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials in the past year . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico dies there , because they want you to eat the mouth , said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the Mor@@ de have a ab@@ ri@@ pe effect . &quot;
nobody forget the death of the blog@@ ger@@ in Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border of Tam@@ li@@ li@@ pas six years ago .
&quot; your body was found along with a note that was suppos@@ edly signed by Z@@ et@@ as @-@ Kart@@ ell , &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer @-@ shell and ear@@ phones lay next to their separate head .
some stores are elected as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in northern border State Ch@@ ihu@@ ah@@ ua after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dents Mi@@ ro@@ sl@@ ava B@@ reach in March .
&quot; others will continue , as it did El Man@@ ana from Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo according to the ass@@ ass@@ ination of its director in 2004 . &quot;
in 2010 the D@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly directed to the drug board with a editorial title on the front page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ?
some journalists have fled from their home country or even from the country .
it is a pain@@ ful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in ex@@ ile , and they still observe the streets and look for haz@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they will h@@ unted down , as it seems to come with the photographer Ruben Esp@@ in@@ osa , the 2015 combined with four women in an apartment in Mexico City , three months after the escape from VER@@ AC@@ RU@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; for those who stay back and continue , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , the once po@@ et wanted to be , gives that the drug trading is sc@@ ares . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and that is why I was Re@@ porter . &quot;
&quot; around midnight in the last Friday , when the last issue was already ended , the editors of Rio@@ do@@ ce on the civil pass before the office and d@@ rank beer , than at once all their teleph@@ ones began . &quot;
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ers with Band@@ en@@ riv@@ ales and security forces in the vicinity of the seaside ma@@ at@@ lan had 19 confirmed T@@ ote .
the war escal@@ ated as it was promised by a number of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
&quot; from the B@@ ord@@ stein@@ kan@@ te , they have published the news on the website of Rio@@ do@@ ce over mobile phone . &quot;
the front page had to be changed the next day .
sir@@ ens he@@ ul@@ led near to - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez thre@@ w a look at the police officers , the wo@@ ache kept to see if they were in willingness . &quot;
&quot; if they were afraid of fear , they did not seem . &quot;
&quot; under the vast portrait of the coun@@ cils of the paper , whose middle finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , followed the employees of Rio@@ do@@ ce his traces . &quot;
&quot; how can you only think about it , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; when on the same day , the instruc@@ tors was mur@@ dered to send me for reporting on the road . &quot;
din@@ os@@ au@@ r used cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to push its enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue but also a fri@@ ght@@ ening .
&quot; now researchers have found that the first findings of incredible n@@ ash@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian min@@ ers were so well preserved that experts are described as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of Din@@ os@@ au@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; it was so well preserved that they could even notice that his sc@@ ented skin of red@@ ded Braun was - and they said , they could have been some of a &quot; &quot; un@@ peaceful past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the magazine &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; referred to him as &quot; the defe@@ ated Din@@ os@@ au@@ rs , which was ever found , and one of the best din@@ os@@ au@@ rs @-@ copies of the world . &quot;
fos@@ sil is a newly discovered kind of N@@ od@@ os@@ au@@ r that lived in the middle of the circle of circle between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; his incredibly well preserved condition has resear@@ cher , which described it as &quot; really remarkable . &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the best preserved fos@@ sil is the best preserved fos@@ sil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn F@@ unk at the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he met something that seemed to sit down from the surrounding rock , and decided to watch more accurately . &quot;
the Fos@@ sil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ aces .
&quot; they spent the next six years , the wild animal within the 2,@@ 500 pounds ( 1.@@ 100 kg ) of heavy stra@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; after all these hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you only kill a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it was slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientists at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the cre@@ ature is to be seen . &quot;
it is considered to be one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ os@@ au@@ rs @-@ copies - the Mon@@ a Lisa of Din@@ os@@ au@@ rs .
&quot; researchers have found that this plant is covered , although he is covered with a arm@@ ament , and a changing , probably from flesh , send Din@@ os@@ au@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the strong spar@@ ed din@@ os@@ au@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to hide themselves from rob@@ bers , and used a sh@@ iel@@ ding technology , which is used as counter @-@ coating , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have been allowed to mix itself better into its surroundings and serve its enemies , say experts , what it indicates that it has been threatened by larger din@@ os@@ au@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old cre@@ ature from the family of the N@@ od@@ os@@ au@@ rs took place in May for the first time and is now at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ol@@ ers .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and it B@@ ore@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ with@@ ch@@ elli named after the Muse@@ um@@ st@@ echn@@ ics Mark Mitchell , one of a team who has spent more than 7.@@ 000 hours to cover it carefully . &quot;
the aston@@ ishing preservation of the specim@@ ens made it Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of shed and arm@@ ours via his body .
&quot; they discovered the confront@@ ation , a widespread defence method in the animal world , which means that the tip of the cre@@ ature was dar@@ ker than their under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the concent@@ rates are common , the results are surprising , because the size of B@@ ore@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the animals living in animals . &quot;
&quot; it indicates that the din@@ os@@ au@@ rs has enough pressure from flesh , din@@ os@@ au@@ rs was h@@ unted that the evolution was dis@@ astro@@ us as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most of contemporary animals , who stand up by sh@@ aded , zeb@@ ras or g@@ hosts - are much smaller and vulnerable than boot@@ y , which sign@@ alizes that this N@@ od@@ os@@ au@@ rs was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong Rau@@ b@@ tier behavior on a massive , strongly committed din@@ os@@ au@@ rs , how dangerous the din@@ os@@ au@@ rs must have been &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis organize connections in their sc@@ ales also indicates that the skin of the din@@ os@@ au@@ r was red .
&quot; scientists continue to examine the animal on references about his life , including his con@@ fes@@ tive intest@@ ine to find out what it has e@@ aten as its last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ os@@ au@@ r , when he died , into a river gr@@ ills and went out into the sea where he s@@ ank on the back to the sea . &quot;
&quot; at that time Alber@@ ta was so warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably more widespread than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this N@@ od@@ os@@ au@@ rs is really remarkable because he is completely covered with preser@@ v@@ ative skin , but also in three dimensions and ret@@ ains the original form of the animal ret@@ ains , said Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal is almost exactly the same as in the early rolling time .
&quot; you don &apos;t need to use a lot of fantas@@ y to re@@ construct it . if you just have a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that he is on sleeping . &quot;
&quot; the cra@@ yon time was a time , when huge thermal , me@@ eat@@ ers din@@ os@@ au@@ rs , which arose on two legs , the earth had passed . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ nos@@ au@@ rus Rex , millions of years after B@@ ore@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ground@@ ed din@@ os@@ au@@ rs was h@@ unted by some of his fri@@ ght@@ ened ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this belongs to Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ os@@ au@@ rus , a 38 ft foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six ton of severe monsters . &quot;
&quot; the scientists , their latest findings in the journal Current Bi@@ ology will appear to believe that B@@ ore@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was scattered after death in the sea , and in the mud . &quot;
&quot; the cre@@ ature was found by Sha@@ wn F@@ unk at the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum it is the defe@@ ated Din@@ os@@ au@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ ament , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
the creatures were average approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have up to 3.000 pounds ( 1.@@ 300 kg ) .
it included two 20 @-@ inch @-@ long peaks that dominated by its shoul@@ ders .
&quot; the researchers believe that the p@@ anz@@ ated plant ni@@ vor@@ es was p@@ amed by the Western Canada , until a floo@@ ded river towards the open sea . &quot;
but the under@@ water stri@@ ving of the din@@ os@@ au@@ rs of its arm@@ ament in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specim@@ ens are so well preserved that the skin remains still hol@@ y@@ ge ben@@ ches along the din@@ os@@ au@@ rs
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , is such a level of conservation so &apos; rarely like a gain in lot@@ to . &quot;
&quot; the more I see , the more conf@@ use it becomes . &quot;
pet@@ ri@@ fied res@@ te of the skin still cover the hol@@ y@@ ards that carry the sk@@ ull of the animal .
its right @-@ foot lies on his side ; his five fingers are locked up at the top .
I can count the shed on his sole .
in the Thunder@@ storm : Mass@@ enk@@ aram@@ el@@ age on A8 : many verses
fier@@ ce accident on Thurs@@ days on the A8 : nearly 30 cars are processed in a mass @-@ aram@@ el@@ ol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous Ver@@ last , a few kilometres long st@@ aves , and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) have been in@@ ju@@ red in late Thursday morning at a mass @-@ aram@@ el@@ age approximately 20 people .
&quot; after the first details of the police were against 17.00 between the supply of Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Land@@ kreis A@@ ich@@ ah @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a ge@@ wit@@ ters just 30 cars , including also trucks , in@@ compatible . &quot;
the exact number of publishers are initially no data before .
it is about light to moderate bre@@ ach , the police speaker said . &quot;
a big effort to rescue vehicles was at the accident .
the A8 was completely locked in direction Munich .
in the travels of Munich have been formed a approximately ten kilometres long ago .
&quot; like an AZ Re@@ porter , it came to massive disabilities - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
the re@@ vit@@ ality not@@ ated the character of the vehicle gl@@ acier that now have to count with sensitive pen@@ alties .
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 hrs there was still a second accident on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and Das@@ ing . &quot;
it was a coll@@ ision between a sco@@ ot@@ ene and a car .
a bail@@ out gland was on the road to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : Group fro@@ et &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everybody experienced every one : nothing is sitting in the train and sleeps .
or you can deep@@ en in his work and has just a ingen@@ ious thought .
and then : bu@@ f .
comes the Schaff@@ ner and ar@@ ouses an un@@ gentle or travels the driving from the workflow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; cart@@ ag@@ ons &quot; &quot; &quot;
but times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are soon over .
the German rail@@ ways are currently working @-@ free driving .
&quot; it is simply confirmed via mobile phone , that you have taken his place and evalu@@ ates the ticket card . &quot;
currently a test run on two routes .
&quot; comes the offer , we wide it . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to be available for many further distance routes in Germany at the beginning of coming year , &quot; &quot; said a train speaker . &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; the train is called the carrier . &quot;
&quot; to use this , however , you need to be met some requirements : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to booked an online ticket - which already needs to do most passengers .
&quot; it also has to be purchased via the app of the railway , the DB navig@@ ators , which is why the most convenient way of ticket check . &quot;
and finally you need a seating space .
&quot; because the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; does not work in the train , calling his ticket card under &quot; My Tickets &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the test customers will then be a button for electronic de@@ valu@@ ation .
the belonging to their mobile devices will receive a message that Tim@@ g@@ ast X is located on the train and taken the bath@@ ed seat Y .
comes the access to place Y white he knows that there is a passenger that there is a passenger with already ent@@ angl@@ ed online ticket .
&quot; so you can continue to continue , continue . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which again is to use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; who wants to travel relaxed without ticket control through our draw@@ staff , ch@@ atting in the DB navig@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; this allows the guests to make their travel time in the train , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing and Management Board of DB Fern@@ avi@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to the individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; who often travels , knows that next to del@@ ays and pass@@ ages the driving rolls are among the greatest hass@@ les . &quot;
&quot; because often , one has not , in any case , but one of the participants do not send all documents that you need to make an upgra@@ ding of online ticket . &quot;
either l@@ acks the credit card or the Personnel reference or otherwise a document that you have to prove .
&quot; the episode are endless discussions between mig@@ rant and chassis , which leads to bad mood in the storage or large space and del@@ ays in control of your own tickets and takes the creativity at the end the time to take care of other concerns . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that is only on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further traction numbers on the same track are not un@@ locked .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sh@@ aken to its core .
&quot; only one day when she arrived in New York City , sitting in St. Louis born on the bed of an Air@@ cal@@ b apartment that she rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on their phone . &quot;
you st@@ um@@ bled upon a post of someone out of high school .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year child , and there is still on the street , and it was called there . &quot;
&quot; conf@@ used as no one else on their feed had the information posted , closed on Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly saved on their Tim@@ eline .
&quot; the rap@@ per from the territory of St. Louis was involved , the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 year old , which was killed by a white polic@@ emen in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mon . &quot;
he posted a picture of brow@@ ns blocks &apos;s body that was stret@@ ched on the street and stay four hours there .
&quot; this is wild , &quot; covered Fer@@ rell at itself . &quot;
but death was nothing new for her and her community .
she put her cell phone to return later on evening to Twe@@ ets about people at Can@@ field Drive .
&quot; there were photos of the police band and people , cr@@ ying , and by a man who said to his father , who carried a sign with the wor@@ ding : &quot; &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
you wat@@ ched a live feed in which a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of prot@@ esters with a bell@@ ant dog .
&quot; in another video , she said to be ent@@ s@@ ed another polic@@ eman and cr@@ ying : &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; rec@@ alled Fer@@ rell to her statement . &quot;
that is not the kind of murder that we have acc@@ ustom@@ ed to us and which we can give you typical .
at this moment I felt Sch@@ üt@@ tel@@ fro@@ st .
I was angry and w@@ ept . &quot;
she has a return flight and went home the next day .
&quot; after the land@@ ing around 23 p.m. she got her 6 year old daughter of the house of her father , and decided that the two next morning would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the subject of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; , &quot; in the chin from the 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a history of survival and prot@@ est , of love and loss , the strength and resistance , which consists of the sight of man living in the community and have filled the streets to request answers . &quot;
&quot; as a fer@@ rell with her daughter who carried a flower dress and a suitable crown , after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , defe@@ ats the two a conversation that she had countless times before this morning , about the black experience and black condition . &quot;
&quot; you remember how I have taught thee when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; re@@ minded them on what she said . &quot;
&quot; we now go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police have killed a 18 @-@ year boys and that was not right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take it , &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell later . &quot;
what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
you have to know it and it must be seen and raised in it .
&quot; it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the various layers of the black experience and the black Constitution and what we need to be free to free to liber@@ ate ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I am lucky to give you an experience in which they have personally experienced any e@@ kl@@ ants rac@@ ism , it is not different from the next black women . &quot;
&quot; I have the feeling , I would have her a bad service to keep them away . &quot;
&quot; the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Road , a place on the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a Camp@@ a@@ area as the acti@@ vi@@ sts on the potential non @-@ indic@@ t@@ ment of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there was Fer@@ rell and her daughter connected with a local business owners , the lunch did . &quot;
they prepared bags before and helped to pass them to prot@@ esters .
slowly began a new kind of activ@@ ism for Fer@@ rell shape .
&quot; my activ@@ ism has changed after August 9 , she said and noticed that she was regarded as a student at the University of Miss@@ ouri @-@ St. Louis president of the Min@@ ority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I had no experience in organizing . &quot;
it is all come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later he met Fer@@ rell during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ director of the movie . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her compan@@ am@@ ann Luc@@ as Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ si wanted to just &quot; document &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came to Fer@@ rell in the mind , &quot; do you want to document , or trying to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
&quot; this sc@@ ep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished through countless cases of people , often by white - in a community that benef@@ ited from her pain and their resistance . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently declared in an interview : &quot; &quot; we had heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and raised up their voices , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director of Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the field , which is known for its activ@@ ism to be pres@@ sur@@ es . &quot;
his commitment brought the project closer together with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ning sho@@ ots .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we speak , &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people will be represented , for so I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ ells experience - to show that it is in motion &quot; not about a mes@@ si@@ ah leader , but also a community that is coming together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the apparent participant in the movie . &quot;
&quot; what are documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ ells life , how they love and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed , when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that it has to give a certain viol@@ ability at this work and in the dis@@ ruption of black people .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ ells history repeatedly called the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three fo@@ unders of the movement , which are influenced by the kill@@ ings of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 the film &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as sw@@ ul . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we fight constantly on different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women need to carry the main load of everything . &quot;
Fol@@ low voted to notice that &quot; the movement is really kept by black women and many black women .
&quot; however , it is however that this is not an affir@@ mati@@ ative type of action that was selected by Fer@@ rell due to her identity as a heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who raised this energy , she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no coinci@@ dence , although it was at the front front , because in a life on these cros@@ ses as a black , gay woman is so much on the game . &quot;
you can feel her energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the message results in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on has long gone , but the raci@@ al connections between the church and the police have continued . &quot;
Fer@@ rell is due to gran@@ ting for 2 ½ years due to the block@@ age of a highway on a demonstration .
it describes the soci@@ opoli@@ tical atmosphere of the area they called their home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , she turned on a voc@@ al and she feels that memory since then she went three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on on the road . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love each other and support them .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; F@@ en@@ w@@ ahn &quot; : TV @-@ readers discuss about bit @-@ gallery
the bit gallery moves the people although they have not been built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping center at the southern side of the pedestrian zone has been out@@ dated since the first presentation of 2009 the population in suppor@@ ters and opponents .
cold leaves the subject to hardly any one .
&quot; on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; will be discussed . &quot;
&quot; while the one to the bit gallery say : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; that would be &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; does not need a man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi leg ) or simply simply : &quot; &quot; great &quot; &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot;
&quot; while the suppor@@ ters are building that a gallery will take more customers in the city , and also the rest of shops , f@@ ills the opponents , that then the pedestrian zone escape . &quot;
&quot; added : the gallery is planned exactly on the property , on which the peas@@ ant hall is available in the 13 market market@@ ed their products . &quot;
with the start of construction work will be an end .
&quot; the Gallery Mach@@ er want to integrate a market hall in new construction , namely to the Bed@@ a square with possibility to sit outside sitting . &quot;
Sim@@ one Rooms : &quot; we have been bought almost weekly in the farm@@ hall for many years .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cake of the land@@ lords always be very happy . &quot;
even the but@@ cher we have discovered for us .
we would like to wish that during and above all after the construction of the gallery a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there are also this .
&quot; in particular , the small @-@ market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ensing : &quot; whether direct market market@@ ed in a market hall in the gallery , comes to the amount of rent . &quot;
&quot; however , the course is likely to be low in the new project but not exactly low . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what &apos;s shopping in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; whether clothes , shoes , dru@@ g@@ - or supermarkets , I find that su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there are already enough in our city .
&quot; but you see how many stores are empty here , some for months and years . &quot;
&quot; but since there is not even an ordinary weekend market , it is more important that us at least preserved the market hall . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered here is fresh , is largely offered directly from the producer and is ob@@ end@@ lessly inexpensive . &quot;
&quot; as one sees , the stores are rented in a shopping center only by larger companies , because the dor@@ fers are often not portable for a retail@@ er . &quot;
&quot; special , special stores there is almost no more and what else is left , then there will probably be even disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping center with a market hall does not fit together .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
&quot; above all , where should the peas@@ ant hall during the construction time ? &quot;
the old ec@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even on time when the bit gallery will actually come .
or create the bit bit @-@ gallery already previously to distribute all shops from Bit@@ burg ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that will simply not work .
&quot; and a shopping center , which is empty , no one needs . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real peas@@ ant market instead of this gallery . &quot;
but for a peas@@ ant hall it is yes thanks to the w@@ ahn@@ der@@ nig many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg no place anymore .
&quot; when the peas@@ ant market is broken , will again disappear a piece of culture . &quot;
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist creates portra@@ its with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
&quot; in the middle of the room the fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York are many faces - white , black and brown , which are almost un@@ noticeable same - that hang on cab@@ ling of the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 Portra@@ its were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ far and Hair sections which were sent from Chelsea M@@ anning .
&quot; p@@ anning att@@ ending the inc@@ isions from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former secret service analy@@ st was to have had a 35 @-@ year prison quarters , after it made a secret of diplomatic announcements over the website Wiki@@ Le@@ aks . &quot;
the new exhibition which was opened on August 2 , is called A Be@@ coming res@@ emb@@ assy ( A suitable simil@@ arity ) . &quot;
&quot; it is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was converted into technology , computer science and art , and mut@@ anning , a trans@@ fusion and away dis@@ si@@ di@@ ment , whose condem@@ nation was converted by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his ministry . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA that could be extr@@ acted by M@@ anning data , and out of the 30 portra@@ its , like somebody could be interpreted with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways , as they can be interpreted as well as the intimate determin@@ ants of these interpre@@ tations - but also for identity . &quot;
&quot; M@@ anning , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already talked about the identification as woman , was condem@@ ned in 2013 because of 20 counts , including six verses against the esp@@ ion@@ age Act , Computer was and theft . &quot;
&quot; through the prison her picture was supp@@ res@@ sed , so much that there was only a single photo - a gran@@ ularity , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which m@@ anning are obvious un@@ likely at a tar@@ mac and a plat@@ eau Per@@ sur@@ es - with which it was associated with them . &quot;
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of her 2012 @-@ project &apos;@@ Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions .
&quot; in this produced the artist of for@@ eig@@ ners from for@@ ensic Ar@@ te@@ aches such as cigar@@ ettes , and ch@@ ew@@ ing g@@ um , bringing the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people might look . &quot;
&quot; this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a period of time . &quot;
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea M@@ anning , while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg with a press release of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not have visited this time and she could not be photograph@@ ed , therefore they took contact with Chelsea , and asked them if they wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
the artists and their inci@@ dence were un@@ resolved bri@@ eff@@ re@@ ties that inter@@ change@@ able several years in the course of two years .
they have even illustr@@ ated one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustr@@ ated Com@@ res@@ sed Images that would transform a future in which the President Chel@@ i@@ Move would transform the judgment and it would be able to see the exhibition in person .
&quot; that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was released , cre@@ ings release after seven bru@@ tal attacks in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome type of happ@@ en@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; there is now at the opening of the exhibition somewhat deeper and Star@@ kes , as Donald Tru@@ mp leads to a war against inform@@ ants from the government &apos;s government and against trans@@ gender troops to resolve new , cl@@ oning ways that he should actually fix . &quot;
&quot; as De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg after the strange timing of all these things was asked , she said that &quot; things happen from a certain reason . &quot;
&quot; in one on the wall of the gallery , the artistic statement called for M@@ anning with its over@@ sized signature of which ( &quot; &quot; i &quot; &quot; in their sur@@ name is provided with a heart ) an end of &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose basis of gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been . &quot;
the facing wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA @-@ sequ@@ enz - a exchange of C@@ s and GS and As , in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hop@@ ed , due to the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nu@@ cle@@ ot@@ ide after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) how amazing similar , at least in biological respects , we all are . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully bring that our gen@@ ome is not about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective them are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work from 2007 , trace Mem@@ ories , is also visible . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a dedicated room is an page from the above Com@@ ic @-@ Nov@@ elle . &quot;
&quot; it shows M@@ anning , as they dis@@ appears with a fre@@ eboard in the hand from the discipl@@ in@@ ark@@ as@@ ers of the United States like King @-@ Kong . &quot;
&quot; when they put your talk , then they have won . &quot;
&quot; so , never the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; said the artist , which greeted from Philadelphia . &quot;
&quot; I always come in a go@@ ose , if I talk about it . &quot;
&quot; M@@ anning has not seen the exhibition yet in person - as it was supposed to be taken in the Com@@ ic@@ book - but if they should do it , then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room of the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simulation . &quot;
&quot; it was also focused on how everything in the exhibition , up to size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ ature ) , in which their genetic hur@@ ry groups have been written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portra@@ its . &quot;
&quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement that feels like a mass movement , like the movement , which also emphas@@ ized behind their liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and a representative of the University of Oxford
&quot; a nation@@ wide man @-@ hunt is in G@@ ange for a professor at the North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , who had been sought after a husband in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fat@@ al inj@@ uries . &quot;

&quot; this is now a criminal issue that is investig@@ ated by the competent authorities and the North@@ western University cooperate with this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ b@@ age . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
a spok@@ es@@ person at the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help the U.S. Government authorities .
&quot; added , the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were shock@@ ed and want to set him . &quot;
&quot; Chief Communications Officer of the police authority of Chicago , Anthony Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi , said , he urge the susp@@ ected response to the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police has a vision of their position , and our efforts to locate them , &quot; &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call of the building car@@ et@@ aker of the Grand @-@ Plaza @-@ Building , who had just received a mysterious tip , who poss@@ esses that in apartment 1008 is something . &quot;

it was confirmed by security cameras that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were included in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the inhabitants : &quot; the police are currently working on the timeline and the background of the ear , and expl@@ ores a variety of moti@@ ves , including a possible domestic inci@@ dent occurr@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA roadmap in the near future &quot; - the Russian Vi@@ zep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
the Russian Vi@@ zep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it will not be long before the remaining criteria of the world @-@ anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) to restore the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency ( R@@ USA@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the schedule , R@@ USA@@ DA has the right to plan and test in collaboration with UK@@ AD ( UK anti @-@ d@@ oping ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA roadmap was updated in this regard , &quot; said Mut@@ iny on Thursday . &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the schedule of WA@@ DA to comply with the Code which describes the criteria for re@@ integration of R@@ USA@@ DA and recently published on the organization of the organization .
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could give rise to concern for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything was announced , everything is implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results are presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , he added . &quot;
&quot; however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list stated , however , that the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping authorities det@@ ects the results obtained by the WA@@ DA approved resear@@ ches by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to be responsible in Russian sports in Russian sports . &quot;
&quot; regarding the matter said Mut@@ ko : &quot; &quot; we lead the examination by because our anti @-@ d@@ oping system has made an error . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there was no state programmes , and we will not ad@@ mit something that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ k@@ os words voted with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping Commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian sales office R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov problems of the past gave Sm@@ ir@@ nov problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organisations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly called that the report is contro@@ versi@@ al positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; nobody has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot;
&quot; R@@ USA@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 in the course of the d@@ oping ski sc@@ and@@ als from the WA@@ DA by the implementation of d@@ ings@@ controls in Russia . &quot;
&quot; however , you have been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) . &quot;

a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is at the wax to help companies find out how their employees will feel .
&quot; by creating and licensing of software , which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it allows companies to conduct surveys , speci@@ alty groups and dem@@ ographic groups , and in some cases wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers , the C @-@ suite managers to handle and turn right to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software Analytics tools is used to measure employees . &quot;
&quot; salvation he said that she won a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the s@@ nap @-@ surveys and surveys by certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company that have shown at a glance , which units have the most complaints and which execu@@ tives low addi@@ tives results - so that you can bo@@ unce why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture , so that you have not been eng@@ ined at the top of the workplace culture , so that you have not disclosed to the next U@@ TF , who has been published in Sk@@ and@@ ale , who have spoken in Sk@@ and@@ ale , who have spoken to those who have spoken , pun@@ ished . &quot;
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t is this desire for an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business .

it also offers an anonymous SMS @-@ hot@@ line with the employees to register .
&quot; and if the main business leader is included , complaints can be directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the judgment of the public opinion has captured the Reg@@ ul@@ atoren , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and CEO of Conver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; if a company is found that its staff is bad@@ ly treated or un@@ ethical , it can experience precious consequences by consumers Bo@@ y@@ k@@ ott , worker @-@ flu@@ ids and plumbing , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25@@ ,000 employees and over 500 locations , conver@@ cent for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and methods and have a simple way to reach their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; sooner than one employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or e @-@ mail for the corporate headquarters , a formal complaint and hope that he was seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a in@@ tim@@ id@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said , there was no good opportunity to pursue the dis@@ comfort of staff . &quot;
&quot; now , since the company Conver@@ cent sets you can have problems that were previously identified before managers , which were hidden in offices in cities or countries - how discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ complicated practition@@ er , identified more quickly and addressed . &quot;
&quot; I can closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree vision into the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who runs the risk management Group by Ruby Tuesday . &quot;

it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of Venture Capital investors who support both start @-@ ups .
&quot; conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , which has been raised the entire capital to $ 47 million . &quot;

&quot; these investments are hardly surprising , given the net@@ worked nature of companies , culture and Venture Capital . &quot;
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees are more waiting than before .
in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only inser@@ ts .
employees want to have the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you will give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy , in a company feel that their voices is heard , and that the work you do is worth@@ while , then they feel more committed to making this company , said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Employee Experience at LinkedIn , which is used both conver@@ cent as well as G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors can ren@@ ew ren@@ dering when their portfolio companies are well run . company running well when employees work and engaged .
&quot; when the Analytics tools are third talking , commitment and the commitment of employees , it is not a miracle that you will find support . &quot;
data on employee commitment to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data are us@@ eless if the car@@ et@@ aker of a company will not take action .
&quot; in fact , when a company asks for your feedback , it may have an expect@@ ation that change on the path is . &quot;
&quot; and if the changes does not come quickly enough , or not at all , this can dis@@ appointments , and mail@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,@@ 000 suggestions , you need to be ready to have 4.000 talks , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who have left to rely on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow the staff , &quot; do you truly hear me ? &quot;
do you care about this ?
and who do not take care of why should I ?
&quot; Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , which is now given monthly staff surveys , was able to see measures on the same day when a problem will be reported via G@@ lin@@ t , so salvation . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees , she was new to organise and add several teams within the company and to add a communication training to tackle the problems . &quot;
&quot; in Ruby Tuesday , the company will always receive new insights about the staff , and it hopes that in a long run , this leads to a better binding of workers in an industry that is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose man , you will lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , then you will lose companies . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates the two @-@ days practices and makes a long day for the Bru@@ in
&quot; it goes on 23 p.m. , when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ players on one side of the new exercise fields of the team are talking on the campus . &quot;
some have moved their tri@@ angles and show the back full of silence from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team these unt@@ ested minutes a mid@@ day break .
&quot; players who are written to the summer courses , will return after the three @-@ hour exercise to their final check before it will return to the water@@ man Foot@@ ball Center . &quot;
&quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real stairs , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday became Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A eliminate two @-@ days exercises to facilitate the burden of players , and it has been extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three trainings of the U@@ C@@ LA should begin at 19 : 15 PM to meet the players already completed . &quot;
&quot; the compromise away from the two days is more than a day , at the beginning of the Camp@@ s almost one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six game times in West@@ wood practical exercises . &quot;
they should hold out in the course of August 18 exercises . 20 before the beginning of the formal playing surface for their pr@@ el@@ ude against Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he emphas@@ ise the rule of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add multiple routes to players another point . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous load three or four days on them , and it is very challenging &quot; , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they simply pushed it through , they pl@@ ains on , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think when we arrive until Saturday and we have more time , it will really be magnificent . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will finish their practices once the camp is finished , as given the clear sight@@ ings of its fields marked by an adjacent parking place and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that has already been replaced with ped@@ estri@@ ans , which is already no easy task . &quot;
&quot; Bru@@ in players should occup@@ y the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a Spatial that there may be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far to think that people can rent a room and then adjust it to it . &quot;
&quot; if you have the vide@@ ob@@ and of a exercise , it is quite a good deal . &quot;
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
I am not too big worry about it .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against coun@@ terf@@ eit news

&quot; the problem has become a major political issue , whereby the French elections were floo@@ ded in May with wrong stories , and Germany must be pun@@ ished in May , according to the social media networks , if it does not succeed , asser@@ ted post@@ ings as before the elections there in September fast . &quot;

creation of a comic @-@ level : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past the little Scot@@ ney Castle was to be seen in a squ@@ ee@@ ze music video and was for Margar@@ et Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ er and 1980 @-@ he was a lo@@ pf@@ lo@@ ch .
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history of his cozy seat at the C@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now available for inspiration for a graphical novel by Jam@@ ie Rhodes , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ erst@@ one with a pre@@ ference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the manus@@ cript of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; says he aw@@ aken . &quot;
what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documented the families that illustr@@ ated in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustr@@ ated by another , abandoned British artist , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Is@@ abel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rhodes , based on an archive : he wrote &quot; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British library - a project that he un@@ expected emotional . &quot;
&quot; I have only re@@ acted on the permanent pressure on the side of a letter , which was written by a double @-@ duck@@ s in the 1700 @-@ s , who worked for the Jaco@@ b@@ ins , &quot; says he says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thum@@ bs ! &quot;
&quot; and letters still sm@@ elled to smoke , because back then there was a fire because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the sm@@ ell has an effect , when he himself was also involved . &quot;
&quot; ah , I love Archive ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who be@@ aten so with old papers , that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; &quot; U@@ m honest &quot; ) it seems to be a little bit over@@ looked &quot; &quot; ) this seems to be true to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rhodes spent his days to explore the Vi@@ kt@@ ori@@ an &quot; new &quot; Castle , to study the archives and to study the many treasures and cur@@ i@@ ties of the castle , such as the assembled for walls and bottles , the centuries in the dit@@ ch had spent . &quot;
&quot; he emig@@ rated by the terrain , and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscap@@ ed people , garden@@ ers and sometimes also with the artists that worked at the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , night tran@@ k he &quot; Whiskey and started to write . &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust was received in 2006 as the last nar@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; as a Rhodes a decade later , the employees started to take care of the archive that he said than &quot; hundreds of years , in which ar@@ ist@@ ocr@@ ats said , &quot; Oh , wir@@ es it on the at@@ tic . &quot;
&quot; st@@ ats , letters from the time of the English Emp@@ ires , maps that he poss@@ essed : &quot; &quot; man could be boring , &quot; &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; but there was a pe@@ ach to have fought the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let all go his gear ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection will use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se on the wider history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which a man follows that the newly built castle leaves to join the peas@@ antry of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record from a tur@@ mo@@ il that occurred 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book with the title &apos; K@@ night@@ ly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rhodes . &quot;
&quot; the peas@@ antry began in this area and I thought , a insur@@ rection was a good start . &quot;
maybe the two are connected to each other ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly root@@ ed in the history of the castle , like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , who told the history of the Jes@@ u@@ it pat@@ ron who hid the family Dar@@ rell seven years during the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The Sm@@ ug@@ gler &apos; , in which the sm@@ ug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell out of the 18th century is represented by his own satisfaction ( a discovery that was made only years later than his coff@@ in was buried ) . &quot;
&quot; Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rhodes &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; the gentlemen of seemed to be gone again and giving money for things which they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell men rede@@ emed their shoulder @-@ crises , by doing rich old women - I imagine it as a h@@ aps well @-@ looking guys prior to adver@@ tise it with a talent . &quot;
after the end of its use in the castle Rhodes in search of other unique Schrei@@ b experiences
&quot; he has a two @-@ week stay in Finnish Wild@@ nis for a Com@@ ic novel about El@@ ke &apos;s novel about El@@ ke &apos;s novel , the grounds of an San@@ at@@ ori@@ ums of the early 20th century , which has been re@@ covered by nature since then . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back again , &quot; says he . &quot;
&quot; it was like : &quot; Oh , now I have to be done with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ub@@ dorf
with the envel@@ oping of the 301 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf has started the City of Bad Honnef on Friday their campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau of Thursday ) .
&quot; until Thursday , Mayor Otto Res@@ hoff and his marketing team at N@@ el@@ son Art@@ z , the logo and the slogan . &quot;
at the end of August it was supposed to give it as a highlight of the campaign to the island Gra@@ fen@@ ver@@ th .
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; or ? , &quot; ask the makers of action since yesterday on the post@@ ers at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel . &quot;
&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; write them on their yesterday free website . &quot;
but we use this measure to gain your attention .
and to make sure that the book is better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we are the firm convic@@ tion that we know as bad Hon@@ ky citizens to know the beauty and attr@@ ac@@ tiveness of our city very well . &quot;
&quot; in action it go to more than &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it means further . &quot;
&quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a general promises , one that gives the city an un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able all @-@ time stamp . &quot;
&quot; finally , they stand in the competition with other municipalities . &quot;
a mid @-@ dig@@ it amount will be the city of Bad Honnef their new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military forms in Turkey - Erdo@@ ğ@@ an fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August went to Ankara of the Upper Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) about Pen@@ sion@@ ations and ferti@@ liz@@ ations in the off@@ spring .
so this week .
at first glance a normal operation .
&quot; but nothing is routine for the Turkish armed forces , a year after the trial . &quot;
&quot; the meeting took place no longer in the building of the Secretary @-@ General , as before , but in the Prime Minister of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; we took part in the consultations under the pres@@ idency of the Government as well as the Minister of Defense , Home , Justice and Foreign Affairs . &quot;
the civilians were in the Y@@ AS in the number .
the government moves in the military the bre@@ eder .
&quot; the Secretary General of Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the avi@@ d forces and the na@@ vy were depos@@ ited . &quot;
since the curved coup@@ e has fallen Staat@@ sch@@ ef Erd@@ og@@ an 169 of the 326 Gener@@ als and Ad@@ mir@@ als .
&quot; over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of inn@@ umer@@ able connections to the movement of the Ex@@ il @-@ Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who sees the Erd@@ og@@ an as a wire @-@ level . &quot;
486 people who have been involved in Ankara for this week in Ankara for this week .
&quot; even on the day after the Put@@ sch had called Erd@@ og@@ an the over@@ throw &quot; &quot; worship &quot; , &quot; as he said to him the opportunity to puri@@ fy the armed forces &quot; . &quot; &quot;
but Erd@@ og@@ an the army is really in the handle ?
&quot; at the end of February the newspaper &quot; &quot; H@@ ür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article with the title &quot; dis@@ comfort in the military @-@ main quarters . &quot;
&quot; in the general strike it concerns concern for an increasing &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , among other things in the lifting of the head@@ tu@@ ch@@ ver@@ bot@@ s for sol@@ dat@@ ory manifest@@ ing , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
the grand@@ parents at the army and security forces in any way continues .
&quot; in mid @-@ July Erd@@ og@@ an , by decre@@ e another 73@@ 95 citizen , including 23@@ 03 polic@@ emen and 546 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed to be called Erd@@ og@@ an the military .
the gener@@ als are formerly known as the actual men of the country .
three thir@@ ds did they call upon his role as the gu@@ ardian of the world@@ ly State of State .
&quot; according to his choice of 2002 , Erd@@ og@@ an the power of the military &apos;s step by step back , not least by calling on the reforms of reform of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say that Erd@@ og@@ an t@@ rei@@ be targeted a Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Voc@@ al Europe &quot; &quot; war@@ ned a nam@@ ing officer of fear of persecution in foreign countries asylum , the Turkish army will be in a few years &quot; full of extrem@@ ists and sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; true , this could not let such development the Nat@@ o could not be cold . &quot;
&quot; in the alliance , there is no doubt about the cle@@ ans@@ ing of the Turkish army in the alliance after the cle@@ ans@@ ing of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; the executive structures and operational capabilities are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; say Nat@@ o @-@ diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for Green Card
&quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , President Donald Tru@@ mp , c@@ ited from the media . &quot;
&quot; he sees to reduce the leg@@ al immig@@ rants to 5@@ 0,000 per year , more str@@ ingent regulations for obtaining visa for a term work permit and restrictions for families @-@ oriented visa . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the Leg@@ isl@@ ative Dec@@ ree should be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do this by changing the U.S. the way the citizens from other countries Green Cards will be issued . &quot;
the law will prevent the chains migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will come to candidates to get the candidates who have the financial resources to assist themselves and show knowledge that our economy has come to good , &quot; said Tru@@ mp , c@@ ited by the American media . &quot;
Ministry wants to operate the track for rac@@ ist
&quot; over the past few months , over the future of the race @-@ sh@@ utt@@ les had been s@@ ard@@ ed over the past few months - now it should be quite fast . &quot;
&quot; even before the end of the year shall be built at the mar@@ sh route , on which the tourist bus goes to be built . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the race @-@ in @-@ long @-@ term , according to the information of the traffic Ministry in this year , we are beginning to start the circuit . &quot;
&quot; with the decision , the route from Il@@ men@@ au @-@ race will continue to order and to rest@@ oring the country especially for tourism important connection , &quot; explained traffic state Minister Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot;
the costs for repair of the route is estimated to roughly 2.5 million euros .
&quot; from this total , the country take 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , based on its basis the shuttle also shall be ordered in the future of the country , are currently designed to be definitive , stated S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the Ministry and Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen railway as an operator has already been informed about the technical details .
&quot; in order to tra@@ p the timetable , the used vehicles and quality standards , &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;

with this sol@@ le to be ordered the race @-@ shuttle on December 2017 .
the racing car Shuttle is an above all for tourists popular railway connection between the railway stations of Il@@ men@@ au and race .
&quot; over the past few months , the course of a fung@@ us have been tested , whether the track is used for sufficient many people to order them in the future . &quot;
the track is also strong in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should not worry
&quot; just as you thought that there are 2017 not even crazy , a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots . &quot;
yes .
Sex @-@ robots are currently a great thing .
recently released the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible robot@@ ics ) ( FR@@ R ) a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , em@@ eri@@ zed professor for robot@@ ics and artificial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and Co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must start their rise seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye @-@ color of the robot , its form of the nipp@@ le and the type of fingers . &quot;
&quot; people make themselves funny , but the company deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more frequent to see , &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key near the publication of his new report . &quot;
modern sho@@ ots have developed themselves from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a si@@ p skin which feels warm to feels - with deliber@@ ately human responses which can be achieved through the artificial Intelligence .
&quot; the user can adapt his robots even according to his bel@@ iefs , and thereby select everything from the eye of robot to the shape of the nipp@@ le to the type or color of his fingers . &quot;
&quot; but it is still more disturb@@ ing , as many robots have the &quot; person@@ alities &quot; that would be a st@@ eppe @-@ woman pro@@ gressi@@ vely . &quot;
modern sho@@ ots have turned to robots with a silicone skin .
&quot; the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x @-@ robots makes it for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties that can find it pleas@@ ing , such as sh@@ ari@@ zing . &quot;
and then there is still the True Compan@@ ion developed super@@ vised Gold Sex @-@ robots with pre@@ program@@ med figures such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of sh@@ ol@@ tern@@ ness and &quot; &quot; Wild Wendy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ uro@@ us &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ ous gold Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; sul@@ try the site of True Compan@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; so you like what you like , and they may not like what you do not like , etc . &quot;
it has in the course of the day her m@@ oods - quite as true people !
&quot; it can be tired , be fixed on conversation or she can be &quot; in mood . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are many disturb@@ ing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace true human relationships - but the lower feminine properties , the reference to im@@ al ( means here : contra@@ sting ) Far@@ rah goes , be@@ un@@ quiet one most . &quot;
&quot; on his website , True Compan@@ ion Tr@@ y xy with a vibration , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibration why do men then have no pot@@ tery ? &quot; does it mean on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex @-@ robots are not just a body or just just another sex . &quot;
&quot; your emergence and increasing sophistic@@ ation on something more dark , and deeper in our culture , to an withdrawal from the ideal equality of gender equality towards a desire for sex with sub@@ jug@@ ation as an optional addition . &quot;
&quot; most men will of course maintain no sex robots , and during FR@@ R their increasing pop@@ ular@@ ism , they remain provis@@ ional on the edge of consu@@ mer@@ culture . &quot;
&quot; but what led out of the edge zones , in relation to the spirit of time we live , in which we live , very instruc@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; and many people are not strange or busy , until they have the free market this permission . &quot;
&quot; but there is a certain rem@@ n@@ ant that these highly developed sex robots are threatened in a time in which the rights of women are threatened in which there is in the White House , who has recently been attacked to have wives sex@@ ually attacked . &quot;
the ab@@ ric@@ est aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s Tale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphical images which affects the body and the st@@ olen eyes but how realistic this vision works .
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a le@@ ap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big jump . &quot;
the goal behind this sex robots is to establish a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with Por@@ no@@ star pro@@ portions ) .
their buil@@ ders want to feel hum@@ ane that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but to the point when it comes to their &quot; person@@ alities , &quot; the robots do not represent real women . &quot;
you can not separate yourself from their companion or simply go away .
&quot; they do not have a medi@@ ation or a background of background , nothing , what to achieve independence or anything , what the fantas@@ y tot@@ aler sub@@ jug@@ ation could . &quot;
otherwise expressed : they are coun@@ terf@@ eit sl@@ aves .
or to express it in the re@@ design of 2017 : maid
Tru@@ mp@@ s Great Power ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the inner of healthy human traffic@@ king
&quot; it has become a bin@@ sen@@ sion of the Tru@@ mp @-@ era , that the political cre@@ ws have pol@@ ises the US @-@ constitu@@ ency , also families in small @-@ format . &quot;
&quot; around Christmas and Ern@@ ted@@ ank@@ fest , there were in the U.S. newspapers with advice on how to handle hor@@ ror of Tru@@ mp . &quot;
we are all alleg@@ edly to let us understand our filter bub@@ bles .
less noticed is the power of Tru@@ mp@@ s .
&quot; I consider this because my co@@ ous@@ ine , a left @-@ align@@ ed slideshow who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the repub@@ lic@@ ans in our family , who has visited this week in New York . &quot;
they re@@ minded me that the unity against a common enemy may have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tru@@ mp in the White House is everyone who knows them , including the Repub@@ li@@ can relationship , with which they fought for decades due to politics , suddenly and very strange on the same side . &quot;
&quot; in order to make the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it falls in a further context that this also brings significant risks with itself . &quot;
&quot; the Left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the resulting effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push us all to the right . &quot;
&quot; if we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; and Tru@@ mp , we refer to the cru@@ el opportunity to no longer end his mot@@ ions of a day . &quot;
&quot; however , there is a still fri@@ ght@@ ened long @-@ time scenario , in the Tru@@ mp Repub@@ li@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alizes , &quot; which appear at once in comparison to his standards suddenly as a term of failure . &quot;
&quot; I find myself today from an active no@@ stal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ neys to fall - the dog on the Aut@@ od@@ ach , the 14 % income tax ( but at least did we know as his tax statement ) - both in comparison to Tru@@ mp in fact a very mild pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; if Tru@@ mp goes , the next candidate of repub@@ lic@@ ans only be healthy to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my co@@ ous@@ ine in the city was , we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ egi@@ vers of the New York City department , and the best three dollars that you can in town , if you need no caff@@ eine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the Fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are kn@@ ur@@ ly and the animals are rot@@ ate to look full of fear about their own shoul@@ ders - and the kli@@ m@@ ous music conv@@ eys this in strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many sounds of a city dis@@ ap@@ point : the views of high buildings are old , the sky@@ lines will become familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream . &quot;
&quot; fifth year later , and I am still not completely over the day than I found that Swiss Cottage is in fact no Swiss Cottage is - the topics of pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a large roundabout in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; however , Central Park &apos;s carousel is still a strange magical experience , since two year @-@ year old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women have been going to go on it and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could evaluate the carousel , I would have given him the full score , but luck@@ ily no one has asked him . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced to rate this week in a department store , my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could draw my credit card . &quot;
&quot; at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to obtain the review with a 15 % drinking - this to buy something about the Lad@@ der . &quot;
&quot; this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also pres@@ sur@@ es pressure on the server to deposit personality into a situation in which no need is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department was ap@@ ologi@@ ingly gr@@ ins@@ ing , while I tired the experience made you get my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with breast pain from prison to hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for a hospital visits .
&quot; last year , he was brought to the hospital because of the treatment of Schn@@ itten in his hand , which he suffered the prison authorities according to a fall in his cell . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us was condem@@ ned because of the Mor@@ rison of the prosec@@ ut@@ ors against a first be@@ zz@@ lement .
he put ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valent@@ ine in 2013 by playing them several times through a door of the toil@@ ett@@ enk@@ ins in his house in Pret@@ oria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us declar@@ es that he held his girlfriend for a closer inv@@ aders who stopped in the cabin hidden .
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention , this time against the six @-@ year harbour of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , from which they say it be too . &quot;
&quot; the Nation@@ ale Criminal Authority said that they will raise the Supre@@ me Court of South Africa , and the obj@@ ection can be heard this year . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us running danger that its pun@@ ishment is increased on 15 years when the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .

&quot; &quot; &quot; school@@ ing Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the Civil House Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen . &quot;
&quot; as a symbol for debt relief the 29 students of four classes under the direction of Sop@@ hia Schum@@ acher and Reg@@ ine Meder an young Adler , who grows in the chick@@ ens , but then it will be released into the freedom . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the m@@ unter@@ e Sch@@ ar brought a Musical with the title &quot; The Adler in the chick@@ erhof . &quot;
&quot; Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and sent it out of his chick@@ ens . &quot;
instead of a chick@@ ens came a small Adler .
&quot; but the hope to make out of him a chicken , sm@@ ote the e@@ agle on a high mountain his wings from and escap@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes showed three and four in the study by Y@@ vonne Frank a chick@@ ens . &quot;
the ren@@ ame d@@ anced with the young go@@ ck@@ les , the cy@@ linders around the bet . &quot;
the e@@ agle stand for the integration , said school@@ ing Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te . &quot;
&quot; the young is different from other young animals ( cows ) , but they belong . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
his purpose is to be free .
she wanted to make every four @-@ kl@@ ets that he has believed in his new school .
&quot; it followed gratitude to the colleagues , the former school manager Michael Müller , who is always on again in lessons , and the parents &apos; parent . &quot;
the D@@ ken@@ ney was now over , stated class@@ room Sop@@ hia Schum@@ acher . &quot;
&quot; they never leave their students after two years of lessons , for it was a really great time . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it can rely on the quar@@ ry @-@ wire . &quot;
&quot; finally , all students can end a song of summer season and holiday periods . &quot;
in this case the children broke great joy .
for the new school year already eight first @-@ c@@ als are registered .

software update for diesel vehicles : what people have to know now
how exactly does the software update be held ?
do diesel drivers have to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers in overview .
&quot; at the diesel Summit BMW , Daim@@ ler , Opel and the VW Group software updates for a total of about 5,@@ 3 million cars offered . &quot;
they are supposed to improve the waste management of cars of the emissions of Euro 5 and partially Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ diesel or inf@@ erior to them are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in by ACE Auto Club Europe gives reviews :
is the new action comp@@ ulsory ?
no , the tra@@ ded software updates are optional . &quot;
&quot; the comp@@ ulsory updates before are only applicable to vehicles , the Schum@@ ann software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
its retro@@ fit has arranged the power@@ train Office ( KBA ) .
how and when are customers informed about updates ?
&quot; the makers have announced a fast implementation in the next months , but still no precise appointment . &quot;
&quot; Daim@@ ler has been informed , each person affected . &quot;
if any@@ body is pay@@ able in a inspection I will be done in their frame .
how long is the conver@@ sions within a total of time ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
the subject from the commitment of the manufacturer as well as from the political pressure .
&quot; for we have seen , voluntary acting the car manufacturers in the subject of environment so far . &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the conversion itself could last only three to four hours .
time @-@ up could be it to get an appointment .
&quot; what do drivers do not make any car from BMW , Daim@@ ler , Opel and the VW Group ? &quot;
the ace has to wait for the evening .
&quot; pres@@ um@@ ably , foreign manufacturers would draw up as S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
threat@@ ens now a massive Canc@@ ell@@ ation of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE are f@@ ear@@ ed .
&quot; but even in the regions , where driving is dro@@ p@@ ous . &quot;
in rural areas there is so far no added value for older diesel .
the ace wir@@ es , with a sale still wait . &quot;

we make the city worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , next year in R@@ ente . &quot;
&quot; however , the passage is already written - suitable applic@@ ants are however big . &quot;
for 31 years is W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ masters .
and the work is still great fun as he conv@@ eys in the pres@@ sur@@ es .
&quot; he reports of varied , but also challenging tasks that are waiting for its successor . &quot;
at the same time I am wonder@@ ing that far the application of the requirements .
the city is searching for the next time a architects or buil@@ ders .
&quot; thus , - considering the regular termin@@ ations - even enough time for development . &quot;
&quot; as Has@@ l@@ ach for the administrative community as a sub@@ contr@@ actor regulatory authority , the applic@@ ants must be required for the applic@@ ant . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
would it no longer be able to fill them out the citizens before proce@@ eding to Off@@ enburg .
&quot; but citi@@ zenship will be the city and himself , says W@@ acker , who reported by a good operation , as well as good mood between authority and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in office , some significant projects accum@@ ulated , to the wh@@ acker can look back with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city worth living , it is safe through the building office and its employees . &quot;
but also in the future are varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen@@ park approximately are tr@@ apped .
&quot; the chin bridge between B@@ oll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach will be renewed , even the stadium of stadium is still subject . &quot;
&quot; the latter alone will hit with approximately 1.5 million euros in be@@ ech , &quot; if we do it right , &quot; appreci@@ ates W@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
con@@ alter@@ ation be large for a Stadt@@ bau@@ masters of large toys .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own Bau@@ hof and garden@@ er can be re@@ acted very flexible to many .
&quot; you can move much &quot; , &quot; so wh@@ ack@@ ers , and the design of green plants will often be pra@@ ised by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; as the old town as ensemble under monument protection stands , be it important to have an eye for what it fits , &quot; if new builds are approved , st@@ resses the divi@@ dend town . &quot;
in bears the Stadt@@ bau@@ masters high responsibility .
&quot; he is buil@@ ders , &quot; at the end everything is going on my table . &quot;
&quot; with care and coordination he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been doing for ten years , Manfred Scho@@ er ( draft building ) has been already for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also , that his successor remains long , desires gu@@ ts : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to be identified with the place . &quot;
&quot; because continuity is not only important for a good business , but also for the further design of the city . &quot;
who wants Roland W@@ acker would like to show after information of the city of Has@@ l@@ ach a complete study as a diplom@@ acy or Bachelor &apos;s degree programs with specialist architecture and have good expertise in the areas of construction and construction planning .
&quot; the municipal office building and deep @-@ building , construction planning , le@@ under@@ age groups , administration of urban occup@@ ations , towns , Municip@@ ality , Municip@@ ality and Municip@@ al Institutions , including monument protection , including monument protection . &quot;
bike on wir@@ es : southern route is locked
&quot; according to police , the blue bike had not been thrown by the blue bike of the rail@@ road over@@ pass in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines . &quot;
these were so strongly damaged that the subsequent freight traffic had to be raised .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male offen@@ ders and look for the after@@ ward after them .
near the Tat@@ ort were witness@@ ed a ros@@ ar@@ ot@@ ary sco@@ or and a bike driver .
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ itzer , &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot;
the perpet@@ rators of the perpet@@ rators would have expressed itself in great danger and are also endanger@@ ed the train .
&quot; in addition to the damage to the L@@ ok and the plant , as well as the late @-@ minute drive and the cost of rail transportation could also be cont@@ ingent on the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; all in a total of a &quot; significant &quot; sum , &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
&quot; the damage were resolved in the morning , the train transport on the southern route could be guided without disabilities . &quot;
&quot; almost ten passenger cars were dropped an@@ mor@@ nings , two of which are regarded as correspondence . &quot;
&quot; goods did not come from , but they had delay . &quot;
according to Ö@@ BB @-@ speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be replaced approximately 200 meters of upper lines .
insul@@ ators and m@@ ast were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , milk products and chocolate could help , IB@@ D ( infl@@ am@@ oral intest@@ inal ) . &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound for your diges@@ tive system like a night@@ mare .
&quot; but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could the symptoms of patients with infl@@ amed bow@@ els . &quot;
&quot; the inc@@ urable condition , who concerns around 1.3 million and in Great Britain 300@@ .000 concerns , causing Mag@@ nets , repeti@@ tive or blo@@ ody cases , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; while those affected will normally get out , meat and dairy products found their symptoms , found researchers at the Wash@@ ington@@ er University , that the essential amino acid Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins can contribute to the immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; the conduc@@ tive resear@@ cher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , declared that immun@@ o cells in the intest@@ ine pat@@ rol , to ensure that dam@@ aging micro@@ ben that hide themselves in the body , not in the body . &quot;
&quot; cells that are able to compens@@ ate in@@ flamm@@ ations , are compens@@ ated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without scal@@ able tissue . &quot;
&quot; when the balance towards in@@ flamm@@ ation is circum@@ cis@@ ed , it can result from it a spont@@ aneous dis@@ cip@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in experim@@ ents has been established that a kind of tolerance conduc@@ ting immune cells at mi@@ ce , which carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their initi@@ ates . &quot;
and the bacter@@ ium needed Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the components of proteins - to charge the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have a connection between a bacter@@ ial type - Lac@@ tob@@ ac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the intest@@ ine micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that foster tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mi@@ ce in their food , the more they had them from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he proposed that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one of Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han rich diet toler@@ ated less infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory Dar@@ mm@@ ili@@ eus , when the same system is also used for people . &quot;
&quot; the post@@ doctor@@ al associations in Dr. Luisa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an taught a kind of immun@@ ity who had tolerance as they found that a group of course powers had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was separated , but this did not . &quot;
&quot; they assumed that the difference had to do with the intest@@ inal micro@@ omas of mi@@ ce - the community of bacteria , viruses and mushrooms , which usually live in the stomach @-@ intest@@ ine traction . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ är@@ me of the mi@@ ce became DNA sequ@@ ences and there were six bacter@@ ial species were found in the mi@@ ce with the immune cells , but without her at the mi@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; mi@@ ce have been raised in a ster@@ ile area so that they were not developed a intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ om , and they were not developed this kind of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells . &quot;
&quot; to understand how the bacteria have to grow on the immune system , the researchers created L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and carried out small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ri@@ pe immune cells , which were isolated from mi@@ ce . &quot;
the immune cells developed on the toler@@ anc@@ ill@@ ary cells .
&quot; as the active component was cleaned out of the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ Met@@ abol@@ ism , which is known as an in@@ do@@ l @-@ 3 @-@ lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; when the researchers have dup@@ licated the amount of Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han inside the feed of mi@@ ce , the number of such cells grew by about 50 percent , but if the pr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ values were hal@@ ved , s@@ ank the number of cells around half . &quot;
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes Bar@@ rag@@ an explained that people have the same toler@@ anc@@ ill@@ ful cells such as mi@@ ce and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our stomach @-@ intest@@ inal markets .
&quot; it is not known as Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ side @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i the cells in humans develop as with mi@@ ce , but Def@@ aul@@ ts in relation to Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with anti @-@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory disease . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote , since these cells are able to control in@@ flamm@@ ations on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot;
pot@@ entially can result high pol@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i to a extension of these populations .
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot; has committed
&quot; at Manchester United has signed with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot; , &quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ field player on Wednesday evening his debut at S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria had . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pounds of signature of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game , before the U@@ EF@@ A @-@ Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday begins , and impressive in the old part , as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira according to Bel@@ i@@ eben . &quot;
&quot; M@@ atic however was excluded from the Pre@@ par@@ ation Asia @-@ Tour of the blu@@ es , and managed only 45 minutes to improve M@@ our@@ in@@ ho that he had to improve before the Premier League @-@ season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time but his experience , intelligence , a gen@@ ius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him sooner than later be ready .
besides M@@ atic start@@ ups also Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u in Avi@@ va @-@ Stadi@@ on as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .
&quot; the Independent un@@ v@@ eil@@ ed in this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho nor three more re@@ comp@@ ings wished , but he insi@@ sted that the club has already made a &quot; fantastic job , &quot; three of his four pres@@ sur@@ prises . &quot;
&quot; three of four to get , thanks to the association , he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four of four out of four , but they have given great effort . &quot;
Bo@@ eing &quot; m@@ old &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Bo@@ eing has the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers in the sky painted .
&quot; the pil@@ ots fle@@ w by Seattle on the U.S. state , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in US state of Michigan , and moved in the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers over the U.S. , that are several thousand kilometers . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the rad@@ ar the shape of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers was to be .
the whole was a rec@@ tos@@ est for new engines .
Bo@@ eing had already made such advertising previously .
thus the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Bo@@ eing logo was painted in the sky .
&quot; new draft for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem
&quot; as the wind was turning : as Sig@@ mar Gabriel nor SPD @-@ Chef was , the Social @-@ Democratic Prime Minister before elections always ended with a certain concern to Berlin . &quot;
&quot; only no interference from the party @-@ central , only no counter@@ wind from the covenant - so loud the most important wish of the elect@@ oral competitions . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz has led the party , the fundament@@ ally changed . &quot;
since then the staff of the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus observe the events of the SPD @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus with growing relief the events in the SPD member states .
&quot; what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , with return wind was not described in the approach . &quot;
it were deep @-@ sur@@ es .
and one after another .
the federal @-@ CD@@ U sees the surprisingly end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony for a general signal against Co@@ unc@@ tions of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green can simply not ra@@ ste@@ ady rain , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ Secretary Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ N@@ D ) . &quot;
the surprising fr@@ action of a Gre@@ ens @-@ MEPs gave the government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) sc@@ ored in a heavy crisis .
&quot; five months before the country @-@ election , its red @-@ green coalition , thus its red @-@ cast majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the Gre@@ ens @-@ Bundes@@ cre@@ ators Michael Kell@@ ner has been promp@@ ted to reg@@ ain the Ab@@ di@@ ün@@ del El@@ ke T@@ ire to return her mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear exp@@ ir@@ ation of the laundry .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ ires must immediately give her mandate , &quot; said the Bundes@@ si@@ leader and elect@@ oral tra@@ der of the Gre@@ ens Network Germany ( R@@ N@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; this must be all not true , se@@ ated an SPD @-@ election , as in the morning the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ bot@@ ship reaches the party office . &quot;
&quot; Stephan W@@ eil , SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands after the passage of the green Members El@@ ke T@@ ires to the CD@@ U without their own constitution . &quot;
it is the provis@@ ional climax of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD .
and no one knows what comes next .
the mis@@ ery began with the un@@ expected defeat at the Saarland @-@ election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , cal@@ med down the com@@ rades . &quot;
after the day @-@ day elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North@@ rh@@ ine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia will be anything else .
it was then too - and it all was clearly worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the pig@@ ments , the D@@ us@@ sel@@ dorf @-@ pl@@ ast@@ ly turned the party . &quot;
m@@ ori@@ ous r@@ amp@@ ed the com@@ rades in the weeks then again .
&quot; then , when they had just met new courage , the G @-@ 20 @-@ Summit came from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him the next sign .
&quot; Mayor O@@ la@@ f Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD state , lost in that weekend his N@@ im@@ bus , because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ an@@ ic harmon@@ i@@ ously during his city . &quot;
&quot; and because he made pretty much wrong in the crisis communication , that it was doing wrong , what you can do wrong . &quot;
since then Sch@@ olz fighting its political survival .
now Stephan W@@ eil is now also Stephan W@@ eil .
because of the VW Sec@@ ond@@ ary and its role in the Supervisory Board of the Vice @-@ Sax@@ on Prime Minister has already been in the cri@@ tique of critic@@ isms .
mi@@ ese fr@@ ac@@ tures have been added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps it is why she tried to put the salvation over the past weeks always stronger , in the covenant of acc@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the former citizen of Hanover , to develop his power in Berlin , even com@@ rades in the environment of Martin Schulz remained hidden . &quot;
they left him because she spoke of a stabili@@ zation of the party .
&quot; now , the exact opposite could occur . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , W@@ eil meets the partial social constra@@ int , the lower countryside is basically no fault . &quot;
and Schulz certainly not at all .
obj@@ ectors will strive for the com@@ rades therefore to keep their own ranks .
&quot; your wr@@ ath is based on the Gre@@ ens , and here above all on the punc@@ tu@@ ation of parliament@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ bear@@ able and democratic , like Mrs. T@@ cz@@ ew their own care@@ ers over the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mier@@ sch , Chief of the German Bundestag in the SPD fac@@ est@@ al sf@@ action , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ N@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. T@@ ires is not elected because of their person as a direct channel plat@@ inum , but on the country list of the Dutch nature in the Parliament , so the decline of precip@@ itation . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns their mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Chief of the SPD fac@@ est@@ ag@@ gression , indic@@ ted a &quot; und@@ em@@ ocratic man@@ eu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; the weighing of four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan W@@ eil to the Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower SPD as a nickname in the bund@@ le choice , the R@@ N@@ D . &quot;
&quot; well , the personal career of a future CD@@ U members &quot; said the &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he called to clear the back@@ grounds .
I want to know if more has been there or there is further pl@@ agues of the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
conveying systems for the center III
&quot; who wants to work in the years , you can get assistance from the country soon . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of St@@ eg urban development on Wednesday in sensitive . &quot;
at the beginning of the information seminar Sch@@ ind@@ ler gave again a review on the so far .
since 1991 it has been received in sensitive san@@ itation .
&quot; back then , in the san@@ itation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the land Baden @-@ Württemberg has adopted two thir@@ ds of the conveyor . &quot;
&quot; in the renovation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the grant of the grant is still at 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous San@@ ations are a &quot; successful project &quot; - it is finally important to promote inner development , and not only new building areas . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , one received the information from the Presidency of the Presidency of the Federal Republic of Karlsruhe , that there will be a san@@ itation area III . &quot;
&quot; the funding total of 833 333 euros , of which sugars 500 000 Euro from the country , the rest of the congregation received . &quot;
how does a plumbing is now emerging ?
&quot; you will be further investig@@ ated as Sch@@ ind@@ ler further , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; but it also play a role , whether in the planned area there is interest to work . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the cant@@ ets@@ borders will then also be moved . &quot;
&quot; the pi@@ er represented on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; Keller presented the content of the federal government of the Social programme &quot; Social City , &quot; in which the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; core of the program are the re@@ vit@@ alization of internal cities , improving the living and employment relationships and preservation and expansion of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be obj@@ ectively related , which means per plot . &quot;
the san@@ itation area would eventually be defined as a stat@@ ute .
the auth@@ orization period for the funding period runs from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026 .
&quot; but until September this year , however , it would only once again be carried out the invent@@ ory , as part of those who received a ques@@ tionna@@ ire to fill in a ques@@ tionna@@ ire . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the proposition is to be done as the stat@@ utes that will be started in the coming year with the renov@@ ations . &quot;
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann explained that any Commun@@ e carry out the defe@@ ated investigations .
&quot; it is about to assess the urban @-@ teb@@ rates and decide when soft , and in what extent . &quot;
it will then also be entered for the respective property as well as an indic@@ ator in the basic book .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will again come again after received and get a picture of the location , she said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Got@@ zel stressed , an essential success factor for the project be the participation of the participants . &quot;
that is why I will post ques@@ tionnaires that will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled until the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; the yellow ques@@ tionna@@ ire is the &quot; &quot; building and real estate , &quot; in which it is related to the structural state and the san@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; in the gray ques@@ tionna@@ ire , the &quot; household and housing &quot; , &quot; data can be made to size , distribution and inhabitants of a residential area . &quot;
&quot; the blue &quot; &quot; operating arch &quot; &quot; is only to fill out if in building business spaces are operated . &quot;
&quot; however , to be noted , dism@@ is@@ sed to consider that a filled ques@@ tionna@@ ire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; moreover , new construction measures are not conduc@@ tive . &quot;
Sch@@ ind@@ ler said that the distribution of the conveyor according to the &quot; Wind@@ break@@ er &quot; work - who first comes , ma@@ ates first . &quot;
one could not be able to book funding for later . &quot;
&quot; on completion we have shown photos of the project &quot; &quot; town II &quot; &quot; to make the present a renovation . &quot;
bri@@ tish invent@@ ors is composed by yourself a micro@@ chip in order to come with a hand movement in home and car
&quot; a British invent@@ or is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that he can enter his door@@ step , his office enter and even start with a manual movement . &quot;
&quot; St@@ even North@@ am , 33 , had impl@@ anted the tiny chip between thumb and for@@ ef@@ inger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify lives with technology through its company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he has worked with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a Consult@@ ative An@@ a@@ es@@ thesi@@ ologists at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , in order to ensure that the impl@@ ant procedures are carried out after medical standard . &quot;
the technology res@@ em@@ bles a cats and dogs impl@@ anted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the locks on houses and cars , that they are compatible with the chip , everything available at a surcharge of £ 300 per castle . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one has now built at home as well as with its BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
the ship@@ ments of the wh@@ ites cost the tax@@ pay@@ ers of thousands .
&quot; the decision of the White House , a Marine @-@ heli@@ copter to the South Law@@ n for an event to fly , which costs an American production last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the data of the military that have been left to the TI@@ ME magazine , up to 24.@@ 000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , the heart of the event was on 17th July in the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and conduc@@ tive officials made a tour of products from all 50 states . &quot;
&quot; the forti@@ fied heli@@ copter was issued alongside a yacht out of Ma@@ ine , a fire@@ man from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a for@@ kli@@ ft of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; the military office of the White House slow@@ ed the presence of heli@@ copter in a frag@@ mentary order or F@@ RA@@ GO , barely 36 hours before the heli@@ copter on the South Law@@ n land@@ ed , after the records of the Marine Hel@@ i@@ copter SQ@@ UA@@ DR@@ ON One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit which is responsible for the operation of the heli@@ copter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted to realize that you are aware of that , because it is such an un@@ common event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the com@@ man@@ de@@ ur of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 at the eve of the event its predec@@ essor , the Deputy Marin@@ ekom@@ man@@ de@@ ur for avi@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the message showed that the heli@@ copter was born on 17 July at 7 am in the South Law@@ n for the event at 3 p.m. , and so long stayed until the lawn between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 p.m. on this evening was vac@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the note adds that , if the departure from the White House would be del@@ ayed , due to the restriction of the service hours a second team would require for the return flight . &quot;
the original aircraft was presented during the event by the heli@@ copter while the security of unity during the time on the ground remained by plane .
&quot; derived from the records made by the TI@@ ME , not clear whether ultimately a second leaf@@ let was required . &quot;
H@@ atch Act ver@@ ges the federal government to use state @-@ owned property for political purposes .
dat@@ as@@ ets show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event might viol@@ ate the determination .
&quot; a question we asked , whether it was about a violation of the H@@ atch , and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the command@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; sounds , as if you are closed , &quot; rep@@ lied the Deputy command . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political upper @-@ t@@ ints .
&quot; at the event , the President gave a bre@@ ach of the reform of health reform that was in the Senate during the Senate , and it propag@@ ate the efforts to prepare the government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft , which is known as Marine One or Air Force One , from politically beneficial effects is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot;
Pres@@ idents are oblig@@ ated to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo race is un@@ common .
&quot; Tru@@ mp was conducted in February a study by the background of its first Kamp@@ agn@@ e@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , Tax@@ i@@ services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that describe their predec@@ essor through its predec@@ essor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products made from all 50 countries , which are manufactured by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the Deputy Pres@@ ses@@ ame of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 occup@@ ations often lead training tours in the area around Washington and in the South Law@@ n by giving the U.S. president in the White House with precise cen@@ tim@@ eters .
&quot; as Tru@@ mp early July at the G@@ 20 Summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 im Wei@@ den House 58 exercises . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event was appointed under the training needs of the flight . &quot;
&quot; Hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units fle@@ w in addition to 11 hours on this day for &quot; &quot; non @-@ pres@@ idency &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the White House said that the tax pay@@ ers the burden for none of the other re@@ ps , which were presented on the event . &quot;
a spok@@ es@@ person about Si@@ kor@@ sky said the company was not involved in part to represent the heli@@ cop@@ ters in the South Law@@ n .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 holds no budget for the presidential and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
&quot; according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ fen of the U.S. Ministry of Defence , for the fiscal year 2017 is the D@@ od @-@ workshop for the V@@ H @-@ 3D however 24.@@ 380 USD per flight @-@ hour . &quot;
record of unity directories the flight time of aircraft than 30 minutes from the home base of Marine Cor@@ ps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operation of heli@@ copter is far below that rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on the estimates of estimates for refund is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs , which are included in the annual funding . &quot;
&quot; according to a mar@@ gin from 2015 , the refund rates for D@@ od do not include personnel costs , but take into consideration the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract closure . &quot;
&quot; at this time the former Pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ y of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , the use of heli@@ copter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present this week things which are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the State of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I go that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot;
&quot; and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the heli@@ copter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have been un@@ ti@@ rel@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is reasonable that is to be prefer@@ able . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether Tru@@ mp with the heli@@ copter was inter@@ viewed as he pra@@ yed to the South Law@@ n for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire@@ man . &quot;
in the White House Tru@@ mp spoke to the representatives of Si@@ kor@@ ts@@ sky and jok@@ er with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the President , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

in the urban kinder@@ gart@@ ens the clock will return .
&quot; for the 1st of September , the city Kre@@ feld takes over the dining area in the urban children &apos;s facilities ( kit@@ as ) again . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ance , Deputy Head in the field of youth , this is a good news : &quot; we all have very happy . &quot;

&quot; the city operates in the fields of 46 child@@ care centres , in 44 get the children at lun@@ ar time a warm meal . &quot;
&quot; in the last kite year , 2800 children at the tables , and the need is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , not only children , the 45 week@@ days will be looked after , in the K@@ ita &quot; , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot;

&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot;
the size - there are two group@@ ed as sevent@@ y institutions - deci@@ des on the amount of time .
&quot; the kitchen @-@ hel@@ mets belong now firmly to the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; so they are much stronger and it is easier to implement the kit@@ al@@ ment , ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot;
for this is why it is : healthy eating and cooking lessons .
the children should help to prepare the food .
direct connection to the kitchen force of the team is there meaning@@ ful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known strength in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar with them and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the cle@@ ans@@ ing of the K@@ ita spaces - so far the task of the kitchen of the kitchen - will be done in the future of special det@@ erg@@ ents .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and cooking service - has also the charm of quality improvement of the kitchen also the charm that it turned into cost between a self @-@ ra@@ iny and per@@ cep@@ tive to the city as the most economical , it means of the press . &quot;

G@@ MB concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie @-@ factory in Glas@@ gow
&quot; a trade union aims at management of the Bis@@ ku@@ it @-@ manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie on long @-@ term commitment to production in their work in Glas@@ gow . &quot;
G@@ MB Scotland said the company for@@ ged over the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the work , which is next to other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea K@@ ek@@ se . &quot;
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pl@@ adi@@ s said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that employees and union representatives were experienced as first as their activities would change .
&quot; in a letter to the branches of the company called G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s to express their concerns , that funding will not be prescribed for the modernis@@ ation of production lines . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ organiz@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can win from the General Terms and Investment Manager for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , concerns our members . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; generations of families have worked here and the work@@ force focus strongly on the local community and the Greater Glas@@ gow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social dis@@ advantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , the wage and of prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising of life of life and the chron@@ ological production process , the eastern end of Glas@@ gow strongly is urg@@ ently an thri@@ ving production level at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a speaker of Pl@@ adi@@ s said : &quot; the Fili@@ p@@ ei@@ ter at T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to it , as we value the continuous commitment among employees and trade representatives . &quot;
&quot; we had a regular meetings with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees , that we operate like all companies that are continuously checked in an extremely competitive and non @-@ safe economic climate , our business is continuously checked - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to competitive competitive . &quot;
&quot; in recent years you added : &quot; &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site , and all of them should change our work@@ flows at the site , the employees and their trade union representatives are the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PSG ProntoSIL Barcelona have war@@ ned three years ago in front of N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the page of La Liga likes their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Germain is not veri@@ fied in its persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar , after having received a quot@@ ation of £ 189 million in order to compens@@ ate for its release periods , but they have war@@ ned Barcelona three years ago at the world premiere . &quot;
&quot; the sens@@ ational approach has attached the Trans@@ fer@@ window in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 @-@ club is ready to break the world record , whereby Paul Pog@@ ba has returned to Manchester United last season for 89 million pounds . &quot;
&quot; after the ending will be N@@ ey@@ mar for the first player in the world , and for the highest professional ath@@ letes of the world . PSG offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is angry about the way , as N@@ ey@@ mar has been forced his way out there , although a source in the proximity of the Catal@@ ans officers has given that the club has always been his best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 to take care of it . &quot;
but became the football world three years ago from the PSG - President of this prospect been war@@ ned ?
&quot; when Manchester City 2014 are interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for each club who wanted to draw one of the best players from PSG . &quot;
&quot; I am not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , then we will contact opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to draw one of our players to sign up , this will have consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have exc@@ eeded those line with the Spanish association at the beginning of this summer interest in the PSG - Mittel@@ feld@@ player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti express .
&quot; I made it clear that they would not allow it to pass the International from Italy under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by taking one of their prizes for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;

the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report for the abuse of the mis@@ sil@@ os @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
the mean author and histori@@ ans Michael H@@ es@@ emann .
the final report on the ab@@ dom@@ inal sc@@ andal with the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continue for discussions .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , speaker of the reform &quot; &quot; We are Church &quot; &quot; declared to release from former Reg@@ ens@@ burger Bis@@ hop and today Card@@ inal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Dom@@ ini@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year &apos;s brother of Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI . , an exc@@ use . &quot;
&quot; it would be very serving the reputation of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger can express their profound needs about their own sub @-@ om@@ issions or their at that time false estimate of the proceedings . &quot;
&quot; the Vatican &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano &quot; , &quot; on the other hand also cri@@ tici@@ zed that during the reporting on violence among Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ( &quot; two dimensions &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the gri@@ ps in Reg@@ ensburg , there is no one that it would have to be sh@@ red@@ ded and sh@@ ame@@ ful de@@ eds , but the &quot; degree medi@@ al manip@@ ulation &quot; , &quot; be the &quot; degree medi@@ al manip@@ ulation &quot; , &quot; as the &quot; degree medi@@ al manip@@ ulation , histori@@ ans and member of the national Italian Bio@@ eth@@ ics Committee . &quot;
&quot; the hab@@ it , the Catholic Church as a source of all evil experience , is already part of the day experience and preparing the public opinion that is ready for normal &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
also Für@@ stin Gl@@ oria by Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is said in an interview with the Bayer@@ ischer Rund@@ funk : &quot; you are happy to go on the church and this is a ti@@ ff@@ ed fat .
&quot; moreover they pointed out that in their youth &quot; blow@@ s have been a quite normal ped@@ agog@@ ical means &quot; to be with joy@@ ful children , as I was one , ready to finish . &quot;
&quot; they f@@ uses it un@@ fair , present standards on previous decades , because the world changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with the reports of the abuse of the abuse of cases , the brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appears . &quot;
&quot; totally to Un@@ fairly , the author and histori@@ ans Michael H@@ es@@ emann , who translated with R@@ atz@@ inger the reminder &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; &quot; to be translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says H@@ es@@ emann , &quot; for all that had nothing to do with him , he evaluated the results of the final report . &quot;
what exactly stands in the 440 @-@ sei@@ ze report that has submitted by the di@@ oc@@ ese Reg@@ ensburg with the En@@ light@@ an attorney Ulrich Weber ?
a total of 547 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; with high pl@@ au@@ sibility &quot; victims of gri@@ ps , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen sex@@ ually ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; in the final report it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , which was active from 1964 to 1994 in Reg@@ ensburg : &quot; &quot; summary , so that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms of physical and psych@@ ic violence have been applied . &quot;
&quot; especially with high emot@@ ion of emot@@ ion , the stocks could also fall even more fier@@ ce for the pup@@ il . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in contrast to numerous other compl@@ ains that many victims suffer the general humanity by R. estimated and therefore in numerous cases despite violence even more positive memories with it . &quot;
in interview H@@ es@@ emann , why the Final Report on the abuse of the Miss@@ ouri domin@@ ates by the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger of his opinion . &quot;
Mr. H@@ es@@ emann , the 440 @-@ pages report on the &quot; inci@@ dents of violence by the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; gives a contra@@ dic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ ini@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; to raise many students his &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for the other he also appears as ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ ker and perf@@ ection@@ ist , who became more tan@@ gi@@ ble when a dom@@ en musi@@ cally brought a top performance . &quot;
how do you evaluate as his bio @-@ graph this final report ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ man : when one reads the trouble and reads all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself quite a question why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all ahead of it . &quot;
it is once dedicated to him and he is clearly devoted to each sus@@ pic@@ ion of the middle or co@@ co @-@ hood during the terrible cases sexual abuse .
also the violence of violence in the early school is out of its active sphere .
&quot; one can throw him all , too late , or have not taken seriously enough to have taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ zhou , in which he was effective , was concei@@ ved by practically all respon@@ dents - as literally - &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
&quot; thus also the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger represents an excellent record , describes it as &quot; &quot; warm , &quot; &quot; sinc@@ ere &quot; , &quot; &quot; sinc@@ ere &quot; , &quot; &quot; sinc@@ ere &quot; , &quot; &quot; sinc@@ ere &quot; &quot; and &apos; understand@@ able , &quot; &quot; was carried out regularly with cakes , bis@@ cuits and Bon@@ b@@ ons , and &apos; always from grapes from children . &quot;
&quot; merely a minority concerns about his perf@@ ection@@ ism and its high emot@@ ion , which led even to wo@@ unds . &quot;
&quot; that he did not only cast with some chairs and cast them on the ground , but also ear@@ che@@ ered guys to the hair , or ears , he has already been pl@@ anted in years ago , deeply regret and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it . &quot;
&quot; said to his salvation , however , we must be said that such education methods in the frag@@ ile time , the 1960@@ s and 1970@@ s , were widespread in parents just as with teachers . &quot;
do you also know such bre@@ eders methods ?
&quot; of course , I think each of us who was born in 1968 . &quot;
&quot; also I have experienced this in a world@@ ly school , a state @-@ Gymnasium . &quot;
&quot; compared to the , what actually goes in this report , namely the det@@ ective sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the fore@@ front , are the free bag@@ at@@ elles . &quot;
&quot; if you ask yourself whether it was not more likely to do with his famili@@ arity and his role as brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media has just put it into him . &quot;
&quot; on the Bav@@ arian pop@@ e , many who have never understood it , still un@@ free@@ ze . &quot;
the truth is : the report is dischar@@ ged Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
in connection with the report a lot about the topic of abuse at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the Final Report as well as some negoti@@ ation or co @-@ operation with regard to sexual abuse for the load ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : quite clearly no .
not only the 67 victims of sex@@ ually over@@ gri@@ ps claimed to have become familiar to the Dom@@ ini@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; I have never done myself to talk to my Father or my mother , &quot; &quot; said a suffer@@ er substitute for the others , &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing . &quot;
the real problem with the education of sex@@ ually abuse was and is however that most victims should be silent .
&quot; if they didn &apos;t even know parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then definitely not a ch@@ oral conductor , the nevertheless , a colleague of the perpet@@ rators would have been . &quot;
how do you rate the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students R@@ atz@@ ing@@ ers &apos;s role in regard to the mis@@ use cases ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : a ques@@ tioned student form@@ uli@@ ed it so : &quot; in terms of sexual abuse ... I see ... not yet , in which he would have had the timely findings and have been able to hold the respective offen@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; I consider it ... even for really absur@@ d , accept that there is well ... bub@@ bles interven@@ e or clear or even more recently opened , as compared to their parents , dor@@ mit@@ ory , trust , etc . &quot;
that you talk to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; thus , the report comes to the very clear outcome : &quot; &quot; that it was affected in the occurr@@ ing student and / or its surroundings , could not be confirmed in the context of the examination . &quot;
what sexual abuse affects is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger so un@@ answered by every co @-@ operation .
&quot; thus , it cannot be disc@@ ard@@ ed to him not to be prevented or brought it to the ad . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to bring its good name to these ref@@ lex crimes , as unfortunately it happened in some cases . &quot;
in the media a great deal of &quot; violence &quot; to read on the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the former Dom@@ ini@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thrown in the report &quot; away . &quot;
must he live with this fore@@ front ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ man : this is the great problem that in reporting everything was missing and cur@@ sed become a huge mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and violence , and somewhere , in the middle of the inside , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; however , this is precisely the abuse of the report . &quot;
&quot; namely is clean separated : between the school and the Gymnasium of Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violence , as well as , we say once , other cau@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report consists of the time since 1945 , so also for four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger does not have ch@@ oral leaders of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the whole terrible test education , the cases , in which l@@ acks of sa@@ di@@ sti@@ c cur@@ ators have been nar@@ row@@ ed and mal@@ ign@@ ed , opened themselves at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous states have to have . &quot;
&quot; but with whom Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , for he got the boys first on the face , when they were already on the cathedral . &quot;
&quot; on that was , like most of the witnesses emph@@ asi@@ ze , the subject of &quot; &quot; primary &quot; &quot; tab@@ at@@ u &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; one was just happy to be coming and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise &quot; states . &quot; &quot;
what was different at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ouw ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ man : there was already discipline , but just no sa@@ di@@ stic violence . &quot;
&quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims occur the general humanity by R. estimated , and therefore in numerous cases despite violence even more positive memories with it . &quot;
&quot; thus remains at the most at the most fore@@ front , to have done . &quot;
&quot; but despite all efforts , the report was able to define only two periods in which it was reported from the states at the fore@@ front . &quot;
&quot; the first time 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish itself and was responsible for the occurr@@ ence at a school , where he was not real and responsible , ( such a witness ) was nothing to hear , and then just about 1993 . &quot;
Sh@@ utter@@ ed Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in front of the states consistently the ears ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ zhou , which the report is even re@@ produced . &quot;
&quot; in it , he proves that in the early school , the test will continue to be practic@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; already in the face of the risk of negative press Release , he recommended urgent need . &quot;
&quot; this was of course at a time , as a legal clarity , as a test should also be b@@ anned in Bavaria too . &quot;
&quot; before that , she inv@@ ented itself in a legal gray area , as everyone of us are still white . &quot;
&quot; there was also difficult for him to estimate where the affected might have passed , or dram@@ ati@@ zed , and where really the per@@ missible border was exc@@ eeded . &quot;
&quot; but you can also not say , he would have always been away . &quot;
this is just true .
&quot; only in 1980 , the test penalty was officially completed in Bavaria too . &quot;
&quot; Für@@ stin Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is said yes , it may be un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ agog@@ ical standards at that time . &quot;
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : we speak hist@@ orian to speak of the &quot; Fall@@ stri@@ ck of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; , &quot; thus the danger to assess the moral standards . &quot;
the prince of the Princess has already been right .
&quot; but of course , this does not apply to sexual abuse at all times , and not for what was inter@@ rup@@ ed in the early school of resistance and violence to inno@@ cent child labour , which goes far beyond that at that time . &quot;
this is all really hor@@ ri@@ ble and I am glad that it will finally be recorded .
&quot; but at the same time I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all that had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means for the discipl@@ in@@ ation and bur@@ sting , thus to move back and to the hair , were widely used in the 1970@@ s . &quot;
as physical bur@@ ying then it has not been b@@ anned from it .
which picture of his govern@@ or time has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger for talks with you for the book &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; ?
came the subject of audi@@ ts as well as language ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ man : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , i.e. Pope Benedi@@ c@@ ts X@@ VI@@ . , tells of his perspective , since played the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen only a secondary role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I am not sure that he led there a stric@@ ter Reg@@ im@@ ent there . &quot;
&quot; but even this must be said once again : without these perf@@ ection@@ ism , without the demand un@@ related discipline , it would not have been possible to form an institution of pupp@@ et , true cultural botan@@ ists of Europe and his musical tradition , which went almost twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone , one makes no great singers and stand before every success , right in which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ over@@ coming . &quot;
as what kind of people have you experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during talks about her book ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ man : through the work on the book and in addition , I have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well and again experienced as wonderful , humor@@ ous , fundamental , very respect@@ ful and heart@@ y people , from which one could not imagine that he could also do slightly from a fly . &quot;
&quot; I regularly come regularly with how many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen still today , 23 years after his em@@ eri@@ zation , regularly contact to him who visit him - he is almost blind and treat him as a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who are not for@@ give him until today , that he was once strictly to them , so are clearly in the minority . &quot;
most Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are grateful to him today that he enrich@@ ed their lives and took the world of music .
&quot; and that he always was a good , v@@ ä@@ ter@@ ly teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect of respect , to which they still look up and to worship them . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again , all that you ins@@ ates him , are arous@@ al methods that were then on the order of the day . &quot;
we can be glad that we have long ago overcome this time .
&quot; but it is highly un@@ just , a man , just because it is prominent and has an even prominent brother to make medi@@ al sin @-@ bu@@ ck . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil int@@ ent that stands behind it , just too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which was just published , dischar@@ ged him . &quot;
&quot; now the asc@@ end areas , a 93 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great publishers and perhaps even Germany no man know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
