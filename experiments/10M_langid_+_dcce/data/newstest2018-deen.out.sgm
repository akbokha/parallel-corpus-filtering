<seg id="67">Wedezauntsproject is Elemental</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischerbacher Weidezaun-Project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU-Bundestagenten Peter Weiss und Kordula Kovac have provided a picture on site.</seg>
<seg id="70">"at the spell of the family pidemann met the representative of the hereditary CDU, together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann granted first insights into his farm, in which he has 55 hectares meadows and 40 hectares of forest, and 40 hectares of wood supplies and also housed in five apartments's holiday houses."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" "Black" "is for him the alternativeless marketer for the milk of his cows, so pidemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengees only Regionales comes exclusively in regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"as he is also BLHV Chairman of fishing bach, he referred to the pastoral project as" elacelist. ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I can not compensate on derart areas not cited economy.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the green area care for much work, much to be dealt with with the motor sense."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have been struggling with the terms and conditions and with the Topics," says Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the elementary operation and crops these without chemical plant protection and fertilizers even if he will not lead a biooperation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" the Commune recognised the meaning of the pasture research project, and is pleased to support the leader. "</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euro per hectare would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">"" "I hope that the forestation of the surfaces could still be taken out for quite a while."</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have, the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts on how they continue to bring her operation," stressed the mayor. "</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often expressed in criticism</seg>
<seg id="84">Over the pastoral funding were fenced in 2013 a total of 25 plots from eleven nations.</seg>
<seg id="85">The disclosure area is thus 40 hectares that may not be recorded until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">"from the overall cost of 71 500 Euro the half costs was funded by the leader, a quarter carried the municipality of Fisbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus the farmers had 12 610 euros, they had to invest in 16.2 km of Weidezaun."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," said Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac stressed: "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and landing it doesn't go."</seg>
<seg id="90">Also for Peter Weiss stood firm: "here are best food produced."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscrap-linear (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state promotion of Weidezäunen.</seg>
<seg id="92">Goal is the disclosure of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">Prerequisite is the presence of one of the LPR bezzled conveyor belt.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the appropriate area may not be insufficient (landmark above 35 percent) and must be threatened by the forestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the Fischerbacher Weidezauntsproject 2018 is currently running the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build a short of 16 kilometers."</seg>
<seg id="96">The disclosure area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calypulated costs are more than 112 000. "</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest character of a regime change is it when they begin to attain the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">"the Americans appreciate this as any other - therefore the careely insulated storm Saddam Hussone at the Firing place in Baghdad in 2003."</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, knew sure what he did, when he took a symbolic battle with Jim Acosta of CNN on the proposals of the President to the drastic limitation of illegal immigration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">To remain fair but Miller does not have the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of bootlandowners and Liberty Imitators would have suffered it if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he laid down their significance, and in particular the meaning that it was written, when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after completion of the monument."</seg>
<seg id="105">"when Miller Acosta arimed:" "I don't want to go into a full thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... an icon of American freedom, that the world is illuminated."</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem that you refer to which later was added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is knowledgeable, but as he formed it itself, it is not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary resonance on the elaborate words of Lazarus, the only ones where a state is not only any old immigrants, but the hassles of the poor:" "your arms, your arms, / your bedy masses, who like to breathe free to breathe, / the defending abfall of your rich coast."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "elementary waste" on our screens was better to see.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller constituted not in literary criticism - he clearly made that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict due to the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural confrontation: it is indeed a conflict in the significance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who set up their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they had taken a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by being presented in a secluded classic imaging display the female embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem is the feminine figure out of no longer tract - it has obtained a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And there is itself a very different name: mother of Exilants.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the sex with the image is a brilliant feminist Coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and exactly how Lazarus changed the importance of the statue, the people wanted to return from the right wing this already for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the big screens as Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued 2010, that the Statue of Liberty was not one, but rather an early neo-conservative, but rather an early neo-conservative world is going ahead:" Lady Liberty goes forward. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It shall bear the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch is not to enlighten the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is libaugh here on something stolen.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is quite and certainly a matter of perception of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus consisted of Lazarus to see how it was seen from the exhaustive, but hopeful people have seen after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"it is in the truest way to see the world from the perspective of people, seek refuge and to improve a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and of the welcome that they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this is of course not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever wish to recognise.</seg>
<seg id="127">"your torch is not to illuminate the way, but the hatred, who is their only source of power, spontaneously."</seg>
<seg id="128">World championship 2017: Neil Black lobt's members of the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle reminds of a time when only two screams belonged to the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">"the auditor of the athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-four-dropltic controversies in the World Championships is a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 which starts on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">"black believes that" "in Scotland has been something special" "and the athletics of the United Kingdom has to learn from it."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it, and we try to understand and we will continue it until we find it" "said Black."</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think that it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The schottic athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the guy on the corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of the circumstances is absolutely brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the schottic Athleten are medals presented, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - the fight against Sir Mo Farah on the 5.000 m distance, while Eiliie Doyle was elected by the team of the team's team."</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is pretty modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"your capitals speech was incredible," says Black. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were schottically or wherever they live or exercise, went out of space and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the real feeling, the Eilidh was very natural, of course were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth-silver medallions, who is in her fifth World Championships for the 400-m hurdles, says that it is" incredible "" that 16 carrots in the British team. "</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championships was seven, the 1983 and 2015 were achieved. "</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle-runners Muir leads on this road and last year five British and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m away."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, the 1,500 m runs, is another shot of a great season that should be observed in the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">The Doyle reminds of her first World Championships as the only other contactor in the team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the Mannorts chapter says that they are" great pride "to the fact that many of their landings do not only belong to the team, but in some cases also with the medals and the finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the Featured in this team is to be elected that she was elected by the other members of the team so that there was anyway a great honour, but to know that my team of team was voted for me and have chosen it to something special for me, added them."</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the villi who belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we come.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as an established athletes, athletes, who want to rise on podiums."</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech as a capitals concerned?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think it was good."</seg>
<seg id="157">"I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, as we have a home World Championship."</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to put on these home support and benefit from it that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere there.</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking the critics on Facebook: get you not a public office if you can't wear the charity of voters.</seg>
<seg id="161">The Father of our country knew something of poor press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it lasted not long until the newspapers made him because of all, from the internal politics up to his political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he shielded in criticism, safe."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not put his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"for in 1783 Washington:" "the freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and stumm we will be guided as the sheep for battles."</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to governor Larry Hogan, who has to work more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogoose's employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union defended him therefore at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the start of the governor dismissed the lawsuit as frivol, and the online comment was full of a backlash with" Na, and? "</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," said many people. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important when it is a guy like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">"this is a Republianic governor in an overwhelming democratic state, which is amazing."</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second bed approval of the 50 Governor of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary Hitzhead.</seg>
<seg id="176">He demonstrated a fixed hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very sent to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with its constituents and playing his haired head to chemotherapy upon his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blockboards of persons who come to the side of the governor - which is a public forum, which is considered to be officially paid by public tax Dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post defended Hoelia speaker of Amelia Chasse the acts of the governor, argued that the blockage of the comments is nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">"but it is too simple, the image of scroll or spammers or hassertive people to use online the whistle schwingen."</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are only real people who speak with their chosen leadership: a teacher, a entrepreneur and a priest, no scroll."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments respectfully, thoughtfully and not profan."</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor cited the Bible in his post and appellioted to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani by Bolike, MD., was not hassertive, but she asked for Hassthbreaking."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I loved polite, that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hassing and other current messages, she wrote in the commentary area of the message" "The Post."</seg>
<seg id="187">"I appreciate this idea even if a number of people perceive the same issue, then they are perceived by some more than such a common collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the employees of the governor as" concentrated spam attack "" would be other probably "" intercede "." "</seg>
<seg id="189">"the Facebook-era makes it easy to get a message by simply, by simply a critics or deleted a negative comment."</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in early times when one had done the same that employees were detrified to collect papers with critical conductors and to burn or protesters, and to sweeping to silence."</seg>
<seg id="191">But just that happens just digital.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public officials which he criticized that it has Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is charged by Twitter-users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question was the last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County Prelast the First Amendment, according to US-District Apostle James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she called a voters from her Facebook-site."</seg>
<seg id="196">"and in Kentucky, Governor received Matt Bein (R) also a visit of the ACLU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so heavy.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington had the time of affordable portos such as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers neglected between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter to his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even at that time Washington was anonymous Troll.</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people, the pseudonyms like" "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius", "wrote all letters to newspapers, the Washingtons decisions made."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions, who criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and the boat trip with Great Britain, according to the historical documents that were collected by the Online Papers of George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not have brought them to silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">Freedom of expression and discourse include the basis of our nation.</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means that to accept.</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others have tried and have failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly I can actually do.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if so, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">"Politico reported that the new Stabilizer of the White House is planning to restrict the information flow on President Trump - including the reports of news media - in hope to keep the boss on a moderate course."</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of Reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Stabilizer of the White House, at his first working day, he introduced a main problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he chooses repaired, bad information that turned into the hands of the president."</seg>
<seg id="1395">"Kelly said the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in letters, because the President would make better decisions if he would receive good information."</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense but others have tried to donate Trump by watching his media staff.</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trumps relationship with television reaches decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV-advertising is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when Candidate Trump was negotiated because of an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of places received," said the former electoral consultant Sam Nunberg in February towards police. "</seg>

<seg id="1403">"we will probably never experience something about the Tweets, the Trump has not sent."</seg>
<seg id="1404">"when his staff made it a few times, anger of worries from him, then their efforts have been worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="1405">But nobody has consistently able to prevent the Trump Controversen.</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem consists of that people in a White House, which continues to compete out of competing parties, always try to present their own agenda by giving Trump material that might be able to promote their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Politico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of consultants, giving the President of strategic reasons to bring about strategic reasons."</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example that was described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump-officials say that Trump can react like a volcano on negative values, especially such with shameful Lectures, and that he will find out to know where these originate."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"this happened at the end of February, when someone took a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet-Provocation, the website of the Internet-Provocation, the website of the Internet-Provocation, who were accustomed to his heaps in Katie Walsh," the spring behind a hurst of Lectures "in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson did permanently burned out from Twitter, or that he has offered no specific evidence or that he criticides in the past and redeem them."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump las the article and started to ask employees about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"Gold macher added that the previous Stabschef Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter," have tried to implement a system to manage and document the Trump. "</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did the folded?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tried three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove to prove to be more effective manager as Priebus, but Trump is still his impulse self, and his consultants are still influenced by influence."</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist emphasises the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employees of the weekly Riodoce normally meet that their plans for reporting about the youngest chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and undisputed drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on this day, in the shadow of her own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was communicated to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-level journalists will discuss what is safer to feel secure: you should take your children with your office, the 2009 goal of an attack with granulates, or they leave at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"safety experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room: opponents, neutralized, alliances."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"you ask the Reporter, names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and pantry."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drugs infants, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspicious to stand on the salary of the government or the map, a catalogue of Crime, which can be dangerous to the chaos of Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no rest from violence, and throughout the land the corpses, are becoming more journalists at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto shall be held in December 2012 and has been under at least seven plote in seven states."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter is its publisher and her inspirator of Riodoce, the co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"his lack will be deeply felt, although its presence is present everywhere - a great photo of Valdez, which shows his midfinger with the word" Justice "," on the façade of the Riodoce building. two Reporter in the three-thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, bear T-shirts that his smiling face with spectacles or his typical Panamahut. "</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss about their shared topics, the trauma, their Alpdreams, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although 2010 a special-government office was established in order to process the cases of journalists, this according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists is conducted only two criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most of the evenings of Morden, which are linked each year with drug and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely placed before dish."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"near Riodoce they still consist of treat the violence of Sinaloa, although they are unbearable and even though the terrain is still more seperate."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information on the murderers, without justice, the meetings for the discussion of the safety of little benefit, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we do not know the Why, misstrate we all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">In the morning of 15 May Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the provincial capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he made it just to ride a few blocks away before his red Toyota COROLLA was raised by two men. he was forced from his car, probably due to the name of the newspaper - who is translated with" twelve "" river "." "</seg>
<seg id="1830">The cry came into his car away and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He made a woman and two adults children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Odours tend to move freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">"but on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence."</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzmans arrests last year and the delivery in the United States in January was Sinaloa to one of the bloodiest powers of the country, as rivalising political groups fight here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"there is nothing that in Sinaloa every day someone can be shot or more people on the road or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-storey mons for drugs, which are larger than many houses for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">"forget for a minute that there is a state of" tranquility "," if only a Kartell will have control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first of all, it was published in February the publication of a interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the mutually cartridges compilations in the war with Guzmans Sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have the sons of sharpened, suspected gangsters purchased each copy of the output when she was delivered to Timetkioske."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second fault was unable to force Valdez, after the confiscation of another paper, which had published the same story to leave the country to its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and its potism is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had so long survived that his friends and colleagues were assumptions that he would still be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">"he was active in 2003 as an experienced reporters for Northeeste as he joined together with five colleagues on the establishment of Riodoce, and 50 US dollars."</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa, it was impossible to operate journalism without stating on the rodowry problem," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1847">"with the time the newspaper served a reputation because of the courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising took place."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"Reporter has been able to publish hard cooperating investigations without fear of censorship, and the reader were captivated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else."</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" for their reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in the persecution of the Mexican drug history, where always she crossed."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave himself up voluntarily that he had fear.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ Award. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trading in Sinaloa" is a way of life "" he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV. "</seg>
<seg id="1854">You must take the task that falls you as a journalist or either you play the dumplers.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"I want not to be asked:" "what have you done so many tothe... why did you not told what went before?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team miss Valdez, the Spaeth who was like a harbor workers, the friend, the generous with hugs and advice, a teacher, the knew how one survived."</seg>
<seg id="1857">You trust his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar towards the office, go and sit down there at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now ask them: was his love for routine be his embarrassment?</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death also has to forced them to ask their own assumptions about how they work best and stay alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they do not like it with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their native rows and landways to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high level of autonomy and self-conservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">His own instincts trust.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it fails, lead to it away."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the hassle is," said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal that "smell is a sense that can be geted... and then is the thing with Javier has happened."</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, apply in Sinaloa no longer - just as in Tamlilipas, VERACRUZ, Guerrero and other states in which a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggelroutes, weak institutions and corrupt government offices."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>

<seg id="1874">"it is months ago, since the reporters have gone into the burns where the drug heads are facto under control."</seg>

<seg id="1883">"for a few months before, the reader would have taken the Kolumne of Valdez as the best informative source of deduction."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"previously we had already knew what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "" El FLACO "because of his slender body."</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"the office of Valdez was devoted to storage space for characters and stickers that are devoted to the Morde of journalists, because the employees have become something they had never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>

<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic, the best preserved fossil is the best preserved fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something that seemed to sit down from the surrounding rock, and decided to watch more accurately."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaces.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years, the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1.100 kg) of heavy strains."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all these hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only kill a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it was slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientists at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="1936">It is considered to be one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs-copies - the Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found that this plant is covered, although he is covered with a armament, and a changing, probably from flesh, send Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the strong spared dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide themselves from robbers, and used a shielding technology, which is used as counter-coating, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have been allowed to mix itself better into its surroundings and serve its enemies, say experts, what it indicates that it has been threatened by larger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of the Nodosaurs took place in May for the first time and is now at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeolers.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and it Borealopelta markwithchelli named after the Museumstechnics Mark Mitchell, one of a team who has spent more than 7.000 hours to cover it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The astonishing preservation of the specimens made it Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of shed and armours via his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the confrontation, a widespread defence method in the animal world, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than their underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the concentrates are common, the results are surprising, because the size of Borealopelta is by far the animals living in animals."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it indicates that the dinosaurs has enough pressure from flesh, dinosaurs was hunted that the evolution was disastrous as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most of contemporary animals, who stand up by shaded, zebras or ghosts - are much smaller and vulnerable than booty, which signalizes that this Nodosaurs was exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong Raubtier behavior on a massive, strongly committed dinosaurs, how dangerous the dinosaurs must have been" "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis organize connections in their scales also indicates that the skin of the dinosaur was red.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to examine the animal on references about his life, including his confestive intestine to find out what it has eaten as its last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaur, when he died, into a river grills and went out into the sea where he sank on the back to the sea."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time Alberta was so warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans probably more widespread than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurs is really remarkable because he is completely covered with preservative skin, but also in three dimensions and retains the original form of the animal retains, said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal is almost exactly the same as in the early rolling time.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you don't need to use a lot of fantasy to reconstruct it. if you just have a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that he is on sleeping."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the crayon time was a time, when huge thermal, meeaters dinosaurs, which arose on two legs, the earth had passed."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, millions of years after Borealopelta, the grounded dinosaurs was hunted by some of his frightened ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this belongs to Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 ft foot (11,5 m) long, six ton of severe monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"the scientists, their latest findings in the journal Current Biology will appear to believe that Borealopelta was scattered after death in the sea, and in the mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum it is the defeated Dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armament, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>

<seg id="2060">"a question came to Ferrell in the mind," do you want to document, or trying to find a story that you can use? "</seg>

<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed, when she saw the finished product for the first time. "</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that it has to give a certain violability at this work and in the disruption of black people.</seg>

<seg id="2077">"she was the person who raised this energy, she said."</seg>
<seg id="2078">"there is no coincidence, although it was at the front front, because in a life on these crosses as a black, gay woman is so much on the game."</seg>

<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping center at the southern side of the pedestrian zone has been outdated since the first presentation of 2009 the population in supporters and opponents.</seg>

<seg id="2108">There are already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">"but you see how many stores are empty here, some for months and years."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since there is not even an ordinary weekend market, it is more important that us at least preserved the market hall."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered here is fresh, is largely offered directly from the producer and is obendlessly inexpensive."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as one sees, the stores are rented in a shopping center only by larger companies, because the dorfers are often not portable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"special, special stores there is almost no more and what else is left, then there will probably be even disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping center with a market hall does not fit together.</seg>

<seg id="2116">"above all, where should the peasant hall during the construction time?"</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old ecdeka would be the solution - even on time when the bit gallery will actually come.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or create the bit bit-gallery already previously to distribute all shops from Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "that will simply not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center, which is empty, no one needs."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real peasant market instead of this gallery."</seg>

<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithmic analysis of DNA that could be extracted by Manning data, and out of the 30 portraits, like somebody could be interpreted with these genomic data - the many ways, as they can be interpreted as well as the intimate determinants of these interpretations - but also for identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already talked about the identification as woman, was condemned in 2013 because of 20 counts, including six verses against the espionage Act, Computer was and theft."</seg>

<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012-project'Stranger Visions.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in this produced the artist of foreigners from forensic Arteaches such as cigarettes, and chewing gum, bringing the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people might look."</seg>

<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully bring that our genome is not about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective them are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work from 2007, trace Memories, is also visible. "</seg>

<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a dedicated room is an page from the above Comic-Novelle."</seg>

<seg id="2592">"the postdoctoral associations in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan taught a kind of immunity who had tolerance as they found that a group of course powers had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was separated, but this did not."</seg>

<seg id="2596">"to understand how the bacteria have to grow on the immune system, the researchers created L. reuteri in a liquid and carried out small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells, which were isolated from mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed on the tolerancillary cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"as the active component was cleaned out of the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of Tryptophan-Metabolism, which is known as an indol-3-lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"when the researchers have duplicated the amount of Tryptophan inside the feed of mice, the number of such cells grew by about 50 percent, but if the pryptophanvalues were halved, sank the number of cells around half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes Barragan explained that people have the same tolerancillful cells such as mice and that most of us L. reuteri in our stomach-intestinal markets.</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known as Tryptophan-side-products from L. reuteri the cells in humans develop as with mice, but Defaults in relation to Tryptophan were found in people with anti-inflammatory disease."</seg>

<seg id="2892">"Christian Weisnder, speaker of the reform" "We are Church" "declared to release from former Regensburger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Dominiellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year's brother of Pope Benedict XVI., an excuse."</seg>
<seg id="2893">"it would be very serving the reputation of the Catholic Church, if Müller and Ratzinger can express their profound needs about their own sub-omissions or their at that time false estimate of the proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the Vatican" "Osservatore Romano", "on the other hand also criticized that during the reporting on violence among Domspatzen (" two dimensions ""). "</seg>
<seg id="2895">"with regard to the grips in Regensburg, there is no one that it would have to be shredded and shameful deeds, but the" degree medial manipulation "," be the "degree medial manipulation", "as the" degree medial manipulation, historians and member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee. "</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit, the Catholic Church as a source of all evil experience, is already part of the day experience and preparing the public opinion that is ready for normal" writes Scaraffia. "</seg>
<seg id="2897">Also Fürstin Gloria by Thurn und Taxis said in an interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk: "you are happy to go on the church and this is a tiffed fat.</seg>
<seg id="2898">"moreover they pointed out that in their youth" blows have been a quite normal pedagogical means "to be with joyful children, as I was one, ready to finish."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"they fuses it unfair, present standards on previous decades, because the world changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with the reports of the abuse of the abuse of cases, the brother Georg Ratzinger often appears."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"totally to Unfairly, the author and historians Michael Hesemann, who translated with Ratzinger the reminder" My brother of Pope "" to be translated into 12 languages). "</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Hesemann, "for all that had nothing to do with him, he evaluated the results of the final report."</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly stands in the 440-seize report that has submitted by the diocese Regensburg with the Enlightan attorney Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of grips, 67 Domspatzen sexually abused. "</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report it is said to Georg Ratzinger, which was active from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg:" "summary, so that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychic violence have been applied."</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially with high emotion of emotion, the stocks could also fall even more fierce for the pupil."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, in contrast to numerous other complains that many victims suffer the general humanity by R. estimated and therefore in numerous cases despite violence even more positive memories with it."</seg>
<seg id="2908">In interview Hesemann, why the Final Report on the abuse of the Missouri dominates by the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger of his opinion. "</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-pages report on the "incidents of violence by the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture of Dominiellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">"to raise many students his" "humanity". ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"for the other he also appears as choleriker and perfectionist, who became more tangible when a domen musically brought a top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate as his bio-graph this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesman: when one reads the trouble and reads all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself quite a question why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all ahead of it."</seg>
<seg id="2914">It is once dedicated to him and he is clearly devoted to each suspicion of the middle or coco-hood during the terrible cases sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Also the violence of violence in the early school is out of its active sphere.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"one can throw him all, too late, or have not taken seriously enough to have taken seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domspatzengzhou, in which he was effective, was conceived by practically all respondents - as literally -" salvation, "" heaven "and" better world. "</seg>
<seg id="2918">"thus also the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger represents an excellent record, describes it as" "warm," "sincere", "" sincere "," "sincere", "" sincere "" and 'understandable, "" was carried out regularly with cakes, biscuits and Bonbons, and' always from grapes from children. "</seg>
<seg id="2919">"merely a minority concerns about his perfectionism and its high emotion, which led even to wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"that he did not only cast with some chairs and cast them on the ground, but also earcheered guys to the hair, or ears, he has already been planted in years ago, deeply regret and apologized for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"said to his salvation, however, we must be said that such education methods in the fragile time, the 1960s and 1970s, were widespread in parents just as with teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeders methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think each of us who was born in 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"also I have experienced this in a worldly school, a state-Gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to the, what actually goes in this report, namely the detective sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the forefront, are the free bagatelles."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"if you ask yourself whether it was not more likely to do with his familiarity and his role as brother of Benedict XVI, that many media has just put it into him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"on the Bavarian pope, many who have never understood it, still unfreeze."</seg>
<seg id="2928">The truth is: the report is discharged Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In connection with the report a lot about the topic of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger in the Final Report as well as some negotiation or co-operation with regard to sexual abuse for the load?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not only the 67 victims of sexually overgrips claimed to have become familiar to the Dominiellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never done myself to talk to my Father or my mother," "said a sufferer substitute for the others," It was all very embarrassing. "</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem with the education of sexually abuse was and is however that most victims should be silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they didn't even know parents and siblings, then definitely not a choral conductor, the nevertheless, a colleague of the perpetrators would have been."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do you rate the Domspatzen students Ratzingers's role in regard to the misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questioned student formulied it so: "in terms of sexual abuse... I see... not yet, in which he would have had the timely findings and have been able to hold the respective offenders."</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I consider it... even for really absurd, accept that there is well... bubbles intervene or clear or even more recently opened, as compared to their parents, dormitory, trust, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"thus, the report comes to the very clear outcome:" "that it was affected in the occurring student and / or its surroundings, could not be confirmed in the context of the examination."</seg>
<seg id="2942">What sexual abuse affects is Georg Ratzinger so unanswered by every co-operation.</seg>
<seg id="2943">"thus, it cannot be discarded to him not to be prevented or brought it to the ad."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to bring its good name to these reflex crimes, as unfortunately it happened in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media a great deal of "violence" to read on the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Dominiellmeister Georg Ratzinger is thrown in the report "away."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Must he live with this forefront?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesman: this is the great problem that in reporting everything was missing and cursed become a huge melange from sexual abuse and violence, and somewhere, in the middle of the inside, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"however, this is precisely the abuse of the report."</seg>
<seg id="2950">"namely is clean separated: between the school and the Gymnasium of Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence, as well as, we say once, other cautions."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report consists of the time since 1945, so also for four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger does not have choral leaders of the Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole terrible test education, the cases, in which lacks of sadistic curators have been narrowed and maligned, opened themselves at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous states have to have."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with whom Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, for he got the boys first on the face, when they were already on the cathedral."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on that was, like most of the witnesses emphasize, the subject of" "primary" "tabatu". ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">"one was just happy to be coming and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even" paradise "states." "</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the Domspatzengouw?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesman: there was already discipline, but just no sadistic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that" many victims occur the general humanity by R. estimated, and therefore in numerous cases despite violence even more positive memories with it. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"thus remains at the most at the most forefront, to have done."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"but despite all efforts, the report was able to define only two periods in which it was reported from the states at the forefront."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time 1970 / 71, when he began to establish itself and was responsible for the occurrence at a school, where he was not real and responsible, (such a witness) was nothing to hear, and then just about 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Shuttered Georg Ratzinger in front of the states consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengzhou, which the report is even reproduced."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in it, he proves that in the early school, the test will continue to be practiced."</seg>
<seg id="2965">"already in the face of the risk of negative press Release, he recommended urgent need."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"this was of course at a time, as a legal clarity, as a test should also be banned in Bavaria too."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, she invented itself in a legal gray area, as everyone of us are still white."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"there was also difficult for him to estimate where the affected might have passed, or dramatized, and where really the permissible border was exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"but you can also not say, he would have always been away."</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is just true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the test penalty was officially completed in Bavaria too."</seg>
<seg id="2972">"Fürstin Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said yes, it may be unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we speak historian to speak of the" Fallstrick of Anachronism "," thus the danger to assess the moral standards. "</seg>
<seg id="2975">The prince of the Princess has already been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but of course, this does not apply to sexual abuse at all times, and not for what was interruped in the early school of resistance and violence to innocent child labour, which goes far beyond that at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all really horrible and I am glad that it will finally be recorded.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time I have to take Georg Ratzinger, because all that had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means for the disciplination and bursting, thus to move back and to the hair, were widely used in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">As physical burying then it has not been banned from it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Which picture of his governor time has Georg Ratzinger for talks with you for the book "My brother of Pope"?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Came the subject of audits as well as language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesman: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, i.e. Pope Benedicts XVI., tells of his perspective, since played the Domspatzen only a secondary role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I am not sure that he led there a stricter Regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but even this must be said once again: without these perfectionism, without the demand unrelated discipline, it would not have been possible to form an institution of puppet, true cultural botanists of Europe and his musical tradition, which went almost twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and Bonbons alone, one makes no great singers and stand before every success, right in which area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">As what kind of people have you experienced Georg Ratzinger during talks about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesman: through the work on the book and in addition, I have experienced Georg Ratzinger really well and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, fundamental, very respectful and hearty people, from which one could not imagine that he could also do slightly from a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I regularly come regularly with how many former Domspatzen still today, 23 years after his emerization, regularly contact to him who visit him - he is almost blind and treat him as a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who are not forgive him until today, that he was once strictly to them, so are clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domspatzen are grateful to him today that he enriched their lives and took the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he always was a good, väterly teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable respect of respect, to which they still look up and to worship them."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again, all that you insates him, are arousal methods that were then on the order of the day."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long ago overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is highly unjust, a man, just because it is prominent and has an even prominent brother to make medial sin-buck."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intent that stands behind it, just too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which was just published, discharged him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the ascend areas, a 93-year-year-old man who has acquired great publishers and perhaps even Germany no man know the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
