Gol@@ fer L@@ anger gets the Sport@@ pyramid
his experiences on the horse are over@@ looked .
at the end of a golf course in South Africa Bernhard L@@ anger with some colleagues a bit of variety with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a first .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden Sport@@ pyramid &quot; for Bernhard L@@ anger
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses went to their holiday , they h@@ unted in the fast Gal@@ op@@ p home to the feed . &quot;
&quot; a kilometer at this pace , I have been afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says L@@ anger . &quot;
and thus the equ@@ estrian career ended up again .
on Saturday Germany was the best Gol@@ fer of all times - 101 tournament - again close to horses .
&quot; he left himself with his family on the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse , he did not f@@ ade away . &quot;
the first time in Aachen and with the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convinc@@ ing .
the German sports@@ men sur@@ pass the man from An@@ hausen as part of a small g@@ ala the Gol@@ den@@ e Sport@@ pyramid .
to the hon@@ ours there is not the sympath@@ etic ath@@ l@@ ete .
&quot; Federal Republic of Germany , sil@@ ber@@ nes Lor@@ eber@@ ries , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has already b@@ bled him .
long is the 18th Award of the Sport@@ pyramid .
in Aachen he met the first prize of Hans Gün@@ ter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; says L@@ anger , &quot; because it is not only awarded for sports success , but also for social engagement . &quot;
for decades the L@@ anger promotes the off@@ spring .
and so he also gave the prize money from 25.@@ 000 Euro .
&quot; with 15 more outstanding ath@@ letes , the two @-@ fold U.S. poles was added to the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of the German Sports . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the excellent include the easi@@ ath@@ l@@ eten Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Sch@@ mitt , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , the Ru@@ ote Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob @-@ driver Mein@@ hard N@@ ests , the Spring@@ oka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the jumping Al@@ win Sch@@ ock@@ em@@ ö@@ hle and pos@@ th@@ um of the hand@@ all Er@@ hard Wonder@@ ful . &quot;
many of these sports leg@@ ends have arrived on Saturday after Aachen .
&quot; after the official part wander@@ ed the illustrations society into the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ az@@ za price ran . &quot;
Bernhard L@@ anger gave a distance to the large animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tru@@ mp@@ s economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and the trade agreement T@@ TP - they want to be both Clinton and Tru@@ mp .
&quot; but un@@ one are the two US presidential elections , but with the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic question . &quot;
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosoph@@ ical difference . &quot;
the role of the state on the role of the state .
Tru@@ mp wants to keep in doubt rather small and war@@ ned before how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton wants to don@@ ate the economy to death and regul@@ ate death .
&quot; in contrast , it would be quite different , claimed Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; he will continue to regul@@ ates Reg@@ ul@@ atory and he makes for a far @-@ reaching control reform with lower wheel@@ ers , strong - for individuals and for companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton is said : the state has certain tasks to fulfil , he has dis@@ advantaged opportunities and needs money . &quot;
&quot; therefore , taxes would raise taxes for the rich , says it . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in the nuts , Tru@@ mp and Clinton is almost protected . &quot;
the democratic candidates even pre@@ mier@@ ed the greatest investment in new jobs since World War II .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policy and are rejected by the state @-@ tran@@ script of the repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; so on Tru@@ mp , so we could get to their internal discussion . &quot;
more clearly are the differences in energy and climate policies .
Tru@@ mp wants to build co@@ le@@ power plants and drive the cohesion of coal in the United States .
&quot; oil @-@ promotion should also be possible in so far protected areas , the Paris climate agreement wants to announce it . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , Clinton wants to expand their investment program with its investment programme : &quot; &quot; a country will create the super@@ power energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it . &quot;
&quot; however , not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the tran@@ sp@@ azi@@ gel trade agreements , they want to do not to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both they want to isol@@ ate the USA from international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs . &quot;
the should then be paid even better , calls for about Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage of 7,@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger strike .
it wants to increase it at 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tru@@ mp is to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must , then he says , he might not be changed . &quot;
but the great discussion of the coming months is likely to develop more likely to develop the tax policy of both camps .
&quot; on the one side , Tru@@ mp is on the one side , who wants to stim@@ ulate the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his cri@@ tics keep him ahead , so that the bud@@ de@@ fic@@ it would only be even bigger . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton wants to ask at least by the rich wants to pay more taxes , and their cri@@ tics are saying , more taxes are not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; every refugees has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence is among women who fle@@ e alone nearly already to everyday life .
if they arrive in Germany they are often traumatic .
a house offers re@@ fu@@ ge .
in a large kitchen four women are sitting .
each has a baby that is at most one year old .
one has laid their little son in the arm .
he stret@@ ched with big eyes curious in the space .
his mother is on top of the table .
until they remember that they are observed .
it smil@@ es short and kis@@ sing the cl@@ one .
the scene acts normal .
until one speaks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; it is a business leader of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social aid offers in Bavaria , and deals with women on the flight . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are refugees .
they live in the Mün@@ ch@@ ner North in one of the few de@@ centralized accommodations for all mature women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs stayed together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Mün@@ ch@@ ner Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe .
&quot; un@@ long ago , she was officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men there is no - also not as visitors .
the exception is a guard against the door .
&quot; it is not ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated to say , every woman who is here , has made here on their flight experiences with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men fle@@ e because of wars , because they are politically persec@@ uted , because they impos@@ e torture or death or because their families will send them as Hop@@ n@@ ung@@ ers to Europe . &quot;
&quot; in women over@@ weig@@ h other reasons for the flight : &quot; &quot; many ste@@ al rise , because they cannot see any other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their homeland they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , sm@@ ass@@ man , sla@@ very or forced stitution . &quot;
this is driving them away .
on the run it goes on .
&quot; that tu@@ g@@ boats for example for a bottle of water is calling for a sexual act , is not rar@@ ity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
and the women are alone ; they are not protected by their families .
&quot; who believe that the end as soon as they anch@@ ors in Germany , ir@@ re , tells us . &quot;
&quot; also here , the women in re@@ fuge@@ e accommodation would often be considered as min@@ der@@ ot@@ ed and worst if ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; this results that about 90 per cent of women who are staying in the north of the Mün@@ ch@@ ner North , they are estimated . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot;
many women were so usual that they don &apos;t say anything .
&quot; or they don &apos;t trust , openly talking about the experience , because the shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; since they often did not help to help , find it more accommodations only for them , asking B@@ ahr . &quot;
in Bavaria the seven Reformation are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
&quot; on the question , whether they w@@ anting by a similar project like in Munich in its jurisdiction . &quot;
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken there is something about governments not .
&quot; also in Sw@@ abi@@ ans alone , women are not separated from himself , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , Press Release of the Government . &quot;
in Ober@@ bay@@ ern - Under@@ - and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken are available in some common under@@ tak@@ ings or own houses only for all the women and their children .
&quot; the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
also the committee &quot; rights of women and gender equality &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men .
&quot; in a study that was published for the committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated . &quot;
l@@ acks the privacy or the men and women are missing , it can lead to a continuous improvement of violence against women . &quot;
&quot; especially the washing rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , stands in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much the women feel of this protective needs , one can take advantage of the cr@@ acy that is available on the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since itself has spoken out that there is , we have a long queue , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
you could easily make a second house .
assistance in dispute : demands for new labour conditions
&quot; Deputy of the assistant &apos;s assistant have called its trade union to be called , new labour measures with respect to a new contract . &quot;
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has demanded its entire Council from the beginning of September .
&quot; J@@ DC said that there was Minister of Ministers , on the wor@@ ries of the contract . &quot;
assistance systems and medical inst@@ inc@@ u@@ dents have been adjusted in July on the rejection of a contract which has been agreed with the BM@@ A .
&quot; he was rejected by 58 % of its members , which have coordinated among the elections . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the members , who was published on Thursday evening on Twitter , said the President of J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court that the government has remained &quot; persist@@ ent peac@@ efully . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; given the J@@ DC Board of Directors to fully reject the proposed new contract with the proposed new contract . &quot;
&quot; as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board adopted a formal application to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to start a relaxing program of escal@@ ating labour measures , the beginning of September begins . &quot;
&quot; the disputes led to that assistant of this year Six@@ sm@@ al sent@@ ences , the first overall emer@@ gen@@ cies in the history of the NH@@ S . &quot;
&quot; the manager of BM@@ A Assistance in Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came after the election to reject the agreed contract conditions , which were recommended by the BM@@ A . &quot;
&quot; he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings , who had still thought before the vote through 54.@@ 000 assistance centres and medical inst@@ inc@@ u@@ dents , with that the contract should be advant@@ age@@ ous and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the voting , the Health Minister Jer@@ em@@ y Hunt , that the contract for doctors in England would be forced to be introduced . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of out@@ sider &quot; ?
it was a ges@@ ture that ended up a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce their hands and pro@@ claim an official end of eight months to pro@@ claimed the war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish backl@@ ash in the gold @-@ based hall of St. Pet@@ ers@@ burger Pal@@ ast@@ es in receiving , I cannot wo@@ und@@ ing up the penetration that Ankara is going to reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand@@ leb@@ ar , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Put@@ t smil@@ es , nar@@ row@@ ly and made hardly heat out , even for its back@@ ing conditions . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an , on the other hand spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot;
I could not count it anymore .
&quot; he also spoke that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but even better . &quot;
&quot; on the next day a newspaper , that Erd@@ og@@ an would have heard that it would never be anything else . &quot;
to me his enthusi@@ asts seemed to indicate the opposite .
&quot; but one of Putin showed more radi@@ ant , sustainable cur@@ ators showed that the state of Russia had nothing forgotten . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first what he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory report : the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border with Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction at the time was w@@ ut@@ ent@@ bran@@ ns .
Putin war@@ ned and acc@@ used Ankara to succeed in the back .
&quot; it was even bigger , since it was committed by a ver@@ itable friend . &quot;
Vet@@ r@@ ys will be re @-@ build once more difficult if not even impossible .
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the state @-@ controlled media led a fier@@ ce , unlimited attack on Ankara . &quot;
&quot; at once , it seemed to be the Tur@@ ks for all the gu@@ ilt . &quot;
&quot; in serious , the acc@@ us@@ ations of equal officers , that Erdo@@ ğ@@ an has benef@@ ited its own family from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria , which could be controlled by the so @-@ called Islam@@ ist state . &quot;
he has this veh@@ ement .
&quot; but in St.@@ Petersburg , the official message was that it is time to look forward . &quot;
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received from the President Erd@@ og@@ an the sorry that he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia was able to book a kind of victory .
for Ankara the advantages of a cease @-@ fire falls clearly on hand .
&quot; Erd@@ og@@ an needs first and foremost all friends who he can get , after spending the last month at a weak@@ ened state of almost his ministry . &quot;
repeti@@ tive terror@@ ist attacks on Turkey have also sh@@ aken them .
but there are also economic moti@@ ves .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey - especially the ban on charter flights that each year usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast .
the number is gone by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , travel agencies and charter companies will be facilit@@ ated if the flights will be restored . &quot;
you are counting on a delay of inc@@ lin@@ al inc@@ lin@@ m to the Mediterranean .
&quot; this week pro@@ gn@@ os@@ tiz@@ ers the state of watching , fruit and vegetables , as soon as the Turkish agricultural agriculture will be returned . &quot;
&quot; a report in V@@ ed@@ em@@ ost@@ i form@@ uli@@ ed it : &quot; tourists there long , tom@@ atoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry in the West since its reaction to the tried fe@@ eds to be seen as a weak answer .
&quot; to this end , the continued Gro@@ ll on the Schn@@ eck@@ ent@@ emp@@ o of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ vot@@ al to move out of the cool mood and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot;
&quot; the Russian state ef won in Ankara with security a bonus , that he sought after the sought @-@ up support for the chosen state organs . &quot;
this is well as well as a matter of course in Moscow it has a profound fear of reg@@ im@@ uth .
&quot; the summit meeting in this charming palace at the sea made it both Russia and Turkey , one as it was once described as a analy@@ st &quot; &quot; alliance of out@@ sider &quot; , &quot; the alliance of out@@ sider &quot; &quot; to be treated and bad@@ ly treated and now . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two still big differences . &quot;
&quot; the greatest difference is Syria , where Moscow had recently announced the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey could support Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it could be significant , that after almost three hours of the first meeting they said both President on the press conference that they could not have been striped . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the President of Turkey exp@@ elled on a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emph@@ asi@@ ze this . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on which a common den@@ omin@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open enemies , and given the pot@@ entials for a perfect dis@@ asters as the NATO member of Turkey the Russian struggle , it is certainly better that the two heads of state will at least another talk . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland &apos;s no longer available
the R@@ BS brand is to be reduced to a back@@ office according to the prot@@ ector of the Bank and more to a back@@ office .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside of Scotland .
Ros@@ s Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland with that the brand were connected with the global ambi@@ tions of the Bank .
the bank has since been dis@@ soci@@ ated since she had to be almost k@@ oll@@ ed and saved almost eight years ago .
&quot; in this time bran@@ ded &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; is used to protect other end @-@ consumer brands . &quot;
they supported international sport with millions of pounds to sponsorship , from the Six Nations Rugby to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Murray . &quot;
but now she decided to put more national marks into the focus .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales every RS@@ B References , the de@@ centr@@ alised head@@ quar@@ tered and the stock exchange at Nat@@ Western changes . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other , smaller brands for the private customer business , which will be more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in Inver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand will become one of our investors brand , as well as the brand , among which our employees will be busy since we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; as the bank itself has become a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; I say that we have no global goals , but local goals . &quot;
each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities for something completely different and our employees are working with the customers .
&quot; R@@ BS has already said that it will not lead his Six Nations sponsorship , and that it will increase the per@@ cep@@ tiveness of the various brands in its sport sponsor@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; it is time for us to develop themselves to the bank of the brands , because as we focus on inside ( we are asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; said the alleg@@ edly . &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ n@@ ically three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have chosen these marks .
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , think I will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can restore these marks again , therefore I think that the time has come . &quot;

&quot; I am very happy about that it happened at New@@ market , because I am standing 30 years ago . &quot;
&quot; it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it is a ban@@ aler Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am easier and very mod@@ est .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the ju@@ bel over the victory in Pre@@ dil@@ ection to win the victory

&quot; L@@ ester pig@@ e@@ ester , the nin@@ th @-@ day Der@@ by@@ winner had 4,@@ 493 &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of modern@@ ity and there is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that only a few minutes before him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical int@@ ell@@ ect that diff@@ ers it from the other in the weight @-@ control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic amb@@ assador for race , his enthusi@@ asts and char@@ isma has been enthusiastic for this sport for years . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie in a few weeks ago at Ep@@ s@@ om , that he had already fet@@ ched gains profits if he would not only be a weekend and grand@@ parents ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has already worked for nearly 30 years of winning players .
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount

Russian Putin moist@@ ur@@ izes Stab@@ ili@@ zer Serge@@ i Iv@@ ano@@ v
the Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expected his rod Serge@@ i Iv@@ ano@@ v .
Iv@@ ano@@ v was many years part of the dedicated confidence created by Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed to the special representative for environmental and transport matters .
&quot; in an opinion of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is that Putin has arranged without giving reasons &quot; &quot; the dism@@ is@@ sal of I@@ van@@ ova from its duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been a substitute for 2012 I@@ van@@ ova , was appointed to his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at . &quot;
1972 born in the Est@@ onian capital of Tallinn he made his conclusion on the renowned state of the Moscow Department of International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in Tokyo .
&quot; on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin it is ( in Russian ) , that he later was later the manager and the leaders of the government . &quot;
&quot; about his appointment he said to Putin , &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot;
I think that it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as a state of law regarding law@@ lessness and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin shared the Russian TV stations on Friday with that Iv@@ ano@@ v asked to leave his post and advised V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
see the smil@@ es faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious top .
&quot; Serge@@ i Iv@@ ano@@ v was a long time in one of the most common confidential Vladimir Putin , and works as he is working for the Soviet intelligence , the K@@ GB . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he was one of the most powerful men of the country . &quot;
&quot; during a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on TV , they claimed both men that the Stab@@ ili@@ zer can be returned to your own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the smil@@ es for the cameras , here are only a few of it - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
here is the result of a kind of power struggles ?
this knows no one at the moment .
&quot; but the official argument - that a man who was once ordered as a potential president , the Russian environmental policy would lead to great skep@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in his comments to Putin , the Iv@@ ano@@ v website , &quot; &quot; Iv@@ ano@@ v &quot; &quot; it is true that I asked you early 2012 in a conversation with me this very complicated post - one could almost say - compl@@ ain job for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been doing for four years and eight months of chairman of the Russian presidential administration . &quot;
Iv@@ ano@@ v took the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Minister and Defence Minister .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and such a former member of the State Security Council K@@ GB .

Queens@@ ferry Cros@@ sing : bridge now with Fi@@ fe connected
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion in the project should be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the Nord@@ deck by the Queens@@ ferry Cross@@ ings with the via@@ duc@@ t - which means that the bridge is now connected with Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four verses of &quot; &quot; ceiling &quot; &quot; which approach to each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
the bridge @-@ section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 met@@ re long and weighs 30.@@ 000 tons .
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20.000 tons of concrete as well as 46 boxes . &quot;
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion in the project should be completed by May 2017 . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Kei@@ th Brown , the construction site was a visit and was one of the first that went away from the country to the bridge . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; this is a historical and symbo@@ lic moment when building the Queens@@ ferry Cross@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; we are all witnesses of a engineer with more than 30.@@ 000 tons of concrete and steel , which were used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the sl@@ ing between the via@@ duc@@ t and the Br@@ ück@@ er is a holy activity , which require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , almost 79 % of the whole Br@@ ück@@ er at its place and the last section of Dec@@ ks gets a Bet@@ ong@@ uss for Deck , which means that the whole Deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to his place . &quot;
Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone in each brid@@ ging project . &quot;
in this fantastic project the cl@@ asp is setting forward @-@ looking and deep @-@ building .
&quot; after installation of the last road cover and its connection , with the expansion of the north tur@@ m@@ deck , we had to close the existing gap on the north or land . &quot;
this was reached by divi@@ ding the northern Z@@ ub@@ ring@@ er@@ bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very hot activity .
&quot; massive , since the via@@ duc@@ t 222 meters long is , approximately 6@@ ,000 tons weighs and had to be drawn up approximately 3 % to the top . &quot;
&quot; kel , since the toler@@ ances , on which the team works , tiny were - on each side it pra@@ ys only a few milli@@ meters . &quot;
fortunately everything went very well .

the police could take the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; during the 50 @-@ year , the clothing of his ex @-@ friend destroyed , he called his mother . &quot;
this al@@ arm@@ oured dar@@ ge of his sister .
together with their li@@ tig@@ ate the 45 @-@ year they wanted to so@@ ak their brother .
but she could not move it to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her life .
on the street she met the ex @-@ li@@ fel@@ ine man .

who builds a budget cheap apartments ?
the SPD and founder of my : investors should be much stronger than the duty of the future .
how does one react to the bad news that will lose almost 1300 apartments in the next few years ?
the SPD is propos@@ ing to the next meeting . &quot;
but dispute is program@@ med .
first and foremost it is about the question : who should actually build the favorable apartments ?
a regulation is missing .
&quot; SPD fac@@ ilitation of Christoph Brat@@ mann said , &quot; &quot; we are committed to the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build up to urban areas in future , need to be 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the cheap apartments can also be found in the stock . &quot;
&quot; however , the great armed point in the city hall was however , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; how does one go with investors who want to build on private areas ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors in such areas at least 10 percent , but as 20 percent of the housing building as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new urban housing program , which will cost millions of cost and will be financed and will be financed to incentives for incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the political groups . &quot;
CD@@ U wants to make investors as a few rules as possible .
the left wants to be hardness for investors .
&quot; regardless of whose , Brat@@ mann , a shar@@ pen@@ ing of the situation on the market place . &quot;
&quot; the action concept is implemented , which will ensure additional tasks in the management management . &quot;
more staff will be needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the experts .
&quot; yet , the program is not entirely available : for the approximately 1260 new apartments , which should be built . &quot;
&quot; but as it is the loss of further around 1300 cheap apartments , whose promotion will be running in the next few years ? &quot;
alone to the year 2020 it will be 500 apartments .
&quot; to prevent this , the plan@@ ab@@ oli@@ tic spok@@ es@@ person Nicole Palm , should now be rede@@ emed from the city . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the apartments would have to be thought to bring apartments back to the price . &quot;
this is possible in the west town .
at one stroke will solve the problem .
for in the west city go for the year fri@@ ght@@ ening dead@@ lines .
&quot; around 1800 apartments , one could get back to the price list for cheap apartments . &quot;
only : this is the owner that the accomodation is not .
&quot; for the number of social housing in the west city , it will increase dramatically from the goal of the so @-@ called flow . &quot;
a concentration of social weak in just a few blocks it should no longer be giving .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will be a movement in discussion .
&quot; leader of Hol@@ ger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke said , &quot; for a wide majority must be the CD@@ U with the boat . &quot;
&quot; indeed , I have concentrated on more construction sites for family dwell@@ ings . &quot;
but what does not mean that not yet a compromise can be found .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunting for health and happiness that worth it &quot;
it is fascinating to watch how the world is changing .
&quot; that teenage children and child has no longer go outside , but rather prefer to spend their free time , on scre@@ ens , was charged in the last decade of many . &quot;
&quot; at Pok@@ em@@ on Go , it is about to get people from the sofa and to be active . &quot;
&quot; the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and last@@ ly limited to smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not close together . &quot;
&quot; I noticed me of course at the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that were created on the characters , first created for video games in the 1990s ( later this creates a sign series , game cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; how many phenomena of pop culture is the interest in the U.S. release of the game in the U.S. , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July . &quot;
market launch in other countries has been post@@ pon@@ ed by the massive demand that the server over@@ loaded .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go more users as T@@ inder and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , the players going out with their smartphone outside and search for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons , which are track@@ ed with a GPS as soon as they were found once , &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the phone ) or &quot; &quot; imprison@@ ed &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game when they had still younger , closed down the tooth and sp@@ rang for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that returns the &quot; average &quot; person every day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ og@@ ram , an app for Apple Watch , the 35.@@ 000 users , divided the Washington Post recently with that within two days following the market launch of the game , the number of subsequent fol@@ ds who exercise every day 30 minutes , ranging from 45 percent to 53 per cent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays out of which Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it merely sees the raw data for performance au@@ ction .
&quot; many public educational campaigns to health , people want to take &quot; &quot; away from the sofa &quot; &quot; to come &quot; &quot; from the sofa to come &quot; &quot; and &quot; every day actively to be &quot; silent on pig@@ eon ears , because many public messages are boring and coming from people coming . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the meaning of sport can not be evaluated . &quot;
&quot; who regularly drives sports , reduces its chances to get cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical exercise helps with weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of advantages that is too long to guide them here . &quot;
but the wonder@@ full of Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open that fun is fun .
&quot; thus three pillars of health covers - movement , fresh air and sunshine and fun . &quot;
some people close to the hunt even new friend@@ ships .
&quot; as always there is also m@@ hur@@ ry game , who always have to compl@@ ain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could run against a door . &quot;
what is it ?
it has a break@@ through .
&quot; even if Smartphone @-@ Apps such as Fit@@ bit were able to follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to practice sports , as it does this game . &quot;
the New will lose its charm and the use will be cont@@ acted with the time .
&quot; however , because of poker &apos;s success , there will be more games to un@@ ite apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world and can help many people on hunting , active , f@@ itter and health@@ ier . &quot;

the 19 @-@ year @-@ year American Tur@@ ner@@ in er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday to the multi @-@ mar@@ gins and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world from all eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
&quot; their overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly in front of the silver med@@ alli@@ sts and &quot; &quot; Final Five &quot; &quot; team sc@@ ans A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man and the Russian bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ a@@ ill@@ en@@ act@@ ress Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;

&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual Americ@@ an@@ erin , who wins a multi @-@ mar@@ gins and a total of the fifth , while they consoli@@ date their reputation , the best of their generation or even at all . &quot;
it broke down in t@@ ears than their end result and found their long journey at this moment .
&quot; this success puts them in the same le@@ ague like unique ath@@ letes , such as Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps , brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es domin@@ ates the last three years of their ath@@ letes , 15 World Championship med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - including an amazing exercises that the Olympi@@ ast@@ eg@@ ress from 1984 Mary Lou bail@@ on from her said that she is the best Tur@@ ner@@ ine that I have ever seen . &quot;
&quot; there was expecting her last examination in Brazil , a competition which went not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of ath@@ letes , but rather between her and a burden @-@ dimensional expectations . &quot;
&quot; not with a hand@@ ful gold back to the family in Spring , Texas will return , would be considered as disappointment . &quot;

&quot; although , Bil@@ es existed before their long path to the top , never to have the future planned , this is not really true . &quot;
part of its bott@@ oms - which contain its typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is adapted to Latin American music that would have a home on the street outside of the Olymp@@ ena in Rio .
this is not a coinci@@ dence .
&quot; this girl who has been adopted by their grand@@ parents as a small child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school cur@@ se in the gym , was trained in Bo@@ or@@ man , became an force . &quot;

mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ zep@@ hal@@ ie : &quot; it becomes better &quot;
&quot; as most 6 @-@ year @-@ old love Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ uto the S@@ ingen , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but as the least of his retirement has Ed@@ mund micro@@ zep@@ hal@@ ie , the result of a genetic disorder , about who knew his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ uto during their pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he came home for the first time , my first thought I did not . &quot;
I don &apos;t know that .
I did not let myself go .
&quot; what is not true at all -- of course , one has left itself on it , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; her husband and her was told that Ed@@ mund they may never be seen under circumstances , and that he may not even survive . &quot;
some doctors even went so far that they lau@@ ght@@ ened him to institution@@ alize it .
&quot; my first answer was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &quot; &quot; declared Pic@@ ci@@ uto . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of a housing .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor scrat@@ ched up to his third year and he can still not speak .
but it slowly makes progress .
he can run with support and cycling .
he also loves it to play with his two brothers and sing .
Elizabeth is showing the character language that Ed@@ mund for &quot; Please tell me something about . &quot;
&quot; we bring him character with , &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ uto CB@@ S News . &quot;
but there is no typical character language -- tells her . Ed@@ mund has changed a few characters alone .
&quot; micro@@ zep@@ hal@@ ie has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund , as well as infections with viruses such as mas@@ cot or the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy . &quot;
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it &apos;s still too early to say how it will affect the life of the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ uto remember the emotional price of an un@@ aware future .
I asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they still don &apos;t know it yet .
&quot; I have been asked for a long time after pro@@ gn@@ osis because I don &apos;t wait , that they can really say me someone . &quot;
&quot; but Pic@@ ci@@ uto has a hop@@ eful advice for mot@@ hers , with birth damage caused by Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus . &quot;
it is better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .

the grand@@ parents of the boys identified him for CB@@ S Philadelphia as Mah@@ ar@@ aja Brown .
&quot; the grand@@ parents gave to that brown were dis@@ counted , including in the L@@ amp , leg , arm and belly , but that he was with his transport into hospital in consciousness . &quot;
&quot; he has done a lot , his small body was pier@@ ced by balls , shared his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z is transm@@ itter with . &quot;
I cannot believe that .
the state of the boy was critical in a hospital as critical and he had to under@@ go several operations .
the family of the boys met the transm@@ itter that he is expected to be back .
he should have the first class to start in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
&quot; likewise , three men were born : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year old . &quot;
one of the 29 years old men is in critical state ; the other two victims are according to the CB@@ S Philadelphia in stable condition .
&quot; the boy was placed on the front of a car along with the 29 @-@ year old , which is located in a critical state , covers the transm@@ itter . &quot;
&quot; the other two victims did not find themselves in the car and the police , just whether under one of the last men of the perpet@@ rators could be found . &quot;
medi@@ ator shared CB@@ S Philadelphia with that it seems to be a cruci@@ ally between several sho@@ cks .
&quot; pat@@ ron@@ age for storm @-@ dres@@ sed , which were persec@@ uted to various assault , over@@ lap the Tat@@ ort . &quot;
it seems that this was clearly tra@@ ded to an ongoing struggle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the walk@@ way , found himself . &quot;
&quot; so it seems to have several armed fighters here , which were very active involved , shared police shows Anthony G@@ inal@@ di the police in Philadelphia to the sender . &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles met in the area .
&quot; there came to no feast , and the police are currently checked according to the surveillance video . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ year girl met by a cross @-@ bed at the arm , when she played before their house in the residential area of the West Oak Lane . &quot;
she re@@ covered up and the police still looking for a susp@@ ect .
why we need Sim@@ one to Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I found myself among the women &apos;s olymp@@ ics in Tur@@ n and that is more than one reason .
&quot; first , I have since 1984 at every summer olymp@@ i@@ ade and the USA were never so dominant . &quot;
&quot; and secondly : this team has three tur@@ ner@@ es , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Dou@@ glas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ de@@ z , inspiring for many young girls of other skin colour . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man , the J@@ ü@@ din is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the cath@@ eter is , makes every proud . &quot;
this team is finally reflected in the USA .
it has paved the black and his@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport art .
in the last four years the number one under the female tower is a A@@ fr@@ o @-@ american .
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games Gab@@ on Dou@@ glas was a surprising Olympi@@ ag@@ ew@@ inner and the Americas .
&quot; now the world was able to be witness of the incredible performance of the three World Championship in Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Dou@@ glas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ de@@ z , as they wa@@ ited un@@ expected , but master@@ ful G@@ ym@@ atic routines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Sim@@ one was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual Americ@@ anism , which won in an individual multi@@ channel event for women Gold . &quot;
team member A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man won Silver .
&quot; we are experiencing the tip of this sport , but we do not see turn@@ around in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to create it into the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; last Five &quot; because the next Olympi@@ ad will have only four tur@@ ers in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality looks so that Tur@@ n is a expensive sports and g@@ ymn@@ ast primarily in private sports , which will cost for training , furniture , competition and hotel reservation ( for the coach and their tur@@ ner and families ) . the list can be continued . &quot;
the majority of these bus@@ hes lie in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can support business .
in these verses the Tur@@ ner get her whole training and that is a expensive and long @-@ term commitment to families .
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ de@@ z , have both their ath@@ letes trained since they started with the turn . &quot;
&quot; we have to be inspired to the con@@ greg@@ ations of countless , young girls that are inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an im@@ bar@@ er and easier accessible turn@@ tables . &quot;
I was founded my Turn@@ son of 20 years .
&quot; at my events we have offered free and affordable turbines in Harlem for over 15.@@ 000 urban youth ( mainly black and his@@ pan@@ ic ) offered and national and international winners . &quot;
&quot; in September we will expand to Det@@ roit ( my hom@@ et@@ own ) exp@@ ands to offer the youth high @-@ quality Tur@@ ns , which will earn the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic sport art . &quot;
&quot; turn develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determin@@ at@@ eness for the spirit . &quot;
this combination provides life @-@ long benefits for health and educational and professional success .
&quot; it is the inspiration of this team , the thousands of young girls bring to interest to the Tur@@ ns and that is great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; &quot; thanks to the Hol@@ en of the Olympic team and thank you , barrel you so many young girls with different back@@ grounds to start their way to start healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistance I would like to organize another strike after they have rejected Jer@@ em@@ y H@@ unts suggestion
&quot; the ministers had dec@@ lining the dispute over the changes through acceptance of a reform@@ ist contract with the functioning of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37.@@ 000 assistant practition@@ ers who are looking at a election away . &quot;
&quot; in July , Hunt plans had un@@ v@@ eil@@ ed to introduce the contract to the contract and said that the NH@@ S could be harmful in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and any further delay for employees and patients would be harmful . &quot;
&quot; the first assist@@ ence should receive a new contract , the changes to night@@ - and weekend work includes to improve care of un@@ fold movements . &quot;

&quot; at only eight weeks , which still remain with the first group of doctors under the new contract , you need to be made progress and the time is running . &quot;
efforts by the BM@@ A to resol@@ ving disputes arising from the government to participate in the government on resist@@ ances and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
&quot; this happened of a promise , the Jer@@ em@@ y Hunt will last only last month to it that his door would always be asto@@ und@@ ing . &quot;
Jer@@ em@@ y Hunt must now act now to lift the condition and concerns the assistance of assistance .
&quot; should he not do this , so they have made the wiz@@ ard made clearly that they are ready to perform further work@@ stations . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw an essay of nearly 13@@ ,000 routines and 100.000 dead@@ lines before , since the nur@@ sery and specialists were included in order to give physi@@ cians on the strings . &quot;
the ministers had dec@@ lining the dispute over the changes through an as@@ sumption of the reform@@ ist contract with the functioning of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the BM@@ A wants to become a better week @-@ out for the 54.@@ 000 assist@@ ence , which are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of the NH@@ S staff , called for assistance to stop the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; working conditions do not reach anything of only little , but already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare patients , toil@@ ers and their families only wor@@ ries , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; during the last two months , we talked to the Committee of Assist@@ enz@@ hou , and with the health Department and other minist@@ ries , positive on concerns about the hand @-@ hand and the wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; employers hop@@ ed that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as audi@@ ting , flexibility at training , additional training for those who were looking for training , continuing education , training and health Department regarding the observ@@ ance of agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;

the ger@@ inn@@ erin medicine T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeti@@ tive heart inf@@ ants for people with a her@@ edit@@ ary disease .
&quot; the medication is already applied for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of a stroke if or another heart attack . &quot;

&quot; some 140,000 people suffer a heart attack and a quarter of it suffer a further heart attack or a stroke . &quot;
heart inf@@ ants and stroke will be caused by inv@@ aders of fatty material in the ar@@ ter@@ ial walls .

culture of Political Cor@@ di@@ ness makes it possible to thri@@ ve in Muslim areas
the former may@@ or of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was last year on the release of a governmental report due to corruption from the office
a culture of the Political Cor@@ di@@ ness has led to that far @-@ common elect@@ oral election in Muslim communities are often ignored like a crus@@ her government report today .
&quot; the former head of the Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es acc@@ esses verbal the police , elect@@ or@@ atory and Rath@@ ouses to do evidence of elect@@ oral abuse on eth@@ n@@ ursing and religion . &quot;
&quot; the former Minister of Integration and Commun@@ al government , which is now a corpor@@ al cor@@ rupt from religious moti@@ fs so bad , that the police should be allowed to adjust shut @-@ off @-@ bands outside of elect@@ oral cast@@ ors to protect mig@@ rant voters . &quot;
he recommen@@ ds that voters should lead a reference to prove to prove its identity .
at present a voters must merely name its name and address .
&quot; the report propos@@ es , not dist@@ ort@@ ed ink to the finger of a person when they vote their choices to prevent somebody will elect twice . &quot;
W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lowers should get more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he calls that the press should have more access to common documents and decisions of not official com@@ modities or working groups .
&quot; this is not only against voting , but also the municipal government before the broader cor@@ rup@@ tions and financial culture culture , which goes with it , he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower of Ham@@ lets to be arranged in the east of London .
&quot; last year , a special Tribunal decided that the am@@ us@@ ement Mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was decided after an Lit@@ an@@ ei to cor@@ rupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the court was that Rah@@ man had rejected the religious feelings of his Muslim community , &quot; and that he had brought his cri@@ tics with rac@@ is@@ sm@@ us@@ - and Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bi@@ en@@ umer@@ ations to silence . &quot;
&quot; Rah@@ man should , &quot; &quot; his campaign is based on the basis that it was the political duty of Muslims , be to vote him . &quot;
&quot; up to 300 voices were either undoubtedly or the result of an im@@ itation , which sel@@ ects a person than anyone else . &quot;
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence throughout the country of evidence .
he expressed himself in particular al@@ arm@@ ing to frau@@ dul@@ ent Brief@@ ing - with the elderly members of the Muslim Community pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
&quot; Sir Eric , formed , made several recommendations in order to hide the elect@@ oral system , including the filling out of it to prove the identity . &quot;
&quot; in his report it says : &quot; &quot; as proof has been proven that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been practic@@ ed , especially women and young people to choose according to the Will of the Elder , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ic or ban@@ glad@@ ical background . &quot;
&quot; there was concerns that ... government institutions have such behaviour due to &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; over@@ sensitivity regarding the eth@@ nie and religion were ignored . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric said 50 recommendations made to clean the system , including the ban that political acti@@ vi@@ sts are able to edit &quot; &quot; elect@@ rom@@ echan@@ ical &quot; &quot; to stop &quot; &quot; elect@@ rom@@ echan@@ ical &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is drawn by Ther@@ esa May , also calls for harder registration tests to prevent the voting directory to Im@@ mig@@ r@@ ational and welfare purposes . &quot;
options to consider voters in front of the choice after your credit card .
&quot; not dist@@ ort@@ ed ink on the finger of a person , as soon as they gave their voice to avoid that anyone chosen twice . &quot;
systematic re@@ ex@@ ams about the nation@@ ality of a person to ensure that they are either justified .
a three @-@ year limit for requests to an automatic stamp .
ban that political acti@@ vi@@ sts are full brief@@ ing and envel@@ op of letters .
the police give powers to set up shut @-@ off to the leg@@ gy@@ ms .
a legislative change that facilit@@ ates a acc@@ us@@ ation for in@@ tim@@ id@@ ation in accordance with the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( Volks@@ isl@@ ative Act 1983 ) .
photographers in elect@@ rom@@ echan@@ ical in the elect@@ rom@@ echan@@ ics .
requirement that only English can be used in the elect@@ rom@@ echan@@ ics ( except with the exception of Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training in order to ensure that the employees will rule the rule alone into the elect@@ oral interior .
&quot; Sir Eric falls on the Metro@@ politan Police and finds it &apos; amazing , that after the Tower Ham@@ acas case has not been completed . &quot;
&quot; the elect@@ oral court has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his dep@@ uty on due to an Lit@@ an@@ ei to cor@@ rupt and illegal practices than unt@@ ary , &quot; said he said . &quot;
he was guil@@ ty due to a number of reasons for suffici@@ ency - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings - guil@@ ty .
he also cri@@ tici@@ zes the effective &quot; waste @-@ controlled &quot; of the elect@@ oral departments of the Rath@@ houses .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the judi@@ sur@@ part in Tower Ham@@ lets from last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country bears as the mother of the parli@@ aments a st@@ ol@@ ous patri@@ mon@@ y , but the wor@@ rying and spread of some governmental authorities threat@@ ens this good reputation . &quot;
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ double @-@ predec@@ essors and other famous Doppel@@ gänger of Olympi@@ as in Rio
fans of the Olympi@@ ad 2016 in Rio are this week over the French Rad@@ sport in Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Prev@@ ot out of edge and band that proved to be an impressive double @-@ predec@@ essor in the heart of Cambridge .
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year Olympi@@ oni@@ kin is far from this summer by far not the only way to overcome gold , who has its own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not , if you may believe social media faith . &quot;
&quot; to honor the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces , which is at the time on our scre@@ ens , FE@@ MA@@ IL created a lists of Olympi@@ ans , which can be more than just a certain simil@@ arity with the land of the most famous . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ unters and the wolf : team member of the U.S. team in Archery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio &quot;
&quot; except K@@ ates double @-@ predec@@ essor on the rad@@ ar track , many people are on the internet towards how a certain arch@@ ery of the Zw@@ illing of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio could be . &quot;
&quot; the team member of the U.S. team in Archery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has created a crash on Twitter after pictures , on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ secret@@ ly similar . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the bow@@ gu@@ ards got the mad@@ ness in the social media with and gave him to hear that he has already been hearing since his childhood he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I myself don &apos;t see large simil@@ arity with the exception of the facial hair , &quot; shared Bra@@ dy of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good@@ bye guy , so f@@ asse I will probably do that as comp@@ liments . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly add more to the center : the simil@@ arity between the British W@@ eit@@ jum@@ pers Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian Tur@@ ner@@ in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with its great , expres@@ sive eyes is supposed to go through a double @-@ predec@@ essor for the Cub@@ an American singer of Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
and in the swimming pool the South African bath@@ ers Cameron van der Burg@@ h has been compared with the g@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison .

another sustained comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett who has been similar to severe ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
&quot; the Russian Silber@@ med@@ a@@ ill@@ ary wi@@ m@@ mer@@ in Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova points more than just the sun @-@ sti@@ pul@@ ated skin and hum@@ ane hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ Cor@@ d on , during the Americans Na@@ than Adrian von fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : football Hop@@ e Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jenni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial shape and eyes &quot;
not the one : a Twitter @-@ user was very happy about that others are also fallen apart .
theory put into the space : according to this user there is for the simil@@ arity of the couple perhaps a reason
&quot; a Twitter @-@ User@@ in explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hop@@ e Solo and Jenni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;

buyer in Pri@@ mark emp@@ athy over wife who tried in the midst of business sh@@ am@@ less under@@ wear
&quot; the buyers did not know where they should h@@ ins@@ ing , when a woman pul@@ led her clothes in the midst of a pri@@ mark to try under@@ pants . &quot;
&quot; to li@@ fy the situation as they saw it , she moved them and put them back into the shelf . &quot;
they continued and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
&quot; the Pri@@ mark shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , in which the woman tried the under@@ pants before they put them back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ d@@ son , who had tried at the same time in business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the under@@ wear , &quot; they left again and buy the shop without purchase anything . &quot;
she said : &quot; people could not believe what they saw . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the sale standing , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the Aus@@ lage , moved their own bus@@ h@@ osis and pants and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a somewhat disc@@ rete place to do it - it just stood there , fre@@ ch like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; each star@@ r@@ te , when she moved back again , which you obviously have not fallen , since they put them back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; she repeti@@ tive the same with three other under@@ pants before they finally decided that you have nothing to come back , and went down . &quot;
she didn &apos;t it any disturb@@ ing that they observed someone - or about the person who would buy the under@@ pants under circumstances which she tried to be tried .
&quot; Mrs. Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; how to think that someone would have under@@ pants with home , who had a different person and that was not wash@@ ed . &quot;
the inci@@ dent occurred on Tuesday in the morning .
&quot; Mrs. Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; as I got , the staff tries to draw the gar@@ ments from the sale after she went - what is just as good . &quot;
&quot; I would hate it , to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants home and find out that another woman she had and returned , and not wash@@ ed them wash@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; a spok@@ es@@ person from Pri@@ mark said : &quot; Pri@@ mark is the fore@@ front , which is aware of itself on Tuesday , 9 August in our Fili@@ ale in Folk@@ stone . &quot;

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from ceas@@ e@@ fire
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Daily@@ Mail could make it safer for you . &quot;
&quot; we talked with Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand@@ master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Ver@@ ban@@ ana in New York , to find out how to walk with armed rob@@ bers to the distance . &quot;
regardless of whether you approach yourself from the front or from the rear will show you this video as you turn off for your inc@@ ense .
&quot; if you turn to you from the back , then you should look at the first turn , so that you can see your att@@ acker from the shot &quot; , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
gra@@ b the weapon then between your front and your shoulder before you hit him with your free Ell@@ bow .
&quot; hit him then with knee into the body and rot@@ ate you , while the att@@ acking is afraid of pain , the weapon from his hands . hit him with the course and move back@@ wards , while they judge the weapon on it . &quot;
&quot; with Ang@@ ers that approach from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot , take the gun and turn them , so that the att@@ acker can not shoot . &quot;
&quot; shift the weight on the gun and propose the att@@ acker on the chest , then turn the weapon from its grip before they move back@@ wards and judge the weapon on it . &quot;

Rei@@ ke Ian W@@ right shr@@ ub to guide his tongue to the narrow places of Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ laid his immune system and thro@@ ef@@ ef@@ lex of a serious examination - by some of the dirty and ek@@ i@@ est places of Europe .
&quot; the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k sch@@ ab@@ ed its course on a Euro @-@ Sch@@ ein , a li@@ king at the Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a sink of a train toil@@ ette as well as a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance &apos;s resistance to its immune system . &quot;
&quot; before the waste , he used to show a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show up and show us what he will be released . &quot;
&quot; but the experim@@ ent that was fil@@ med under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; , brought some surprising results of the day@@ light . &quot;
&quot; the thought , the dish@@ washers of a traction chain , which was already used by thousands of others , but actually are in a kitchen sp@@ ice more poor bacteria . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical practition@@ ers across the promotion of intest@@ inal bacteria , as well as his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing left , what he ab@@ ou@@ den , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
&quot; Mr W@@ right was known for it to test the resistance to his Dar@@ ms , by the world ri@@ sts and peculi@@ ar and wonderful things . &quot;
&quot; from public funds to train stations up to dish@@ washers of toilets , the task set his immune system definitely under a sample . &quot;
&quot; in the film he told us : &quot; &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ worried about what my health concerns and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud water . &quot;
in the film he was in his call to do justice .
the inhal@@ er what he pun@@ ched , was a dirty public toilet in Russia . &quot;
its pro@@ cl@@ asp showed a L@@ umin@@ om@@ eter@@ rows of over 4000 units .
in comparison to that the L@@ umin@@ om@@ eter@@ umber is fresh in the hands less than 60 .
&quot; but there was Russian toilet that he dre@@ w consec@@ rated , after their L@@ umin@@ om@@ eter@@ rows over 4000 units was , while fresh wax@@ ed hands stays of less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o manufacturers &quot; &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the bacter@@ ial number in different places like the bathroom shows &quot;
&quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; that comes the worst , what I have in a toilet , close . &quot;
there is nothing dirty than that !
&quot; I will find nothing here , because it is inside it here . &quot;
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
&quot; the company held Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both lac@@ ke bacter@@ ial as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intest@@ inal bacteria and the immune system . &quot;
&quot; vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; we wanted to offer the consumers really something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to look and at the same time the benefits of pro@@ biot@@ ics explained .
&quot; we introduced crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings through , which ended that we said &quot; L@@ ass us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in the intest@@ inal health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and poor bacteria in our everyday surroundings , the importance of the intest@@ inal health and how they are linked to the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in the intest@@ inal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary film we could provide customers more information on an interesting manner .
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , which led the reg@@ ie of the film , added : &quot; let me have lost me so - I had thought my respect for Ian , which I have had some of things to l@@ essen , just like the ek@@ onom@@ y Russian toilet that is shown in the movie . &quot;
&quot; of course there were things that it was easier to bring Ian , Ian to do , and others , in which this was rather difficult . &quot;
I am glad that we have recorded some of these dirty l@@ eck@@ ers on film .
&quot; in one of the survey conducted by 2015 Associ@@ ated 84 percent of all inter@@ s@@ lu@@ gs , in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ine and 58 percent said that they are at least occasionally products , the bei@@ reb@@ els are included . &quot;
A@@ social family destro@@ ys before Del@@ og@@ ation soci@@ alw@@ ine in S@@ alt@@ ash , Cor@@ n@@ wall &quot;
a wood@@ p@@ ale family left their soci@@ alw@@ esen after a Del@@ og@@ ation with a damage in height of £ 5@@ 0.000 because they had res@@ ur@@ izes their neighbours .
&quot; T@@ anya Sk@@ el@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Cor@@ n@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after they were non@@ violent from their property , we found the grounds of the ground @-@ oper@@ atives in a ir@@ repar@@ able condition . &quot;
&quot; the walls will be f@@ aff@@ ing holes , wood@@ cock , tr@@ ash became scattered on the floor , and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to the walls . &quot;
the family were rebuilt and it is believed that they now lives in a private accommodation .
Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ oy who works for the household administration at Cor@@ n@@ wall Housing , said that they are afraid that the apartment is no longer be rep@@ aired . &quot;
she said : &quot; it was for people here an absolute night@@ mare and I am the view that people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
there are many things to consider since this property is pres@@ um@@ ably considered not so beautiful part of Cor@@ n@@ walls .
the family is hum@@ bled and its reputation is it also .
&quot; the couple had three sons , which lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror that had put the family , street abuse , sc@@ iss@@ ors , drug , and excessive swe@@ eping , riding and flu@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; Sk@@ el@@ don , 47 whose name was on the le@@ ase , got a arrangement for anti@@ social behavior . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which will be dem@@ ol@@ ished under circumstances , old tr@@ ash was found &quot;
&quot; they were tra@@ ded in the estate , in which in the past drugs were tr@@ apped , the wood@@ sh@@ aker . &quot;
&quot; neighb@@ ors said that they saw them on the road , and regularly brought the police regularly . &quot;
Cor@@ n@@ wall Housing del@@ ig@@ or@@ ated them and their partner this week non @-@ violent from the property after they gave them a pro@@ long@@ ed period of 11 weeks to give volunt@@ arily .
&quot; Del@@ og@@ ging were greeted by simpli@@ fied neighbours , told that their lives was made to hell . &quot;
&quot; one said , &quot; &quot; You sh@@ aded not to anyone . &quot;
we lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
&quot; the countless times we say the police here , are incredible . &quot;
&quot; today , we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood on because it was so quiet - that we were not usual !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , neighbourhood En@@ forcement Manager of Cor@@ n@@ wall Housing , said that it would have taken the family to cooperate with the local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house , called for the police in regular intervals , was 20 years long . &quot;
on the super@@ stret@@ ched side of the common house , tr@@ ash and old toys were not thrown down . &quot;
&quot; he added : &quot; it is a shame that it is the ten@@ ant to take any responsibility for their behavior and family , as a del@@ og@@ ation always is the last step is the Cor@@ n@@ wall Housing . &quot;
&quot; this was a very difficult case , as the behaviour was extremely difficult and their de@@ eds had to look for their neighbours . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Cor@@ n@@ wall , as well as members of the community , which we had come to us and have given us the information we have received . &quot;
&quot; I hope that this development is becoming a few neighbours , and the message conv@@ eys that anti@@ social behavior will not be toler@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 . &quot;
&quot; a dirty mattress , which has left in one of the bedrooms of the house after Del@@ og@@ ging on the ground . &quot;
workers of the household administration will now have to be g@@ arb@@ berge away which the house is surrounded by
&quot; in 2014 the police conducted a raid in the house through and found via 70@@ g cann@@ abis , as well as sc@@ ales , Parap@@ her@@ n@@ als and cash . &quot;
Sk@@ el@@ don was awarded a money @-@ pun@@ ishment after she had been aware of the owner of a drug class B in trading confidence .
they said that the money for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Sk@@ el@@ don was coming to life in 2013 .
&quot; after having been without Obama , it will have taken that T@@ anya and her partner will now live in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many room@@ mates of the house were filled with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that they will do Mi@@ eter del@@ og@@ ging that will not hold out of the balance .
Angela C@@ row from the police of De@@ von and Cor@@ n@@ wall shared with that the Del@@ og@@ ging is a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants that cannot be held on the balance .
&quot; this goes to those who may think that they can take away without self @-@ disc@@ ards , as well as those who have been damaged by such a behavior , &quot; she said . &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Cor@@ n@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that continue to work together with partners to protect our churches .

&quot; a Musical Po@@ bert Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ ein master@@ piece . &quot;
the artistic Lei@@ ger Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring about the Musical in the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary a youth@@ s .
&quot; in the Orch@@ ester@@ line the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an Di@@ conduc@@ tors Gust@@ av@@ o D@@ ud@@ am@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot;
we always say that they are very Latin @-@ shaped .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their mel@@ ody .
it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we have Bern@@ st@@ own music really in our blood !
in this producer Bart@@ oli play an older ge@@ wor@@ den@@ e Maria .
she re@@ minds with W@@ eh@@ arm@@ uth to her love with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and d@@ anced . &quot;
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
first because it is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and funny and bright . &quot;
&quot; so it is clever , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; they res@@ em@@ bles me very , my Italian character , which I have as a Roman , &quot; laugh@@ s Bart@@ oli . &quot;
&quot; D@@ ud@@ am@@ el is full of praise for the operators : &quot; Cec@@ ilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor to work with her .
it is a tremendous flow .
and Bart@@ oli returns the comp@@ liments back : &quot; D@@ ud@@ am@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
Di@@ rig@@ s is a necessity for him .
&quot; one sees it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheer@@ ful approach to life , which is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for the American director Philip WM . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; date : &quot; &quot; in this piece it is about pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
&quot; today we have had the refugees , at that time the buffer has gone to New York , and the New York residents did not want it . &quot;
&quot; they are the same issues , and they are just as meaning@@ ful as at that time . &quot;
59 years later the piece is still relevant .

&quot; as the newspaper under calling on figures of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the Tur@@ ks had already reported the largest group of justified by political persecution in Germany . &quot;
&quot; at the course of 30 June , it was 11.@@ 386 people and therefore almost 29 per cent of all accepted as asylum acknowled@@ ged ( 39.@@ 625 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , this collection does not find the face of war , poverty or a perspective of unemployment . &quot;
asylum seek@@ ers according to the Basic Law are solely politically , i.e. by state @-@ related site .
&quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; to go , where it we@@ ht@@ ut &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals do nothing from summer election with - and the holiday makers from North@@ rh@@ ine @-@ Westf@@ alia must not choose the country day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they have understood .
&quot; 2021 will not go back directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; for so far , there is not : summer holidays , heat and land @-@ sw@@ ept - that is h@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the locals , who are to be convinced by the leg@@ ia , are on vacation . &quot;
&quot; most vac@@ ation@@ ers that are in the countryside are , on Use@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not locals , so not to choose the country . &quot;
&quot; these are practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ pers , the post@@ ers show , bal@@ lo@@ ons blo@@ bs , fl@@ yers and count towards the end of the votes , only m@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
&quot; until 4 September 2016 , the elect@@ oral and last night @-@ day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has yet to pass over again to the people again . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his office . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , since 1998 is the strongest party , is now in surveys clearly behind the CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; exciting will be , as strong ne@@ ul@@ ing anus , and what remains at the end of Ko@@ ali@@ tion@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 subsi@@ dies , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive elect@@ oral election , one sees from his grand@@ parents . &quot;
&quot; he travelled through land , distributed ros@@ es and pl@@ au@@ es a little with the people , just as it was also its legend@@ ary liter@@ ac@@ ger predec@@ essor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , past@@ oral feet get cold feet , and gives ch@@ est@@ al Merkel the gu@@ ilt at the flo@@ ur@@ ishing of the anus . &quot;
&quot; their re@@ fuge@@ e policy , &quot; &quot; We create it &quot; &quot; to acceler@@ ates the rise of right damage , which is probably going to cost the beautiful office now . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with her nickname , the inner Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is , when you make a wrong time at the right place . &quot;
she has invited two ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel to major cont@@ amin@@ ants ; Merkel Bund@@ est@@ ag@@ ath@@ erh@@ kreis is located in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the target group not , there were more North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia , Berliner and Saxony as M@@ eckl@@ en@@ burger and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; kl@@ ed Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in the NDR . &quot;
&quot; but it is too bad to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , even Angela Merkel to listen . &quot;
otherwise the North @-@ CD@@ U largely disp@@ ose of the usual choice of elect@@ or@@ es on market spaces and in front of shopping centres with umbr@@ ell@@ as and bal@@ lo@@ ons .
&quot; this , so supp@@ ose Kok@@ ert , play only a &quot; &quot; minor role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; also , the Union has master@@ ed that you put away on the land the base away , that they have to be very rig@@ or@@ ous to find a wire to the people again . &quot;
&quot; you are going on as the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the wilderness of the country is hardly any present . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U @-@ fought against his fellow stri@@ ders is also self @-@ reli@@ eved : &quot; &quot; you must go there where there are we@@ alth@@ y , namely where people are : thor@@ ns , Gol@@ den@@ e weddings , every Birth@@ day party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because much on the game , Sell@@ ering his SPD is now called for a particularly committed election campaign . &quot;
&quot; in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats last recently with 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just just before the Af@@ lex ( 19 ) . &quot;
in the election of 2011 the SPD was still won by 35,@@ 6 percent prior to CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , small part@@ ying with seven percent in the surveys , is expected to create the le@@ ap into the country . &quot;
they make a modern virtu@@ e from the holiday @-@ Not a modern virtu@@ e and expos@@ e their elect@@ or@@ ant @-@ great @-@ part to the Internet .
&quot; online @-@ elections &quot; , &quot; it calls the provin@@ cial Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green elect@@ oral campaigns on the trace of local ab@@ yss among the tourists . &quot;
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the Spit@@ s@@ andi@@ d@@ atin , cur@@ v@@ t straight with a hous@@ ebo@@ at by the m@@ eckl@@ ist Lakes and finds it even beautiful . &quot;
your impression : &quot; election in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not pun@@ ishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ renovation : performances suffer from blo@@ cking
&quot; at the speed , with which the B 27 was refurbished , there is nothing to compl@@ ain . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible for the construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30 am in the morning and only at 20 o &apos;clock , there is all praise . &quot;
&quot; these have done everything pretty z@@ ack@@ y , &quot; tells El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the Jet @-@ gas station . &quot;
this is a Super@@ team .
there is no exp@@ ul@@ sion .
the job@@ site could be scheduled at the beginning of the half time as scheduled to the south until the end of October everything will be ready .
&quot; likewise , the dischar@@ ge will also be responsible for the construction works , even if it comes to the de@@ cor of housing . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site on Monday to the south , and also the blo@@ cking of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße was lifted up in Of@@ ter@@ burg , and therefore also the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg has come back to Rot@@ ten@@ burg , the traffic situation within the place relaxed . &quot;
the citizens can now proceed from Of@@ ter@@ dingen from the B 27 again .
ag@@ eing transport through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were partly significant dis@@ comfort , &quot; says the Managing Director of the renovation management of the armed Deputy Head of Florian King . &quot;
&quot; the residence from Bach@@ mann , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ n@@ erst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many barri@@ ers sought and rather their Nav@@ i familiar with the sign . &quot;
what led to this led to man@@ cher trucks in residential areas .
&quot; as well as the speed limit@@ ing does not have been respected , the municipality called for the vehicle &apos;s vehicle from M@@ ös@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; there was considerable transi@@ tions , &quot; says King , who made herself on site about the location . &quot;
there are already two to three per minute long ago .
the quick@@ est was on the road with 77 st@@ amp@@ hibi@@ ans in the pace @-@ 30 zone .
&quot; since the construction site , it has become more quiet , but it has become more quiet . &quot;
for the business@@ men at the B 27 there is only a small tro@@ ug@@ h that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg is now open the road again .
we are not happy to have a look at the cards of business@@ men .
&quot; but that the B 27 @-@ refurb@@ ishment has led to its sales @-@ down in them , everyone who asks the man . &quot;
&quot; however , some more and some less affected . &quot;
&quot; who has to do with the &quot; &quot; end customers &quot; , &quot; so for other companies , for which the refurb@@ ishment has hardly any consequences . &quot;
&quot; also at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Ma@@ ier , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; most slight decline , &quot; but also that of course &quot; the lear@@ ners is missing . &quot;
the strongest explo@@ ited are the Local in the street .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öhn@@ er , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ent .
&quot; not only him , but all restaurants have made it &apos; hard . &quot;
it was missing the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ ago . &quot;
we have to be glad to have more than any Euro turnover .
sales revenue grew by far more than 50 percent .
the road forces have thrown up its operation &quot; for two years . &quot;
half of his employees have to be released .
&quot; if I had been a company with 4000 employees and the half had been dischar@@ ged , the policy would have responded differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , the President Jörg Schmidt on a request of G@@ öhn@@ er whether there could be an financial compensation , with the reference to the B 27 Now they also find the dis@@ advantages that sur@@ render through the rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; g@@ öhn@@ er white from other land@@ ing travel , where such a solid tra@@ p was handled . &quot;
&quot; in all cl@@ agen , G@@ öhn@@ er is sure that his guest house will be continued . &quot;
&quot; finally , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other tribe are now less common because of the complex traffic cycle less frequently , he can understand . &quot;
&quot; if one cannot drive , it is also very different . &quot;
&quot; that his stem cli@@ ent@@ el returned to the end of the refurb@@ ishment , it has no doubt . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with B@@ SE and bird flu , G@@ öhn@@ er keeps the effects of the B 27 construction work on its customers for the greatest crisis which has experienced its guest house in their long standing history . &quot;
six months of construction work is already bru@@ tal .
constantly in the name of counter @-@ fight against laws .
&quot; after the recent attacks , the Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now puts a th@@ icker security package . &quot;
but what has a thing status to do with terror ?
and what does the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ate mean to all that ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the Com@@ promis@@ ers .
&quot; all of his proposals are politically vulnerable to the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ or , &quot; says the Bundes@@ interior Minister for the performance of his new safety package . &quot;
they are calling for anyone .
&quot; others , further points would first be discussed within the parties . &quot;
also very interesting I found myself .
&quot; as an internal minister , however , be in the results of the results , and in a &quot; achieved consensus &quot; within the Co@@ alition . &quot;
&quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , after recent attacks in Würzburg and An@@ sbach a little time , before he presents its conclusions for the safety in the Republic . &quot;
but they now fall into so much more widespread .
&quot; some is already known , announced that there is a new security authority to worry about the b@@ aked turn@@ key communication is not new . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also not the fact that Germany must implement several EU guidelines for passengers and weapons . &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and staff for safety authorities is also not surprising .
&quot; in part starts de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , a second starting point for proposals which were not to make up with the SPD so far , he wants to make sympathy for terr@@ ors , under pun@@ ishment , and ji@@ ha@@ dist@@ s with dou@@ bled citi@@ zenship . &quot;
&quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; space of the CD@@ U man . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he still consider this for reasonable and challenging even nothing , which have no chances for the co@@ ali@@ tional partner . &quot;
a few new ideas presents de Ma@@ izi@@ ère .
they have partially in itself : he is planning for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for gr@@ ass@@ ing people in front of the deport@@ ation .
&quot; refugees , which are targeted to the country in order to leave their smartphone , and to open the social media accounts for a safety ex@@ am . &quot;
&quot; in D@@ ul@@ ings for ex@@ pi@@ an asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to face some worse than so far - about such , the criminal off@@ ences or have consci@@ ously thro@@ wing their identity to wear their identity . &quot;
some of it is political and legally hei@@ ds@@ son .
man@@ ches also works un@@ balanced and leaves questions open .
and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of in@@ dul@@ es for example - puts the question : what does this actually mean to do safety and terror ?
&quot; yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the issues of refugees and terror . &quot;
&quot; however , it is not possible to speak that the attacks by An@@ sbach and Würzburg . &quot;
&quot; in addition , many people were worried about the high re@@ fuge@@ e concerns about security . &quot;
&quot; and things that people are deeply occupied , they are not exhau@@ sted even in the conditions of voting . &quot;
the inner security is enormous in the focus .
&quot; only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and An@@ sbach .
the locking is great .
&quot; and yes , there are options to be fought . &quot;
Union and SPD is therefore increasingly becoming a stance on the subject of inner security .
during the last days between the two parties went high .
&quot; only a gar@@ year@@ long argument about the equipment of the Federal police , then on a sports @-@ policy ideas of some Uni@@ ons @-@ Interior , in which the res@@ ort@@ ch@@ efs also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a withdrawal from the double citi@@ zenship . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also here to re@@ conc@@ il@@ able t@@ ints .
from a revers@@ al from a double pass he keep nothing .
we have the discussion in Germany with the possibility of extension .
&quot; they are re@@ mun@@ er@@ able , be no sensible . &quot;
and at a Bur@@ ka ban he have constitutional concerns .
&quot; whether his own package is constitutional on all corners and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; is not yet to show . &quot;
it is a bit dr@@ in that could make a dispute .
&quot; however , the SPD is currently attemp@@ ting to profil@@ ed itself in the subject of inner security . &quot;
&quot; Part@@ ech@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alized only once careful talk time and says : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to the security . &quot;
yet Volkswagen gli@@ ding is still coming through .
&quot; despite diesel engines , the delivery pay worldwide . &quot;
but not in all markets it runs round .
in the recall campaign there is a term .
Volkswagen starts with the excav@@ ations in the second half @-@ year .
&quot; in the course of Europe &apos;s largest high@@ land , in the previous year , despite the diesel technology thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ running markets continue to prove a plus . &quot;
&quot; but in July , the core brand VW above all in Western Europe and was charged back to the overall sale , as that in the D@@ ax not@@ ated companies . &quot;
&quot; throughout the world , the VW VW in July with 4@@ 49@@ 100 cars are sold by 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales of 14 percent under the previous year . &quot;
in the home market Germany res@@ em@@ ails around almost a hex@@ ag@@ ons .
brand assistant Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann conducted the weak@@ est figures from July especially on two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; in addition , it has given a commercial framework in some core markets &quot; &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the co@@ up attempt in Turkey , the British vote for the dischar@@ ge from the EU , explain a spok@@ es@@ person . &quot;
&quot; in the U.S. , where the gas@@ es were first escal@@ ated , there is also further a minus . &quot;
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; in total , the mainly concerned house@@ wives of the lower house of the Lower Saxony : after the first seven months is only a balance minus from 0.3 percent to 3.8 million vehicles at be@@ ech . &quot;
consolidated Fred Kap@@ pler was able to propose a sales board from January to July .
&quot; 1,3 percent more vehicles provided Volkswagen at this time , worldwide 5,@@ 904 million . &quot;
Volkswagen had manip@@ ulated with a software Ab@@ gast@@ tests .
&quot; alone in Germany , VW around 2.5 million car calls for refurb@@ ishment into the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the retro@@ fitting VW , that the conversion of cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after the change@@ over of vehicles there are fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor power whatsoever . &quot;
&quot; the motorway place the customer after the change@@ over a &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; certificate , but not of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was called on Friday in the company . &quot;
reasons are legal matters .
&quot; the &quot; focus &quot; had reports , Volkswagen granted his German customers now yet a guarantee for reduced diesel models . &quot;
these were confirmed on the last Monday VW representatives of the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs .
&quot; from the German Department , it was confirmed that there was this meeting . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; VW has been fully committed to the conditions of my investig@@ ator Commission and the KBA . &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations of these are not accepted , &quot; explained Federal Minister of Alexander do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( C@@ SU ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has assumed the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor power after the conversion , no deteri@@ or@@ ations will take place and all type @-@ approved vehicle values have unchanged . &quot;
Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not as it was in company travel .
&quot; in the wide term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; Volkswagen the possibility for example a half year after the change@@ over approximately with a motorcycle shop in a workshop - and this will lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do . &quot;
&quot; also in the customer interest , it is important to avoid that in any other damage , that there is nothing to do with the ass@@ ass@@ ing sc@@ andal with respect to any kind of warran@@ ties , as it was called it . &quot;
therefore we use VW the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
the ra@@ i@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from rich austerity - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; Bank Josef Paul said on Thursday , &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers , which park a 40 million euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or day@@ light . &quot;
&quot; the German Bundes@@ verband Deutsch@@ er banks speaks of a single case , and does not see any signal : normal as@@ par@@ agus would have to pay for their austerity law . &quot;
&quot; camps banks money over night in the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay for their 0,@@ 4 percent prison . &quot;
this fee demands the ra@@ i@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund from September by private and corporate clients for deposits over 100.000 euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or day @-@ cash back .
&quot; the first 100,000 euro are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100.000 costs € 400 per year , &quot; said Paul . &quot;
he has gone up to 40 million Euros that could be lifted from one day to another and that he could not be embarrass@@ ed .
&quot; these lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.3 percent cost , &quot; said the bank@@ er . &quot;
&quot; I can not lie for any million 4000 Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs shall continue on the principle after the exp@@ iry principle .
&quot; the bar@@ gain simply lie in the Tres@@ ores of the ra@@ i@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank , would be much too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four over@@ cases , I am not yet the fifth ! &quot; , &quot; said the bank@@ notes . &quot;
most customers would have their understanding and are rarely on other forms of requests .
only few emig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; the cooper@@ atives of Bavaria , &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot;
&quot; they alone to wear , be &quot; &quot; economic permanently not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some German banks therefore have raised their fees for performance , credit cards or transfers . &quot;
with prison for deposits of three million euros had made the Thuring@@ ian Volks@@ - and ra@@ i@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank Alten@@ burg Land with its skat@@ bank branches 2014 head@@ lines .
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , captain of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect private clients ═ Rem@@ uner@@ ations for deposits , this is the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks too much too strong . &quot;
&quot; a bank@@ er said , at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a cli@@ ent@@ el , which is equipped with the assets somewhat l@@ ush . &quot;
&quot; this can be used for a small bank to the problem , if they are free money . &quot;
&quot; the 1911 @-@ co @-@ oper@@ atives G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gladly , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; in the region , known actors , ath@@ letes and entrepreneurs . &quot;
&quot; currently , the co @-@ oper@@ atives of Bavaria &quot; are currently not known for other banks that calcul@@ ates a compensation for deposits of individuals , &quot; said speaker Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the president of the Bundes@@ verband der German folk banks and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank ( Bv@@ R ) , Uwe cheer@@ ful , had declared the end of June : &quot; the thres@@ hold to go into the neg@@ atives , is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; the competition be tough , and it threat@@ ens the emig@@ ration to competitors . &quot;
the customers in Germany will not be able to leave the width in width .
destination plates : who does not buy sound @-@ plates ?
lon@@ ely men love middle age @-@ plates .
&quot; before you ap@@ point the comm@@ ent@@ ation , in order to sur@@ render him under the p@@ seud@@ onym of non @-@ vacc@@ ines with r@@ ust insul@@ ts , this statement deri@@ ves from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the most recent resurrection of sound boards not to a B@@ oom in Mill@@ enni@@ als , who want to greet the re@@ alism of physical objects , but to Mid@@ life no@@ stal@@ gia . &quot;
&quot; those who have recently bought a record , all pre @-@ view is between 45 and 54 . &quot;
in fact the age group of 18 @-@ 24 the most likely buyers .
it is also not a hor@@ des due to Hob@@ by@@ g@@ aps - it has an emotional importance : older flat@@ s. keep her feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % v@@ s. 53 % ) and enjoy it to spend alone time ( 69 % v@@ s. 66 % ) .
but agree the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; if this blog would like a news report on TV , I would follow me the camera while I walk in the midst of a busy road in So@@ ho , a mod@@ est thro@@ wing de@@ duction , and wild sc@@ aled , my hands hold and something defe@@ ated as : &quot; so , let us take a close look at it . &quot;
so let us take a look at it .
&quot; even if the heart so@@ hos slow in its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where they were once an independent seller . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the camer@@ aman that I place the camera for the next part , in which I stand in the immediate vicinity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and vegetables . &quot;
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glas@@ gow , 55 , whom I benefit from S@@ ister Ray ( data number : eight men aged aged ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men middle age ) , a woman , pres@@ um@@ ably for the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and passes through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
is he a coll@@ ector that I ask ?
&quot; I already appreciate , &quot; he says . &quot;
I have approx . 3.000 or 4.000 plates .
&quot; this sound@@ plates , top left ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I am not followed at home ) , dress the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he poss@@ esses such a considerable number of albums and singles , the result of his available income : it is now able to buy plates , which he could not afford when she appeared and again to buy objects that he sold , when he was young and pl@@ ast@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; many things that I bought are from the late 60@@ s , early 70@@ s who appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things that I probably was something too young to buy them , &quot; says he says . &quot;
&quot; he agre@@ es that those who are buying plates , more intro@@ ver@@ ted , and would like to spend time , and adds : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I drink not much . &quot;
this is my L@@ aster .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who is working at S@@ ister Ray , believes that many customers who meets the You@@ Go@@ v &apos;s Profile . &quot;
&quot; he also noticed a new wave of fol@@ ks that have influenced by the Medi@@ enh@@ pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eb@@ ack and can be seen again to buy their old plates . &quot;
&quot; by the conversations that I have led , people usually have done so about 1998 or 1999 their collection . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their plates to buy CDs , now sell their CDs to buy their records again . &quot;
this would explain the B@@ oom to followers of the turn@@ around of a certain age .
but what about the genital emotional importance of plates ?
&quot; it takes only a few seconds in a shop such as Ph@@ onica , to recognize that record stores a so@@ othing community of equ@@ minded people . &quot;
&quot; according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers participated in the contact@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and would like to move to the stability of familiar Schall@@ platten , of objects , the happ@@ ier it@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; I think , sometimes it can be the filling of a void or the possession materi@@ ally pos@@ sessions as a kind of tro@@ p , &quot; &quot; said WE@@ Z . &quot;
that is as a coll@@ ector and I think that it is so many people so .
it is a simple way to mentally engaged .
&quot; we are like their welfare workers ! &quot; fl@@ aws an employee of a plat@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; a survey of the IC@@ M in April un@@ v@@ eil@@ ed that nearly 50 % of the people who bought the last month a record , they have not heard yet . &quot;
&quot; the survey also found out that 41 % have a record player that they never use , while 7 % of those who have a record , no record player . &quot;
&quot; at this time of news , I would probably look very concerned while I have seen through a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova Kom@@ pil@@ ots . &quot;
&quot; J@@ onny , 42 , who works in Sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men middle age ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy &quot; of the Re@@ vi@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; someone came only recently here and said , &quot; I had no record player , but I would like to buy a radio plate , so that I can put them into a shelf . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it is definitely happening . &quot;
&quot; more product las@@ ered , less musical . &quot;
&quot; we have people who say , &quot; I have no record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not elderly , which only slowly come . &quot;
&quot; F@@ op@@ p , which has devoted almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience , as I guess . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists , the photos make teenage boys and women middle age . &quot;
&quot; even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the pre@@ standing shops , the Wild Be@@ asts Syn@@ thesizer sounds and sex@@ ually mature pop instead of experim@@ ental Jazz dr@@ il@@ able from the lou@@ d@@ speakers - it is good to see such di@@ vin@@ ity at the customer . &quot;
&quot; none of them sees son@@ der@@ ly lon@@ ely , but fier@@ ce psych@@ mat@@ a are difficult to be able if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs for several minutes in the shop and considers the variation of the sale standing . &quot;
it rather makes a bucket @-@ her@@ ed@@ ges as a big purchase .
&quot; it doesn &apos;t deserve much , therefore the collecting of records is not a real option , says it . &quot;
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to hear music from a computer or in other way but the beauty of plates is ... it drives with a loved S@@ eu@@ f@@ zer .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it is really unique .
&quot; my last h@@ alt is a business , by which is said that a new generation of turn@@ tables have to inspired : urban out@@ fit@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; as I like to give the An@@ nie @-@ hot@@ line , watching a group of young teenage girl who group himself for a moment for Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras , before a father and his daughter think to buy a Cros@@ ley record player . &quot;
&quot; on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , J@@ eff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; nobody sees them - perhaps because they are only purely decorative , some as far above that it is impossible to summar@@ ize them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that every attraction for these objects might mean more money for the industry , and some customers could send to the dep@@ ths so@@ hos for more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain . &quot;
&quot; there is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , also the one that is most suitable for luxury homes as plates . &quot;
&quot; even though my post@@ pon@@ ds revealed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they leave , at least in plate shops in So@@ ho , the great number of female collectors , and in Onlin@@ e@@ for@@ en exist , un@@ considered . &quot;
these people are likely to work hard at school or in offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday morning with certainty , not with the B@@ um@@ m@@ ules by record stores of Ber@@ wick Street and leaves through plates , while keeping the star@@ r@@ end view of an und@@ ant , 30 @-@ year false moderator above the shoul@@ ders of the middle ages . &quot;

French Court bor@@ row@@ ed offer on A@@ br@@ iss of shops in the jungle @-@ re@@ fuge@@ e camp
&quot; a French court has dec@@ lined an offer of authorities in Cal@@ ais , do@@ zens of provis@@ ional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais to live in the thousands of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the authorities ar@@ gu@@ ed this week ar@@ gu@@ ed the authorities in Cal@@ ais that the state should be be@@ fu@@ sible , 72 provis@@ ional shops , sell cigar@@ ettes to Energ@@ ydr@@ inks , sell hair@@ dressing services , or simple meals for a few euros in provis@@ ional restaurants . &quot;
the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais ar@@ gu@@ ed that these places should be lower than they would pose a parallel economy out of which no taxes would be paid out of which no taxes and san@@ itation risk .
&quot; humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals are offered by the state supported association and other groups , not enough food for the growing numbers in stock . &quot;
they also carried out that provis@@ ional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the assignment of people who operate the 72 provis@@ ional shops , but spatial that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais are absolutely understand@@ able . &quot;
&quot; judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that the food stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just people to feed that live in extremely prec@@ ari@@ ous conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas will offer quiet meeting between refugees and volunte@@ ers .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by the defe@@ ats , the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , the community @-@ team is operated and 200 meals a day , English and French authorities for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed the peti@@ tion to preserve the kids &apos; café . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian was it that the closing time for these children would be a catastrophe , of which the recent eight years are old . &quot;
&quot; the two Au@@ xiliary organizations Help Refugees and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants arrive on Friday , that the number of people in the jungle live grew up over 9.@@ 000 people - the highest number up to now - after a steep rise of re@@ fu@@ ge in the course of summer . &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement trailer
&quot; Germany ras@@ er to adjust to the next generation of speeds : in various Länder , among other things in Hessen und Brandenburg , new flash devices will be tested especially effective , the Tem@@ pos@@ er are particularly effective . &quot;
the fut@@ uris@@ tic eff@@ ecting En@@ forcement trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example at random score where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
&quot; for example , at the highway construction , or to san@@ ing bridges with temporary Tem@@ plate , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with a stationary bl@@ itzer for the observ@@ ance of speed limit@@ ing . &quot;
but a continuous mobile construction can be too dangerous or co@@ stly .
&quot; the En@@ forcement trailer is aut@@ ark : his battery holds five days , the par@@ amount data is encryp@@ ted via a modem . &quot;
&quot; with laser measurement technology , all cars can also be recorded across multiple tracks simultaneously . &quot;
&quot; variable speed reduc@@ ers as well as diameters of time , driving and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
in the high @-@ run condition one can move the p@@ endant according to manufacturer with every car with a trailer coupling .
&quot; that he is not easy to use , it is reduced in the exhibition , so that the wheels in the ground@@ ed and by the inci@@ dent@@ ally disappear . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should be protected against v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
since 2015 the trailer are tested according to information from Vit@@ ronic in various Länder and now also used .
&quot; foreign authorities are also off@@ spring with the new technique : younger , France has dec@@ lined 100 pieces after an order of 150 copies last year . &quot;
UK pick silver in 7 @-@ er Rugby after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold gets
&quot; the impressive performance of Britain at 7 @-@ er Rugby came in fin@@ als on Thursday evening to an ab@@ rupt H@@ alt at the last H@@ ür@@ de in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were be@@ aten with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ odoro stage here in Rio . &quot;
&quot; Fi@@ ji pro@@ claimed a master@@ class in the handling , Side @-@ St@@ epp@@ ing , Post @-@ back and ro@@ her power to win gold - their first Olympi@@ am@@ ed@@ al of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was caused by the not too bad Tro@@ st@@ al price of the silver med@@ al - Great Britain &apos;s fourth to this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which it would be proud of New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the marked defeat of the B@@ oks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ fin@@ als on the same day could be back in the fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; but regardless of it , f@@ ji would have be@@ aten a 15 @-@ man team in order . &quot;
&quot; it could be for GB - but it is probably not - that at least a bre@@ ite tomorrow a gold med@@ al to hang its neck : Fi@@ j@@ is Ch@@ ef@@ trainer Ben Ry@@ an , the former chief for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind him .
about eight years ago she lost at Ry@@ an every game at Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost one .
&quot; this fl@@ ap is we@@ ht@@ un , but the progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji began wonderful and let the attacks come out of fun .
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co . on , as if you run in driving buses run . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 to the top , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with just four minutes of playing Jerry Tu@@ w@@ ai , Jerry Tu@@ w@@ ai was still another attack from the right corner , which he walked . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB has almost lost the ball .
a h@@ ev@@ or@@ rag@@ ender T@@ ackle from Mitchell stops the mountain from male Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third gate to achieve but it has Fi@@ ji only stopped .
in the seventh minute l@@ ete J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a in the right corner a touch@@ down and it was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re @-@ fi@@ ff and there was still over a minute play@@ time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ et by more weak backl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ m@@ ed up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the pause .
&quot; it is like it was f@@ ji to be born , the 7 to play , while GB still was d@@ az@@ ul@@ ern@@ t . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; GB led fundamental changes to the half @-@ time through and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the circumstances of the first half @-@ time until Jos@@ ua Tu@@ is@@ ova was going through a brilliant intermediate play of Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 but the game ran already long in favour of the southern se@@ ein@@ ans , whose fans s@@ angen , flags , and d@@ anced on the tri@@ b@@ une . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the play@@ ful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a Vi@@ li@@ ame sat the cake icing with another attempt in the last seconds .
the p@@ fi@@ ff @-@ rays the Fi@@ j@@ is re@@ arm@@ oured and GB be@@ ick@@ ed crus@@ hing in the grass .
&quot; formerly in the day , Fi@@ ji Japan had defe@@ ated in the semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 defe@@ ats and Great Britain in a kn@@ uck@@ le half @-@ fin@@ als from the race - Great Britain conversion of the difference . &quot;
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the B@@ oks in the first half after front , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ wear and achieved a gate among the post in the second half . &quot;
&quot; late late backl@@ ash by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side Teams , sick@@ le the gain - and thus the silver med@@ al . &quot;
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning by battle with the cancer of the trainer
there will be no ra@@ qu@@ in@@ aler@@ es gold as with these games and that wants what hot .
&quot; from the first rowing king up to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve , who go into history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional significance in their golden moment on the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even though it was only the examples which were on the bur@@ st , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was all present as they put on the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in two without tax @-@ lady in succ@@ ession , the first women placed in the history of the British Sports , which was placed on such a scale . &quot;
&quot; your domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all their 39.@@ was un@@ trained deployment , which is likewise exempl@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant ath@@ let@@ ies , which slide about the surface with the elegance of sp@@ ice , which is not reflected the type of tri@@ um@@ ph@@ es . &quot;
&quot; behind every gold in the ru@@ ders , a batch of wild hel@@ pers , which contribute to the incre@@ mental advances , which was unable to survive the difference and there was no one no longer knew when he was diagnosed each day than with it cancer . &quot;
as he said he was ris@@ ky .
&quot; I had bub@@ bles , the surgery is and they did . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do this , spread themselves everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a rather sh@@ lim@@ me situation .
it changes a little bit of view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio had luck that he could start at the beginning of 2014 , out of the season , could start the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , if that is under such circumstances the proper term . &quot;
I needed money so I had to go back again soon .
it was an incen@@ tive .
&quot; I was in hospital and ran around at the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough . &quot;
this is how it begins .
&quot; the ru@@ ders in itself is a challenge , but this makes it a bigger one . &quot;
&quot; in the in@@ erti@@ lity of the victory , her first thought of Williams , who spent a ner@@ ve @-@ cre@@ ten morning , that he spent a little more than anything else and tried to process its own fears . &quot;
&quot; anning , who was as captain in the Royal Arti@@ ll@@ ery Reg@@ im@@ ent in an use in Afghanistan , &quot; &quot; I was this week an emotional w@@ re@@ ck . this is perhaps something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it is repeatedly , how much I mean , how much I and hel@@ mets , and also Robin have worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we would be no one , therefore a massive thanks to him . he is the best coach of the world . &quot;
I could not have a better person for trainers or a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no races in the last five years .
the pair had a hard rhythm that cannot cope with their opponents .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark b@@ ending , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had a lot to reserve . &quot;
we were very caught at the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; lead in the process , keep in the process . &quot;
it is really important to do not let them rip .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not doing something great .
&quot; we wanted no fire@@ work today , we wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race what we did . &quot;
the pair will take a break for one year before making decisions over its future will meet .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , your own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that my last race was .
this would have had a lot of pressure .
&quot; in London it took about six months , to gr@@ asp that I am a Olympi@@ ans . &quot;
it was all so new to me and I was so .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
31 years are exempl@@ ary for clarity
&quot; the managing director of the water @-@ purpose &quot; &quot; V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ gruppe &quot; , &quot; R@@ aun@@ t Gö@@ ller , goes to retirement . &quot;
the association is considered &quot; bay@@ ern@@ wide exempl@@ ary . &quot; &quot;
a small fr@@ ing@@ ian drinking water association as a model for the large water producers .
this was how some time ago it was in the origin@@ als of the Bayer@@ ischer Rund@@ funk .
little later the water@@ forum of the government of under@@ fran@@ ken the mer@@ ger association .
the work of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ gruppe Ren@@ umer@@ ations &quot; bay@@ ern@@ far as exempl@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; behind all this is Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller , which was 31 years in the twelve @-@ association staff , which was 28 years as managing director . &quot;
he was reti@@ red at the age of 65 years in retirement .
&quot; the tip @-@ purpose of the V@@ eit@@ endorf group , based in K@@ ott@@ endorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , promotes annually about 15@@ 0000 cu@@ bic meters of water and supplies 32 places and ham@@ let with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; member states are the churches of Kirch@@ lau@@ ter , Broad@@ brunn , loud , E@@ bel@@ sbach and the city of Bre@@ ach . &quot;
for more towns and villages there are water supply agreements .
&quot; the current chairman , the Breit@@ brun@@ ns Civil Championship in Ger@@ tru@@ d B@@ üh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , re@@ minded that Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller 1985 was appointed as a Aqu@@ ar@@ et and was appointed to the managing director of the For@@ ces association . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very varied and they dis@@ gu@@ ards from the water supply and maintenance work on office and organiz@@ ation@@ ism , the budget of fees and contributions up to emergency approaches to weekends &quot; , &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as outstanding events they called the commissioning and inaugur@@ ation of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , the property of the new fountain ( 1998 ) , and compensation for farmers , re@@ dem@@ ption of a central computer control ( 2004 ) , and the participation of water@@ lines . &quot;
there have been no down@@ time and you have always included innovations because water life be@@ de@@ ute and drinking water is the most important food be .
&quot; in their Lau@@ d@@ atio , they pra@@ ised the faithful , reliable , and correct service over 31 years . &quot;
&quot; he has used with a lot of heart blo@@ t for his water @-@ purpose , and he has lived up the water @-@ purpose association , as if it would be his own company . &quot;
&quot; in a few weeks ago , he was a real practition@@ er to present the successful concept of the V@@ eit@@ y @-@ group to the nit@@ rogen in front of the water@@ forum of the district Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia . &quot;
he received very much recognition and praise for this .
Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller to pra@@ ised all the fount@@ ains of Al@@ f@@ ons g@@ sa@@ el which have worked together with him for the age of 28 years .
he is the best water al@@ ke@@ eper and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as a highlights from his view , he referred to the Brun@@ n@@ ulture and the restructuring of the mer@@ ger association . &quot;
but the greatest challenge and the hard@@ est use were the pipe at the flo@@ ck of Kirch@@ lau@@ ter at a 3rd January .
&quot; here , at minus 17 degrees the whole night will work through , so that the loc@@ alities were supplied with water . &quot;
&quot; even the supply of Neub@@ run@@ n can once only be maintained , because you filled the flo@@ ck of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses . &quot;
&quot; the management of the drinking water @-@ purpose , was handed over to Daniel St@@ ür@@ mer from lau@@ ter , which occurs the succ@@ ession of Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller . &quot;
&quot; the Sop@@ ran@@ isti@@ n Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko goes openly with the au@@ tism of her son , and is turning to other affected parents : &quot; they must have the courage to talk about it . &quot;
&quot; the medicine has made great progress , &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper &quot; Cor@@ ri@@ ere della Ser@@ a . &quot;
&quot; when the disease had been recognized by the Son , they have believed , they kis@@ ses dying . &quot;

relationship in Bar@@ sh@@ eh@@ eide - man sho@@ ots to the li@@ fel@@ ine
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man was wo@@ und@@ ed on Friday at 10 : 45 in a multi@@ house in Bar@@ gt@@ eh@@ eide ( district stor@@ mar@@ n ) on his partner .
&quot; the man has been called upon us and stated to have shot his li@@ fel@@ ine . &quot; &quot; said a police @-@ speaker . &quot;
the perpet@@ rators be on the run , after him will be publicly available . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , because Sven S. could be on the road by car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1,@@ 80 meters tall , mus@@ cular , brown and has a gl@@ az@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the police released a photo of him . &quot;
it is a couple of years old .
meanwhile the man carries a gl@@ at@@ se .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still bear the weapon in itself so the police .
&quot; who Sven S. sees , the 110 will call you . &quot;
the police speaks of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ rators 1981 . &quot;
the competent police in Lübeck wanted to initially make no information on the T@@ ather@@ dive or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims ; they confirmed that a man had been killed .
&quot; it is a pot@@ tery . &quot;
&quot; more we do not say , &quot; said a police @-@ speaker in Lübeck . &quot;
saying it was a specialist er@@ ecting mand@@ o ( SEK ) at the Tat@@ ort .
steel - Light@@ ing for German steel industry
the k@@ ris@@ ky explo@@ ited and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains of additional costs in milli@@ on@@ enh@@ öhe !
financial bur@@ dens that are dro@@ ught the industry from the eco @-@ electricity promotion , are of the table . &quot;
&quot; it lead in the liberation of renewable energy sources with the components for so called equity production in the German steel industry , said the Federal Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West German General Newspaper &quot; ( W@@ AZ , Frei@@ sler ) . &quot;
&quot; I am really happy that we were able to reach the negotiations after two years . &quot;
&quot; the European Commission was planned to first plan the steel manufacturer , the gas@@ es from the ho@@ cho@@ ols to generate electricity generation for your own consumption , to request check@@ out . &quot;
the steel industry decre@@ ases additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the W@@ AZ , there is now a basic cleaning with the EU Commission after discussions with competitive com@@ pressor Mar@@ gre@@ the Vest@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when generators in the steel structures will be replaced , all an E@@ EG lev@@ y of 20 percent . &quot;
but also this will not be raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the European Commission in equity .
&quot; thus , the status quo of the current regulations become largely determined . &quot;
particular significance have the successful ter@@ mination of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; Stahl &quot; &quot; is the first step . &quot;
&quot; further need to follow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; even in the reform of the em@@ ission reduction are climate and employment targets , &quot; explained IG Metall @-@ Chef Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from the financial crisis 2008 in excess capacity and a significant pricing .
&quot; last year , the situation further intensi@@ fied , as the world &apos;s largest emp@@ owerment in China given the weak@@ ling native demand in the world market . &quot;
European manufacturers thro@@ wing Chinese steel cor@@ nets .
in the course of this early years the situation has something relaxed .
&quot; to show a hand susp@@ ended obj@@ ections on impor@@ ter effect , for others have the economic views in China . &quot;
&quot; un@@ clear , as sustain@@ ably the discounts is . &quot;
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp stayed on Thursday careful .
&quot; finally , the prices were more st@@ agn@@ ated again . &quot;
the sector is responding to the difficult situation with further cost savings .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp wanted not to include lock@@ ers of individual works as well .
in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 some 86@@ ,000 people were busy . &quot;
&quot; in July , the German steel manufacturer remain cau@@ tious despite increasing prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; with 3,4 million tons of less than six percent lower raw steel than in the prior year months , as the economic association &apos;s galvan@@ ized steel on Friday . &quot;
after a short increase in May the amount got back the second month in a row .

the association is counting in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation with an increasing output .
&quot; community , mind , health : singing does Sen@@ i@@ oren &quot;
&quot; singing has accompanied by Ur@@ sel K@@ ip@@ p her whole life : as young girl was it in the school choir , in the school student , she bes@@ ieg@@ ed the F@@ ach music , and today it s@@ ings the 78 @-@ year @-@ old in a Sen@@ i@@ oren choir . &quot;
&quot; singing moves me - emotional and physical , &quot; describes them . &quot;
&quot; after a sample it feels balanced , cheer@@ ful and a total of living , says it . &quot;
&quot; at the next door , she does something good for her health and her spirit . &quot;
for S@@ ingen is the same from several perspectives a great hobby for seniors , says Er@@ hard returns from the German seniors . &quot;
&quot; most sen@@ i@@ oren singing in the choir and share with equal enjoyment of music , describes the backl@@ ash . &quot;
through regular assem@@ blies they can establish social contacts and maintain social contacts .
&quot; because often , social and family structures at the age of , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience also made Ur@@ sel K@@ ip@@ p in their choir : &quot; to speak and organize themselves to the others , and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being . &quot;
sing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense .
for this exercise sen@@ i@@ ores a deep and controlled breathing .
&quot; who regularly calls his l@@ ungs regularly , also in everyday life not as fast from the d@@ est . &quot;
&quot; even if it is about obtaining the sound of voice at the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; on older people there have often a very special effect , says Urs@@ ula L@@ enz , from the federal government of the Sen@@ iors organisations . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations the common singing had a much higher priority , it belong@@ ed to everyday life , both at school and in leisure time , she explains . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz are often observed that the singing or listening of songs with older men w@@ akes many memories , often linked with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
through Li@@ ed@@ tex@@ te and especially mel@@ o@@ dies off himself dem@@ o@@ bes@@ ed people in the long back@@ ward events .
&quot; when singing , the head will also calls for a special performance , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , focus on their own voice and on a pre @-@ given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cogni@@ tive challenge . &quot;
&quot; older people who live alone , practice so , not only concentrate on himself . &quot;
another positive aspect is the recognition that one drives through the singing in the choir , the backl@@ ash . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
also the self @-@ este@@ em grows by the S@@ ingen in the choir .
&quot; to show yourself : when I try something for something , I will better and guard over me - this experience strength@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start with the singing , there is enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he supp@@ ose , little talent . &quot;
&quot; you s@@ sing yes not alone - at 50 Sing@@ ing people , who sounds like a tone next to them ? &quot;
looking for the right offer you have seniors different options , says H@@ backl@@ ash . &quot;
&quot; sing someone from the acquain@@ t@@ ances in a senior choir , one can easily connect . &quot;
many cities also offer over@@ views over cho@@ irs in the area .
&quot; who wants to sing in a church choir , can turn directly to the church or the Church . &quot;
many seniors also can be found via the Internet .
&quot; who has no access to the internet , can ask the family , friends or neighbours around the Internet . &quot;
&quot; who desire has to sing , should be sure to connect to a choir . &quot;
singing the soul is good and has a little liber@@ ating - this applies to all ages .
Cats react sensitive than cr@@ ater on scre@@ ens of the young animals
bi@@ ologists have been studied in Hanover , what effect the ru@@ ps of cat@@ fish is on adult animals . &quot;
&quot; to her surprise , the ten@@ se left the male too cold - however , they stopped in contrast to the females always the same . &quot;
female cats can recognize the arous@@ al of cat@@ ch@@ ys at the Mi@@ ew of the Cl@@ one .
they react to ten percent faster to Lau@@ der by k@@ ittens who have found himself in great dist@@ ress to find out how scientists found by the veterinary University and Medical University Hannover ( M@@ HH ) .
k@@ ater also react to the ru@@ fe of k@@ ittens - but always the same .
&quot; evi@@ d@@ ently , the acoustic differences between the distr@@ ust of less and strongly arous@@ ed young for the males either not percei@@ ved or not of importance , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding by the M@@ HH . &quot;
it is first published in the study that was published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ u@@ tionary Bi@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; in a previous study , the research team had already found that the duration and sound height of the k@@ ittens will be distinguished with the ur@@ gency of their assistant . &quot;
&quot; observed have been observed in total nine adults , and eight kne@@ es from the animal presence of the M@@ HH . &quot;
&quot; they were played for a ru@@ fe of sounds , which were taken for three minutes from the root box and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; for the other , they were faced with the cry of stronger k@@ ittens who were additionally raised up . &quot;
the researchers comply with their results despite the low sampling for meaning@@ ful .
&quot; all females , even those who had not had an own off@@ spring , re@@ acted differenti@@ ated on the writing , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
they dre@@ w up faster to the lou@@ d@@ speakers if this ru@@ fe has been very exhau@@ sted k@@ ittens .
this ability could possibly be inn@@ ed or develop with the sex .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have been re@@ acted at all , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already studied several times in human beings who studied the reactions of women and men on child@@ birth . &quot;
&quot; also , some studies showed that women have more sensitive to inf@@ ants that they were already conc@@ e@@ aled or not , reported the Bi@@ olog@@ in Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann . &quot;

the sport is - like the whole land - split into suppor@@ ters and opponents of Erd@@ og@@ an .

&quot; what the gro@@ s of the Tur@@ ks , but given the dramatic experience in history , the strict rejection of military put@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; even there are even the fans even - no matter whether you have heart for Gal@@ ver@@ ar@@ ay or sett@@ ling . &quot;

despite d@@ oping : these ath@@ letes still have med@@ als opportunities at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was already locked up twice because of d@@ ow@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lowers in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova may not start in Rio .
others over athle@@ tics @-@ sin@@ ner can only lau@@ gh it - they fight in Rio around med@@ als .
&quot; the topic of D@@ oping still determines how the Headlines at the Olympic Games in Rio . &quot;
&quot; the Russian swi@@ mer@@ in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , which had failed in front of games after a d@@ oping lock , was inc@@ ur@@ red before playing ( 100 meters chest ) welcome and explo@@ ited . &quot;
it offered a sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile scen@@ eries : with a set smile it was still st@@ um@@ bled in the hall and had pro@@ long@@ ed with her performance .
&quot; to be fes@@ tive that they will not get gold , the audience broke into a J@@ ub@@ cr@@ ash@@ m . &quot;
&quot; but there are many other sports , which have been going to go into the start despite the d@@ oping past at the Olympic Games in Rio . &quot;
here an overview :
&quot; J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the contro@@ versi@@ al figures in the athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was already two times because of d@@ ow@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
&quot; since his spell runs the Olympi@@ asi@@ eger from 2004 and ex @-@ world master even faster than before , it is about 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds the number one of the world and is considered the biggest editor of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / Jam@@ aica ) : the two @-@ time Olympi@@ ans and seventh World Championship had to sit down in 2010 after taking the intake of the pain through Oxy@@ co@@ don . &quot;
they have had strong dental pain after an operation was def@@ ended the 29 @-@ year @-@ old .
Sandra Per@@ ko@@ vic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : 2011 the Olympi@@ ast@@ eg@@ ress of 2012 , World Championship in 2013 and European Championship has been positive to the ver@@ bot@@ ene stimul@@ ant means meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine . &quot;
Per@@ ko@@ vic meets the most ignor@@ ant and was locked in six months .
the four wid@@ est thro@@ ws this year are going to go to the account of the great gold fav@@ ors .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ seb@@ ack ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing @-@ Olympi@@ asi@@ eger and two @-@ day World Champion over 400 m , was in 2010 positive and 21 month was block@@ ed . &quot;
a means of penis enlargement was to be held responsible .
this year is 30 @-@ year @-@ old over 200 and 400 m of the fast@@ est man in the world .
&quot; I@@ wan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ fest , Belarus ) : probably hardly any ath@@ letes have been detected so many med@@ als . &quot;
&quot; so , T@@ ich@@ on his world titles from 2005 nine years later , after having been established testosterone d@@ oping . &quot;
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to also had Olympia @-@ Silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid @-@ Dop@@ ings and the EM @-@ Tit@@ le 2006 because of testosterone @-@ abuse .
&quot; the recorded Bronze Med@@ al of the Olympic Games 2008 , he received due to a judgment of the International Sport@@ Tribunal of the Tribunal . &quot;
&quot; with 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m it lies in the rank two of the world &apos;s list . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ u Hong Kong ( 20 km clo@@ ves , China ) : the world &apos;s c@@ lei@@ gh@@ in and Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin was only positive in May , but still may start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; at the 29 years old world championship , references to the intake of a botanical nutritional supplements found , the sper@@ re of the world @-@ anti @-@ d@@ oping @-@ Agentur WA@@ DA fell mild and ran already on 13th July . &quot;
Bom@@ ben@@ cking in Thailand - Austri@@ ans in@@ ju@@ red - Sever@@ al T@@ ote
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand st@@ ains with the woman in contact , said the speaker of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Frei@@ day@@ early . &quot;
&quot; they have suffered cutting and had been treated in hospital , but this could already leave it again . &quot;
your trip will be planned for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether by the other explo@@ sions on the holidays island Ph@@ u@@ ket , as well as in the southern cities Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ GA , Tran@@ ang N@@ GA , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ one also are also un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Education in this respect , with the local authorities , so Schn@@ ö@@ ll . &quot;
&quot; at about 200 kilometres south of the capital city of Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in were initially explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a quarter of two Bom@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; the police have been killed by police in accordance with police , and about 20 people have been in@@ ju@@ red , including the Austri@@ ans , three German , three decline and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Fri@@ day@@ early went then again two spr@@ inkl@@ ers , so according to the authorities another man was killed . &quot;
Ph@@ u@@ ket was also reported by Ph@@ u@@ ket in the morning an Bom@@ ben@@ explo@@ sion .
at the det@@ on@@ ation near the for a holiday popular seaside Bad@@ est@@ ran@@ ds Pat@@ ong was wo@@ und@@ ed to police information .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the southeast coast of the country then explo@@ ded another Bom@@ b that dead@@ ly fat@@ al .
the spr@@ int be according to the authorities in an emb@@ assy in front of the re@@ four of the coastal police in the air .
&quot; finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ GA and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ western coast as well as in Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on on the southeast coast several verses . &quot;
&quot; you go from a connection to the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called . &quot;
&quot; the Bom@@ ben@@ att@@ ent@@ ate carry the same manus@@ cript , &quot; said Ar@@ me@@ eg@@ ener@@ al Dan@@ ai crit@@ erion by journalists . &quot;
we go out that it is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack .
&quot; it is too early to express themselves to possible moti@@ ves - probably , however it is about the de@@ eds of Muslim reb@@ els . &quot;
&quot; Thai media wanted to recognise a pattern with the attacks , which is typical for the Bom@@ ben@@ att@@ ate mus@@ li@@ ant separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , the Thai police declared the attacks not in connection with the Islam@@ ist insur@@ rection , or with the international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ ot@@ age , restricted to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; said a speaker in Bangkok . &quot;
one is rather that the bom@@ bs of oppos@@ ites of the ruling military j@@ unt@@ a were laid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities would have been secrets in recent days in upcoming events in the south of the country - however , they don &apos;t have been informed about the exact time and the places were informed . &quot;
&quot; yet , be un@@ clear which group behind the attacks . &quot;
&quot; police declared their officials throughout the country , security around important government buildings as well as airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and am@@ us@@ ement district . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand there are always smaller bom@@ bs , but they are mostly not opposed to tourists . &quot;
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace which was used over the years of Thailand King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol AD@@ UL@@ Y@@ A@@ DE@@ J .
&quot; according to reason , the Austrian Ministry of bom@@ bs recommen@@ ds the Austrian Ministry of its homepage to provide the instructions of Thai Security authorities . &quot;
high Security risk ( security level 3 ) Ren@@ umer@@ ations for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ iw@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ p@@ kl@@ a and Pre@@ p@@ ah Vi@@ enti@@ ce and surroundings . &quot;
&quot; according to disputes between security forces and Muslim people , there is no necessary travel in these provinces . &quot;
increased security ris@@ iko ( security stage 2 ) Rem@@ ot@@ ations for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were booked within a few days after a contro@@ versi@@ al referendum on one of the military j@@ unt@@ a in the constitution .
this gives the military great influence over the years to come .
&quot; j@@ ta Chef and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ CH@@ A said , the bom@@ bs had been an attempt to gu@@ ardi@@ zed chaos while driving the country towards stability , an improvement of economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military unt@@ a , the 2014 after a phase blo@@ ody un@@ rest had taken power , keeps themselves up again to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , it has not succeeded in control the military for years now in the extreme south of the country @-@ being mus@@ li@@ ant reb@@ els into the handle . &quot;
there were more than 6@@ 500 people in the conflict were killed .
just a year ago in Bangkok has been killed in a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the blo@@ ody attack of the younger history of the country .
the right &quot; identity movement &quot; is under the visor of the Federal State for Constitu@@ tional protection .
&quot; according to several offices , the Constitu@@ tional Treaty also have placed the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see in the &apos; identity movement &apos; clu@@ es for aspir@@ ations against the fundamental democratic principles , &quot; said Constitu@@ ent Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin . &quot;
thus the confidence of other Islamic faith or from the Middle East in a extrem@@ ist way diff@@ am@@ ed .
that is why we are monitoring the movement as well .
&quot; the &quot; identity movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; mul@@ tic@@ ally @-@ W@@ ahn &quot; , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass &quot; &quot; and the &quot; loss of own identity by a foreign identity . &quot;
&quot; constitutional cl@@ amps in nine Länder - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Saxony , Saxony and Thuringia - observe the &quot; identity &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , his authority have to be closely coordinated with the shoul@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; groups such as the &apos; identity movement &apos; try to pick up their target audience , where it stands , &quot; said the Constitu@@ tional committee . &quot;
&quot; in general , extrem@@ ists , they were talking with youth@@ ful language , often with p@@ opp@@ ed music . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ists as well as legal extrem@@ ists . &quot;
this is not a bet@@ on advertising for your own cause .
the propag@@ anda should speak the people emotional .
young people are thus sus@@ cep@@ tible in a special way .
this is dangerous .
&quot; finally , it had given reports from several federal states reports on contacts of the &quot; identity &quot; &quot; Af@@ lex politicians . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , he did not have knowledge . &quot;
&quot; for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this type is only relevant from a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it comes out whether the particular party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals , the extrem@@ ist , its target system changes and so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; therefore , therefore whether such persons controls the influence on the party . &quot;
this is not recogni@@ z@@ able .
&quot; with a view of the significant increase in legally fourth , and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugees said , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak of a new right terrorism in this context . &quot;
but we have observed in recent years that there may be legal structures .
there were the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ t@@ aler Group .
it can be quite well that further legal group@@ ings or small@@ groups form the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers or attacks against asylum seek@@ ers or attacks from other legal moti@@ fs .
&quot; but a long @-@ wide or European control of law@@ ns is not recogni@@ z@@ able , but not recogni@@ z@@ able . &quot;
the previous groups were built on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; express themselves , Ma@@ ate that many over@@ gri@@ ps went to the account of people who were not joined in the right scene in the right scene . &quot;
this is the wor@@ rying .
many of the Tat@@ verd@@ ant in attacks on asylum seek@@ ers were not known as criminal , politically motivated perpet@@ rators or suppor@@ ters of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; many people have committed criminal off@@ ences that were previously made with legal extrem@@ ists even nothing at the hat , which were perhaps politically indiffer@@ ent or for example CD@@ U , SPD or Lin@@ ke have been radic@@ alised themselves . &quot;

&quot; in the Aqu@@ atics Center fluctu@@ ating the slightly over@@ weight swimm@@ ers from Ethiopia , so slowly that he was no longer seen in the TV pictures . &quot;
it just disappeared - no matter how far the excerpt was selected .
in the social networks he was subsequently sent to the vi@@ ral Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old with a return of 48 seconds ended up and animated the 59@@ th place of 59 rounds . &quot;
&quot; but it was rather his not just spor@@ ty figure , which moved the attention of international media attention . &quot;
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates at the Olympic Games ?
the Ethi@@ op@@ ians got a special start@@ up of the international swimming @-@ association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ lined countries .

compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .

Fr@@ ene@@ tic was launched in M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i at that time .

&quot; fees per cu@@ bic meters of waste water is from 1 October 2016 for the area of the se@@ wage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch 3,@@ 44 instead of 2,@@ 10 Euro ; for Z@@ ult@@ enberg / Lind@@ enberg / Lop@@ p 3,@@ 36 Euro ( now 2,@@ 18 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro . &quot;
&quot; at the installation in Az@@ endorf , the wast@@ ew@@ ater fee will then continue to increase , if appropriate correction measures will be necessary . &quot;
after a whol@@ ly calculation of the ab@@ ide price in Az@@ endorf then lie at 4,@@ 37 Euros per cu@@ bic meters . &quot;
&quot; as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ farm@@ houses ( C@@ SU ) reported , was observed in the approval of the budget by the Land@@ rat@@ ory Kul@@ mb@@ ach , that for these wast@@ ew@@ ater arrangements stays . &quot;
the market kas@@ endorf is committed to legal principles to operate the plants .
&quot; from 1 October 2016 , the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ ud , Lind@@ enberg , and Z@@ ult@@ enberg deeper into the wall@@ et . &quot;
construction measures are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; how administrative manager Herbert Schmidt showed the Panel was necessary , a re@@ dem@@ ulation of fees for the wast@@ ew@@ ater treatment of the market is necessary . &quot;
&quot; in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , they also be survi@@ vor@@ s and sub @-@ covers from the previous calendar period . &quot;
&quot; the engra@@ v@@ ings decre@@ ases , so that it is equipped with all three wast@@ ew@@ ater treatment around relatively small facilities with a very small waste water he@@ els , between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cu@@ bic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; thus , due to the low distribution principle , for example expenses for the necessary repairs of several thousands of euro have a serious impact . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the wast@@ ew@@ ater will be easily revers@@ ed in all three plants . &quot;
&quot; continue to be in the back@@ sliding period in all three plants , not least due to their age and repairs in a significant extent . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf be almost 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ sch , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth , as well as Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Lind@@ enberg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt dism@@ is@@ sed that in the se@@ wage of Az@@ endorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be ex@@ changed due to a damage .
&quot; in the pump@@ ing space where nearly 20 years old conveyor belts had to be transferred from the ground and in the pond @-@ rank@@ y Lop@@ p had to be extended after nearly 20 years , the first cl@@ ergy and an additional ventil@@ ator can be installed in order to keep the water legal requirements even in the future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; for this extraordinary expenditure the continued insp@@ ections and maintenance costs , which are necessary to take into account in the new calendar period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs which during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 are still under the current level .
stone houses made clear that at the low waste water fall into the three facilities the expendi@@ tures for operation and maintenance .
&quot; in this , it is , suppl@@ ying suppl@@ ying Schmidt , the market place of large entertainment costs in the se@@ wage plant in the last 20 years . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the afor@@ ementioned systems will remain prec@@ ari@@ ous after viewing of stone houses on duration , especially if one could not extend the supply of the se@@ wage purposes of Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al to this plants , because it is about de@@ fic@@ ary facilities . &quot;

annual average level of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.3 % .

Snap@@ chat &quot; Anim@@ e &quot; effect as Asi@@ atic car@@ ic@@ ature cri@@ tici@@ zed
&quot; Snap@@ chat says that this filter anim@@ e is inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is in@@ sensi@@ ble toward bre@@ eds . &quot;
&quot; with its filter tool it allows Snap@@ chat about 150 million daily utens@@ ils , to change the reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that is already absur@@ d . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Ro@@ y Licht@@ enstein paintings . &quot;
&quot; the filters are un@@ flower@@ ing , peculi@@ ar @-@ rot@@ ating tools , which generate more than 30 million per day per day . &quot;
all mis@@ appear@@ ances will come to the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have tr@@ acted in the past criticism in which they were acc@@ used to act the app of Black@@ face @-@ dere or white skin as beauty @-@ deal .
&quot; when this week was proposed a filter for a filter , which gave them batt@@ ling , false teeth and no@@ zzle w@@ angen there were there some cri@@ tics a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; . &quot; &quot;
they ques@@ tioned whether this repeti@@ tive cont@@ ours is assigned to a greater problem that the company has with diversity .
&quot; the news and the sens@@ ation were widespread in Wednesday , with reports of The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat mitt@@ edly , that it would have been disabled . &quot;
the company offered an exc@@ use : the filter was meant as hom@@ age to Anim@@ e @-@ characters and not meant as cartoon by Asi@@ ans .
&quot; however , out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced vig@@ or@@ cism , re@@ minded of the filters in infring@@ ement of ch@@ isch@@ ees . &quot;
others secured the anim@@ e @-@ comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail wrote Gra@@ ce Spar@@ apan@@ i , a Korean @-@ American art @-@ student , whose per@@ missions were widely spread over the photos that the filter was &quot; vulnerable and succeeded . &quot;
they added that it was difficult to ar@@ gue with the counter@@ part of a very durable Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not secured , but that the terrain is drawn into the sec@@ lu@@ ded extreme . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that cros@@ ses these cultural Stol@@ er .
&quot; American culture seems to be engaged in an endless sealing and integration of integration , from conference rooms up to Hollywood and the devices that we are all in hand . &quot;
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people - who are in terms of race different than their older counter@@ players - could go more of it to expect sensitivity .
&quot; if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats Fil@@ ters have created a picture that is bot@@ her@@ ed for a user so it &apos;s much harder that such things was un@@ noticed when it was formerly the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year Kati@@ e Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu , which works as product management and engineer for medium , you have Snap@@ chat account to delete other others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview she said that they think that raci@@ al @-@ related contro@@ vers@@ y can reflect a lack of di@@ ity at the adjustments process . &quot;
Z@@ hu cri@@ tici@@ zed the great part white , only male leadership and ended their attachment with an has@@ ht@@ ag : # Del@@ ete@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no various representation of people with other skin colors in their work@@ force , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions where they are safe or well @-@ feeling to what it comes to say . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint , the snap@@ chat has mostly un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish numbers for the diversity of its employees and points to his status as a priv@@ ately @-@ owned company .
&quot; on Thursday , it Snap@@ chat starting to discuss the cultural back@@ grounds of its employees , but according to a speaker , the company has recently set up a HR responsible entity , which focused on sub@@ mits population groups and in internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu said , in turn , that they will leave their snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I ask myself whether they need more users like us to say that that is not . &quot;
military se@@ ven@@ ed IS@@ IS secret information that sets the committee of Congress
&quot; military nation@@ alities of the United States Central Command changed news @-@ related information to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so called Islam@@ ist state in Iraq and Syria , as it has allowed the actual conditions of Congress in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the provis@@ ional report , created by a Task Force of the Repub@@ li@@ can members of the dispute Committee , Secret Services Committee and the Wehr@@ bud@@ get@@ committee , reported of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command secret analy@@ sts , reported how the proposed measures have been changed to the American efforts in the fight against Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; the Central Command , short C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in Tamp@@ a , Florida who controls the American military installations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; posted information , which were mail@@ ed by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Com@@ man@@ de@@ aler typically , marked regularly a positive image of the American efforts against terrorism than it has been allowed to have more positive than analyses of other news services , &quot; c@@ ited a time article . &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers will suffer from bad analyses our political leaders , Repub@@ li@@ can become a member of the Represent@@ atives , firm . &quot;
the leaders in the Cent@@ Com range up to the top tip of the organization .
the ten @-@ sided report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the education of Ira@@ qi Arm@@ ed For@@ ces .
&quot; although there is no direct reference to that government pointed out under Obama instructions to change the reports , how analy@@ sts themselves exposed to the pressure from their suburbs , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half @-@ year 2015 , many Central Command Press releases , statements and statements prior to the congress was clearly positive when it corresponds to the facts . &quot;
&quot; for example , Cent@@ Com has publicly announced that a military withdrawal of Mos@@ sul@@ s have already begun in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; mos@@ sul , second largest city of Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigation , so much clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Repub@@ li@@ an@@ ic convention of K@@ ans@@ as , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the leaders of Central Command has changed the new member of Central Command system to run the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot;
repub@@ lic@@ ans ri@@ ef@@ en the Task Force in life after them has been played that analy@@ sts are worried about the manip@@ ulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings during the investigation .
&quot; in addition , further investigation of Cent@@ Com reports are provided by the General Insp@@ ection of the Ministry of Defence in G@@ ange . &quot;
democratic members of the news Committee published on Thursday their own findings which coinci@@ de with some of the conclusions of the Repub@@ li@@ can Task Force .
&quot; during the years 2014 and 2015 the Cent@@ Com created a super@@ vis@@ ually limited process for creating social @-@ related issues to IS@@ IL and the Ira@@ qi security services , Member of the Represent@@ atives , Member of the Represent@@ atives Adam B. Shi@@ p , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; this process , so Mr. Shi@@ p , &quot; delay the release of social @-@ related reports , &quot; compens@@ ated the mor@@ ality among analy@@ sts and &quot; &quot; gave up little space for separate opinions . &quot;
&quot; but Mr. Shi@@ p and the Democrats have passed on , no notes to an intervention of the White House at Cent@@ Com analy@@ sts in terms of &quot; certain political opinion . &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the Congress of Congress was published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Beast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported by Er@@ mitt@@ lungen by the General Insp@@ ection of the Pent@@ agon , which were added to complaints from Cent@@ Com analy@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; L@@ t. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ y of the Pent@@ agon , gave in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not be reports of Congress , while the investigation of the Convention was still in G@@ ange . &quot;
&quot; but he also gave us that &quot; experts sometimes have quite di@@ verg@@ ent opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence gave a contro@@ vers@@ y discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
&quot; on the question of a successful avi@@ ation campaign conducted on American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion , which is now made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the acc@@ us@@ ations of the past year , however , the issue has raised the question , how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest and military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crises regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism regarding the Islam@@ ist state recall more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker at the recommendations of many analy@@ sts , the recommendations of many analy@@ sts in Iraq , and had little time to wo@@ und@@ ed out about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 thoughts . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in insur@@ rection against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the Team at Mr. Hoo@@ ker continues to mention the government &apos;s statements against the Islamic state assumed that the provis@@ ional state had suffered on the financial situation of the terror group , since these provis@@ ional refin@@ eries had taken into operation , to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this knowledge was not released , reported the Times in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ coms 1,9@@ I commands , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was cri@@ tici@@ zed by members of the legislative due to its super@@ vis@@ e positive assessment of the war crimes during a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin went to retirement in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the US win two match in the field &apos;s field of women , a show@@ down with great Britain before proce@@ eding . &quot;
&quot; one day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 seal about Japan , Kati@@ e B@@ am also made the first two doors for the American field@@ Sk@@ ey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans with 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) , they could not remember it ever . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I am not belonging to the people who keep their gates in mind .
&quot; however , that knows the Americans at 4 @-@ 0 in the winter competitions and are equal in their group with the British in the first place , which remain un@@ be@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will encounter on Saturday in the last game of the first lap .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which both within their group of six teams will gain first and second place . &quot;
the first prize will take a little longer out of the path that the other group will lead .
&quot; as always the game run on Saturday , the Americans have trig@@ gered a surprising vor@@ tices through their success story , four years after she land@@ ed over the last London Games on the last of 12 places . &quot;
B@@ AM was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years ( her two older sisters have played the sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became nation@@ alists in the U.S. , the youn@@ gest in the history of the team . &quot;
she missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 because it was not able to qualify for the cad@@ re .
then the year 2012 came in which for her and her team went wrong .
&quot; in the next year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , a English , coach of the National team , and therefore the things began to get better . &quot;
&quot; a cultural exchange , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the working track in London that we now have .
we have done the rest of the complete .
on Thurs@@ day@@ time B@@ am opened the Tor@@ ri@@ gen in the first half of the game with a back@@ drop from the local area .
&quot; India was gone without victory in the tournament in the game , but the team did surprisingly tough and held the play of 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarters , till the game took into her hands . &quot;
&quot; it carried out a spr@@ int with the flat side over the left side , then moved into the middle and up@@ stream the ball into the gate around the Americans have a 2 @-@ 0 leadership . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ zal@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the door@@ ke@@ e@@ pers of the USA , Jackie Brig@@ gs , which each had to book one gate into each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
just as B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the pl@@ ague of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , how late it is , there are the Olympic Games . &quot;
the events in Rio de Janeiro are being resistant and in@@ escap@@ able to a rapid run between competition and quest .
&quot; it is , as if the olymp@@ ic F@@ ack@@ el itself is a burning stack , from the Cross@@ bow@@ men to protect the flo@@ ck to the tri@@ pod . &quot;
&quot; you can not lock the TV , read a paper or listen to the conversation of your neighb@@ ors in the queue in the coff@@ ees , without saying about Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Kati@@ e Le@@ er or the battle between Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then we are still Log@@ an D@@ ool@@ ey .
&quot; D@@ ool@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women warm with dim@@ ples , could have been posted among these known names , constructed to the Prime Time , constructed by sponsors and well @-@ using TV advertising , if he would be a swimm@@ ers , Tur@@ ner or even more real . &quot;
&quot; but D@@ ool@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fighting in the Olympic trampoline for gold . &quot;
the olymp@@ ic flame does not illumin@@ ated every event .
&quot; further from the center , partly in the shade are the sport @-@ types that are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ol , Archery , Bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast@@ stroke and would like to rule it long for a long time .
&quot; but if I would like to make arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the disc@@ rete charm of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the trampoline has already ski@@ p a Olympic event since 2000 , when it had been in Sydney when there was the last 16 years that many who I asked , I did not know that there is at all a Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ art . &quot;
this could also be regional ignor@@ ance .
&quot; although the USA Ath@@ l@@ eten a competition , there has never been a med@@ al in the trampoline and had until 2012 had made a ath@@ letes , who has made up to the end . &quot;
the Chinese and the Rus@@ sians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the can@@ adi@@ ans to share the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold med@@ al from London this year .
&quot; the jumping mat has a certain bo@@ city @-@ char@@ me , partly because it sounds for the un@@ resolved ear for a c@@ lown@@ fish as those for the Olympic Games sounds . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I should ad@@ mit that I am not an expert but only a re@@ born enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has humor@@ ous potential - a cart@@ o@@ y trem@@ bling of his never to end gri@@ ps , but also the refin@@ ement and dive , which combines two sports , which is essentially united . &quot;
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tr@@ ampoline by what so much means as &quot; spring@@ board . &quot;
&quot; emerging vic@@ tors jump on a gigan@@ tic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( rot@@ ating , lifting and sal@@ tos ) before they land on your feet . &quot;
&quot; you are assessed according to the official Olympi@@ ap@@ ro@@ gram according to execution , difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; secondary ath@@ letes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , are going to compete in Rio . &quot;
the most common olymp@@ ic v@@ ector is straight .
&quot; med@@ alli@@ sts must continue in their quest for gold , faster , up@@ wards and above , sometimes until the finish , sometimes , and back , up@@ wards and down@@ wards on the playground . &quot;
&quot; not only the Zi@@ ell@@ in@@ ie or the starting point , but in the television transfer also another height : the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ords . &quot;
&quot; the goal @-@ oriented pursuit is no@@ bel , ad@@ mir@@ able , even fan@@ atic and it &apos;s enough to even stir@@ ring a spect@@ ators to t@@ ears . &quot;
but it is also what I feel when you look at this games as something exhau@@ sted .
&quot; of which , the trampoline offers an at@@ emp@@ ire . &quot;
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a pr@@ el@@ ude movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she pr@@ all@@ t , seem@@ ingly weight@@ less like a ast@@ ron@@ aut , go up , then down@@ wards , then effort@@ lessly back to the top . &quot;
&quot; there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no h@@ ec@@ tic attack on the goal , not a wol@@ ves into the distance , just the dream , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games only .
&quot; the qualification and ends of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in the stre@@ aming around 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also around 13.00 . &quot;
N@@ BC the duck takes place as part of a after@@ no@@ ons on both days from 14.00 .
&quot; in the midst of Olympia Man@@ ia , they promise a peaceful , nice moment , one that is likely to be over@@ looked in general tum@@ ult . &quot;
if the consci@@ ous@@ nesses can only be achieved through the anxiety and the object of male Ath@@ l@@ ete - as it &apos;s the male US @-@ Tur@@ ner according to The Wall Street Journal recently forward to Mr. D@@ ool@@ ey his after air ring@@ ing new Fan@@ atic .
&quot; a generation prot@@ est &quot; in Ethiopia , Long is a mer@@ ger of the USA

Ethiopia is straight to break with me ?
&quot; during the last ten years , it was one of the stable countries of Africa , a solid ground@@ ing of West with a fast growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but in the past few months , protests against the government and spread themselves into ever more areas in the past few months . &quot;
last week thre@@ aten thousands of people on the streets and slow@@ ed fundamental political changes .
the response of the government was un@@ bar@@ red according to human rights organizations .
witnesses took on that polic@@ emen at zig un@@ armed prot@@ esters were p@@ oured and kill .
&quot; in the run @-@ sensitive videos about the protests , probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how safety men will show young people with st@@ aves , while they were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall . &quot;
the Chief of the UN Authority for Human Rights is now calling for an in@@ coming investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to stick to this country and even more difficult , it said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is estimated to Nigeria the most complete land of Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopia , to fight terrorism across the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western help . &quot;
Ethiopia Economy is expanding at the respect@@ able pace .
his infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new player in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ eba .
the roads are usually quiet and clean and clean .
&quot; even though Ethiopia , everything else as a role model for democracy - human rights organizations have continually led the op@@ pression by the government - the opposition in the country became restricted , with pres@@ idents effectively have been effective for silence . &quot;
&quot; many were sent to ex@@ ile or into prison , killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert . &quot;
but this could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ose people and these no other options have except to prot@@ est , breaks it off , &quot; said Sey@@ ou@@ m Tes@@ home , a lec@@ turer in central Ethi@@ op@@ ian . &quot;
the entire youth prot@@ est .
one generation pro@@ claimed .
there are numerous complaints that everything from soil utilization to cover up to the cover ) cover in terms of power of the Reg@@ ul@@ ing coalition .
&quot; after a long @-@ provis@@ ional election last year received the ruling party and its allies in the last seat of the opposition , and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the tensions along the border to Eritrea ; a battle for this z@@ ack@@ y , contro@@ versi@@ al line called for in June hundreds of lives . &quot;
&quot; analy@@ st advoc@@ ate that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the Oro@@ mo @-@ liber@@ alisation Front or the National liberation of O@@ g@@ aden , who were more or less forced to protect the turbul@@ ence over the past few years . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of before himself hal@@ ted in the surface now explo@@ de .
the first seems harm@@ less : smartphones .
&quot; only during the last few years , many Ethiopia has been able to communicate with the social media , as cheap smartphones were more common and improved the Internet services improved . &quot;
&quot; even if the government uses the access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , does many people still communicate over internet @-@ pro@@ x@@ ies , which hide it where they stopped . &quot;
several young Ethiopia said that they gathered themselves to protests .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity among the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ics in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; for e@@ ons of prosper@@ ous the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia , in politics and economy , while keeping the Oro@@ mos , some of which are many Muslims and living in flat areas . &quot;
but even this is changing just .
&quot; we are here , under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests found in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Nar@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have domin@@ ates that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which domin@@ ates around 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military , in the secret services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr Mel@@ es , a former rebel@@ lion , was up to his death in a non @-@ pub@@ li@@ ous disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia . &quot;
&quot; he was regarded as tac@@ tical gen@@ ius , a man who could think about corners . &quot;
analy@@ sts say that he was especially addressed to use early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and special officers to edit opponents and make them un@@ harmful .
&quot; the current regime is lacking in this fundamental cre@@ ature , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethi@@ op@@ ian new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen from relatively und@@ ed reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike the Lord Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray Region North of Slovenia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south . &quot;
analy@@ sts say that he did not enjoy the confidence of the tig@@ ray controlled security services .
many fear that the outcome will be more blo@@ od@@ shed .
&quot; the last time that Ethiopia had such a rebel@@ lion was in 2005 , after thousands of elections prot@@ ested that according to the information of analy@@ zers seem@@ ingly dominated by the government and subsequently st@@ olen . &quot;
&quot; while the subsequent raid were killed many prot@@ esters , even if there were fewer than in the past months , and this time of un@@ rest became relatively fast over the past few months . &quot;
&quot; the Ethi@@ op@@ ian leaders of the Ethi@@ op@@ ian leaders for their vision@@ ary infra@@ structural planning , as well as the new p@@ end@@ ler@@ fication , as well as for their meas@@ urable advances in poverty @-@ fighting drugs . &quot;
but obviously this does not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal failure of the Ethi@@ op@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous form of ethnic form .
&quot; last month of gri@@ ps abo@@ om@@ ination in G@@ ond@@ ar , a am@@ har@@ ian city , by Tig@@ ray guided shops and the hat@@ red opposite the Tig@@ ray is always busy in social media . &quot;
analy@@ sts say that protests and other Western allies put into a peculi@@ ar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ ders about the neighboring Somalia , even if they had recently re@@ eil@@ ed that it has closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West also wants to support democracy , he will not want to merge his allies in a already vol@@ ati@@ len area . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; is a very thin gr@@ asp . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp explains his argument Obama was founded IS@@ IS was &quot; Sar@@ kas@@ mus &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tru@@ mp tried to sc@@ atter the last contro@@ vers@@ y on Friday the last contro@@ vers@@ y , elected his campaign , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the Terr@@ organ of Islamic State , not seriously . &quot;
these clari@@ fy new questions about the communication skills of the presidential system of repub@@ lic@@ ans whether he is able to communicate clearly and understand@@ able with the American public .
&quot; it also brings together his compassion , who make efforts to take him during an un@@ event@@ ful phase in protection , to explain to the peculi@@ ar position , statements which he could not be meant . &quot;
&quot; after having had the clari@@ fication of an elect@@ oral event on Wednesday evening , recently Mr. Tru@@ mp was made in terms of the asser@@ tion on Thursday and consi@@ sted in interviews that he really did not intend to concei@@ ve the President and Mrs. Clinton had been created . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning Twe@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp , he is simply s@@ ark@@ astic . &quot;
&quot; the Twe@@ et was the opposite to the previous day , where Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a series of interviews , he said the exc@@ use completely seriously . &quot;
&quot; as the conserv@@ ative radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hug@@ h He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tru@@ mp would help to weak@@ en the statement somewhat weak@@ en , that Mr. Obama wanted to destroy it , the Repub@@ li@@ can pres@@ idency did not know anything of it . &quot;
&quot; the last storm of criticism of pr@@ as@@ selt on Mr. Tru@@ mp , while he tries to direct the focus of his campaign for falling uph@@ e@@ tion on the economic situation . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton had held speeches on the economic situation in Michigan in this week .
&quot; on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp tried to return to this subject . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter , he war@@ ned that Mrs. Clin@@ t proposals were to higher taxes on higher taxes and that he found their speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already carried out sar@@ cas@@ m already to its defense .
&quot; at the end of July he moved strong criticism to himself as he said , the Rus@@ sians should h@@ ug@@ ly Mrs. Clin@@ t em@@ ails , but said he later &quot; Nat@@ ür@@ lich I said that sar@@ cas@@ tically . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp allowed to move your lingu@@ istic limits to politics and then return to ru@@ ders .
&quot; I think it &apos;s been one of his methods to test how certain messages can be absor@@ bed by his fans , as they arrive , and then if necessary &quot; &quot; said &quot; &quot; said R@@ uth Sher@@ man , a Kommunikation@@ sl@@ ist who observed the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I also believe , he is clever enough to hold his statements v@@ ague enough , so that they can be interpreted in various ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of resol@@ ving the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tru@@ mp has assumed an additional sound , since its fr@@ age@@ ous values have continued . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist who was published on Friday , showed a guided tour to the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ on @-@ head @-@ race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tru@@ mp , generally tries to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ al statements , he asked his cri@@ tics frequently , his statements to dist@@ ort or his humor . &quot;
&quot; but while he is intensi@@ fied in focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s Scher@@ ze have brought his lo@@ y@@ als compassion into the un@@ convenient situation to him , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ant his statements also may be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mp@@ s most prominent inter@@ fac@@ ets , gave himself great effort to defend the candidates today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday to defend . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says is legi@@ timate , political comments &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani said to the correctness of Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had been founded to the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , little organization , he called it Hind@@ u , completely incorrect and so it happened because he moved the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most ma@@ instre@@ am Repub@@ li@@ ans attempt to ar@@ gue that the government served under Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton as an outside minist@@ erial , it &apos;s IS@@ IS permitted to break down the situation in the Middle East ag@@ gressi@@ vely under control . &quot;
&quot; before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and cast them to him on each of his words . &quot;
&quot; he temp@@ ted the &quot; poor , j@@ äm@@ mer@@ ly &quot; television expert , who try to understand him and said , &quot; you cannot ! &quot;
some of the Democrats pot@@ ted over Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s exc@@ use as a further proof that he was not suitable for the pres@@ idency .
once over the price of the market there is café in green@@ point back
&quot; ver@@ b Cafe was a sh@@ ari@@ al café in William@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash that no Wi @-@ Fi had for this but 15 years of good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices from its Bed@@ ford Avenue will be pushed onto the front . &quot;
&quot; the business So@@ ap Cher@@ ie , the Ver@@ b in Summer 2014 was sold , sold soap in the form of C@@ up@@ cakes . &quot;
local alleg@@ ed it as the last loss in a poor town .
&quot; the artist of Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I can still not believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea hotel is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is now a soap shop . &quot;
&quot; but when New York change is , it is also new in@@ vention . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ ward ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ year @-@ old staff of the old cafés , the owner and managing director of the new cafes . &quot;
he began to work in 2001 at Ver@@ b and remained there until the end .
&quot; when he provided a customer to provide money for a new out@@ break , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same Distri@@ but@@ or for the bag@@ els the same w@@ res@@ som@@ et model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old ver@@ b .
but Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez said that he also wanted to experim@@ ent .
he led new ingredients .
on the menu are sand@@ wich@@ es with b@@ acon and cheese and there are Gar@@ ni@@ sts such as KA@@ Per@@ n and aci@@ fied onions .
there are natural stri@@ kes .
&quot; the café serves not a beer more , for this there is fresh s@@ ts . &quot;
after nine months Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez said that he noticed a static current to old tribe .
&quot; many old customers were also pushed by prices from William@@ sburg , he said . &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was one such a customer .
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in William@@ sburg and visited the Ver@@ b regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after they had moved to green@@ point , she would take the path to himself . &quot;
&quot; after the ver@@ b closed , they gave them a while the coffee table , she said . &quot;
&quot; I was clear that it was on the coffee and at the culture in the ver@@ b that came to me , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now they drink coffee , even if they ordered at this day instead of their usual I@@ ced Coff@@ ees a Bl@@ ended C@@ hai Tea ordered , which is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a further long@@ time for the beginning of the competition in 2003 .
he went there before the work and ordered the same as the same .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket . and they prepare my Every@@ thing dre@@ el with but@@ ter , he said . &quot;
&quot; photo Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez said , he wanted to experim@@ ent and add new ingredients to the menu . &quot;
&quot; nowadays Ros@@ enthal gets still his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Bag@@ el with b@@ acon , egg and cheese . &quot;
Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez said that he did not have a Gro@@ ll that the soap store the old business room .
&quot; actually offered the owners of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie , a special soap for ver@@ b with the cold coffee of the coffee as an ingredi@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go on their offer , &quot; said Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have the café also accepted . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu into pol@@ ish and Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez said that he has to present them soon , so that his new neighbours feel welcome . &quot;
the site also has further advantages .
a local Saf@@ t@@ locally wants to fill the cold coffee into the bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the café is expanding on a dis@@ advantaged building .
for many customers a new verses is sufficient to get their old favorites .
Joseph W@@ itt was gathering and said that he was destroyed on the ground as the café closed .
&quot; as the new café opened , Wh@@ ew that the beg@@ ining of the loc@@ als and the bri@@ cks have a new coffee like a home@@ coming . &quot;
&quot; I had to cra@@ ze it , &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing meal of the economic crisis in &quot; a abundant meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the President , Franklin Del@@ ano Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt , took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
as gour@@ mets had President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt a f@@ ai@@ ble for refined Del@@ ik@@ at@@ essen the Fif@@ th Avenue as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water @-@ tie soup .
its menu on this day was somewhat mod@@ est : stuff@@ ed eggs in Tom@@ at@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , pot@@ el@@ p@@ ü@@ ree and as des@@ sert a pl@@ ough@@ ing p@@ ud@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act culinary solidarity with passionate people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; your husband added Andrew Co@@ e , It was also a message to the Americans , as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both grocery histori@@ ans .
&quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; was told by the Chinese food in the USA , while Zi@@ egel@@ man told in her book &quot; 97 Orchard &quot; about living in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; their latest co @-@ operation , &quot; A decent meal &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag , illustr@@ ated the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they shown culinary solidarity , when they meet with a Re@@ porter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sand@@ wich shop for dinner , a small , schn@@ au@@ kel@@ los@@ ed Im@@ bis@@ s in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the market crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; brick , 54 , ordered a fresh mar@@ es@@ and@@ and@@ wich with Oli@@ v@@ enst@@ own@@ s , while co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with pot@@ ato pu@@ ree and vegetable . &quot;
&quot; as the Re@@ porter Hack@@ br@@ ats ordered , this was the pair of a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich food were very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
there were Erd@@ n@@ uss@@ bread , liver and beans . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredi@@ ent and something of their own which the ingredi@@ ent stret@@ ched .
imagine so many pe@@ anu@@ ts to eat that they serve them as a dinner .
Co@@ e gr@@ ins .
&quot; it must have placed in the stomach like B@@ lei , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , a All @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at @-@ buffet . &quot;
teams of women co@@ ils for male field@@ workers and it was served fresh@@ ly past@@ ed past@@ ete for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; there were the Americans who sent to hung@@ ering foods during the first world of World War . &quot; &quot; A Square &quot; &quot; stands out the ways with which the country went with it , no longer the sl@@ ender of land . &quot;
&quot; it was a time in the food for the Americans a central , a ten@@ ful topic was buried , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; just as an@@ ited was the new Bud@@ get@@ al : mysterious food such as Br@@ ote and K@@ asser@@ ol@@ len were re@@ confident , the K@@ asser@@ ol@@ le as &quot; wonderful kind , eating remains repeti@@ tive , as ch@@ efs un@@ appe@@ tiz@@ ing ingredients under a pre@@ m@@ ous sau@@ ce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by tal@@ ger@@ es dry .
&quot; meat , the years of the center of American cuisine was to become a rarely ser@@ fourth luxury . &quot;
peculi@@ ar mix@@ es have been proven , since a cal@@ orie and nour@@ ishing satisfaction of taste or even healthy cooking . &quot;
&quot; during their research for the book , which includes recipes , prepar@@ es Zi@@ egel@@ man a dish from this ep@@ och , b@@ aked onions with ground but@@ ter , too . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addi@@ tive at lunch &quot; , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ mann goes on : &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ anu@@ t but@@ ter and b@@ aked onions is not fit to one another .
it was typical for many of the house of business .
&quot; as never before or since then , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated household income - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , Head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 up to 1943 - the eating habits of the country of such . &quot;
&quot; by giving recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encourage women to become &quot; household items and the challenge , Pamp@@ er , such as cre@@ m@@ ical sp@@ ag@@ h@@ etti with car@@ rots in delicious meals , just to become . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Square &quot; &quot; is a festival of historic L@@ ecker@@ mann@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the reports on the response of the government to the hung@@ ering citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cakes @-@ food @-@ attitude . &quot;
&quot; while he has publicly lob@@ by@@ ed the simple I@@ owa farmers &quot; kitchen / kitchen , he has become like the one @-@ h@@ ay man of the world , to which he has become . &quot;
&quot; he mo@@ cked continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
he ate in a almost l@@ ed ice @-@ room and carried a tu@@ x@@ ol .
he was glori@@ ous .
&quot; President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt might have been committed to the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or him promp@@ ted him to stat@@ ure with his stomach . &quot;
&quot; as described in the book the an@@ throp@@ ern of a stew@@ ard , with no interest in flav@@ ours by Mrs. Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt , that the White House led the bor@@ ed food in Washington but also one of the most sw@@ est . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , with food , has been rejected , once the land came back on the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is on our continued focus on cal@@ ories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as science was applied to food . &quot;
the pair was better understood during writing the book the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ man @-@ mother @-@ in @-@ law - for example how they could not throw away foods .
&quot; she had a real fear of waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man re@@ minded themselves : &quot; &quot; you actually made people sick . &quot;
there was the di@@ co@@ di@@ arr@@ ho@@ y .
&quot; after the T@@ eller at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s devi@@ ated them , they went and co@@ e a des@@ sert which they home cooked at home : the pav@@ ement was served , the President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a nasty tri@@ ck , hum@@ ble Reci@@ pes a send name to miss . &quot;
&quot; there was no layer cream , just pl@@ au@@ men , somewhat fl@@ our , sugar , water and cinn@@ amon . &quot;
&quot; everyone emerg@@ es somewhat res@@ sp@@ oon in the fence , brown d@@ lib@@ ber . &quot;
surprisingly it is not bad .
co@@ e got three times a re@@ mix .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ tier@@ er he said to his wife , &quot; A few ch@@ opp@@ ed wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
at bom@@ bs attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : K@@ hal@@ ed Om@@ ar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : K@@ hal@@ ed Om@@ ar devoted his life to the people in Syria .
he ris@@ ky everything to save the life .
&quot; now , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is died by a fac@@ bom@@ b attack of the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; Om@@ ar was a member of the &quot; White Hel@@ mets , &quot; a civil protection group , which according to the image of the picture until almost 6@@ 0,000 people were saved . &quot;
29@@ 00 volunte@@ ers are putting their own lives on the game to educ@@ ate people from cer@@ eals houses and to make the first help in the war region .
they are the her@@ oes of the war in Syria .
Om@@ ar was the face of the group : a video of the civi@@ liz@@ ers who shows him at a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a cle@@ aring from the tru@@ mm@@ ers of a house in 2014 around the world .
it made the Sy@@ s to the shining tool@@ bar in the Gre@@ ys of the war .
&quot; however , as her@@ oes he has never seen himself , said to the picture : &quot; for me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I &apos;m trying to save lives , I think that God sees in me a mart@@ yr@@ s . &quot;
&quot; shortly before Om@@ ar himself lost an attack on victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ bar@@ ges in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter have attacked four fac@@ bom@@ bs above the Alz@@ adia district , one was filled with Ch@@ l@@ org@@ as . &quot;

Greenland : the oldest vert@@ eb@@ tier is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
x @-@ rays mostly come in winter to the surface .
this H@@ ai was allowed to go back to the sea after a study on board the ch@@ ateau S@@ anna .
he was born 16@@ 24 and swim with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
&quot; Greenland , only with 150 years of off@@ spring . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the Nor@@ dat@@ lan@@ ti@@ ks along the bottom of Nor@@ dat@@ lan@@ ti@@ ks , in an hour it comes on average of just 1,@@ 220 feet far . &quot;
&quot; only when it comes up , acceler@@ ates the five meters long animal at s@@ atte 2.7 km / h - and is half a speed , half as fast as a robot . &quot;
but this from long@@ itude of life seems to be a patent concept for a high age .
&quot; Juli@@ us Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the professional magazine &quot; Science &quot; at any rate of a Greenland @-@ shar@@ k , the 392 years old . &quot;
&quot; ins@@ an@@ ity , commented Alexander Sch@@ erb@@ lein of the Max @-@ Planck Institute for dem@@ ographic research in Rostock this li@@ fes@@ pan , which means to sp@@ ans a world ord . &quot;
&quot; though , the evolu@@ tion@@ ar@@ ologist is already long that Greenland @-@ ha@@ yst@@ ems are st@@ aged . &quot;
only missing the evidence .
&quot; Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie are difficult to observe , eventually they live above all in the ic@@ eberg before the thin pop@@ ulated co@@ asts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Sv@@ alb@@ ard . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they dive on the surface mostly in winter . &quot;
&quot; on the li@@ fest@@ y@@ les of Greenland , researchers know accordingly little . &quot;
&quot; your time lu@@ p@@ ent@@ emp@@ o Ma@@ ce , when they inter@@ s@@ bergen six animals with a transm@@ itter . &quot;
&quot; lo@@ ot , this shar@@ ks still make these hair : in the stomach of a animal found researchers the remains of a robot , another had spar@@ ked the p@@ ale b@@ ones of a young ice cream . &quot;
possibly j@@ agen they le@@ ep sleeping animals or pat@@ rou@@ ters on the bottom of the ic@@ eberg and are looking for Kad@@ aver that are out of higher water @-@ coating down .
&quot; Juli@@ us Niel@@ sen and his colleagues were examined 28 Greenland , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Sv@@ alb@@ ard as a wh@@ aling from the depth of Nor@@ dat@@ lan@@ ti@@ ks . &quot;
the smallest sp@@ ai was just 81 cm long while the largest 502 cen@@ tim@@ eters .
&quot; to identify the age of animals , analy@@ zed them with the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ method of the lin@@ eup of the hair . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eyel@@ ids already arises in front of the birth of the hair , which contained in it will no longer be renewed . &quot;
the two smallest hat@@ s had stri@@ king much carbon @-@ 14 in the line .
&quot; their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960@@ s , as a nuclear programme for greater quantities of this radio@@ active carbon off@@ s into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in which with 220 cen@@ tim@@ eters , the left of third animal included in contrast an low over@@ throw of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , it is likely to have celebrated his 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
all major Greenland in their lin@@ ers had normal carbon shaf@@ ts which arises through cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock showed an 493 cen@@ tim@@ eters in long gr@@ aceful @-@ shar@@ k an age of 335 years , during the record @-@ H@@ ai with 502 cen@@ tim@@ eters even 392 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Greenland @-@ female @-@ females only get off@@ spring if they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
&quot; now , the researchers of the length could arrange a age . &quot;
&quot; because of one of the animals with 392 cen@@ tim@@ eters , probably at the thres@@ hold to the sex stand and his old age was determined with 156 years , Greenland with the multip@@ lication obviously at least one @-@ half centuries time . &quot;
even this is also thir@@ sty for sp@@ inal animals at present .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live above all in extreme waters is no coinci@@ dence .
&quot; also the previous record holder , a 211 years old Gr@@ ön@@ gue , in whose b@@ acon at the N@@ eck a 120 years old Har@@ po@@ ise tip , was caught in front of Alaska . &quot;
due to the low temperatures often the organism of the living animals live on austerity .
it thus mature later - and operators slow .
&quot; in order to keep warm up in cold water , the animals are often very large . &quot;
&quot; because the volume grows much faster than its surface , characterized by the animal heat . &quot;
the heat loss of a gram is therefore much bigger than at a gram elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal thus lives more dangerous and should focus on as early as possible as many off@@ spring , the evolution of evolution . &quot;
a very big animal should invest more resources rather into a long life .

Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; the city on the Main has come to compete with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg the best opportunities from London abandoned jobs and companies . &quot;
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt am most from the Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the compet@@ ency of financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncert@@ ain , whether ATM houses continue to operate from London from financial stores throughout the EU . &quot;
for the so called EU Pass the approval has so far been granted to the UK .
this just use big US @-@ banks .
several banks have already announced jobs to shift jobs .
the lob@@ by@@ union &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; counts with 10000 new jobs at the Main bin@@ nen five years .
&quot; for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks of the euro@@ zone , as well as other important authorities such as European insurance company E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk of ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the organization for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) is its head@@ quar@@ tered but it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the emergency is important for banks , as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; Luxembourg heated a great fund industry , but also as Dublin in the infrastructure worse . &quot;
&quot; Frankfurt , thanks to the big airport significantly easier to reach . &quot;
distant points the city with slightly available book@@ stores .
&quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the Seine , the ten@@ ant for first @-@ class professionals , 50 percent higher than at the Main . &quot;
&quot; besides , Frankfurt provides a higher quality of life as the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure , as well as less crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of the company consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city to place seven , Luxembourg to place 19 , Dublin in place 33 and Paris at 37@@ th place . &quot;
&quot; even if quality of life is a question of the preferences : &quot; &quot; with his already strong position as a financial location for the European Single Market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors . &quot;
London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um &apos;s most important financial center in Europe .

&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to continue standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; &quot; Clin@@ tons of Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ hel@@ fer@@ in Jenni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; in a stark contrast , Donald Tru@@ mp hidden behind the wrong expres@@ sions and disc@@ ern with regard to his previous promise made his tax releases . &quot;
&quot; it is common for US presidential elections to publish its tax releases , although they are not obliged to do so because of the law . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have expressed as a reason for its ref@@ usal of control by the tax authorities . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clin@@ t elect@@ oral mar@@ es in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , in relation to the publication of the Presidency of the Democrats . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday she said Michael Coh@@ en , Tru@@ mp@@ s Special advis@@ er , to CN@@ N , that he would not allow Tru@@ mp to publish anything before the controls are not finished . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s Cri@@ tics , among other things also the Repub@@ li@@ can pres@@ idency of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already conf@@ ection@@ able questions regarding assets , its donations for prosper@@ ous organizations , his business@@ men and various other compounds arise , especially with Russia . &quot;
Clinton has already wat@@ ched already on the subject and published on Friday a video on the Internet in the high @-@ ranking of Repub@@ li@@ ans Tru@@ mp calls on his tax statement .
&quot; on Thursday , they talked to the topic also during a speech about the economy of Michigan . &quot;
&quot; he den@@ ies himself to do what any other presidential elections has done in recent decades and to publish his tax expl@@ aining them . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico has reported that Tru@@ mp has paid any or only very little taxes for two years , and a business journ@@ alist of the New York Times presented on Friday a number of tax hav@@ ens and audi@@ tors that might be the case that still might be the case . &quot;
federal control have become a topic in the election .
&quot; Clinton supports a regulation that is named after the Billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren , which would ensure that people the more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % . &quot;
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during a voting event for Hill@@ ary Clinton in the past week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka requested , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ ebed@@ gl@@ omer@@ ates here has his seat to ex@@ changed Tru@@ mp for a meeting on their tax releases . &quot;
&quot; he said , he was subj@@ ected to a tax ex@@ am of IR@@ S and Tru@@ mp &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; of the voters and not before the tax authorities . &quot;
Clin@@ t campaign launched in order to be published in 2007 until the year 2007 .

the first two steps include the illumin@@ ant of the elephant with a tor@@ ches and the blad@@ der in an horn .

&quot; a French director l@@ ends with Jewish roots with Jewish roots , after having betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had no Israeli pre @-@ choice since it had been challeng@@ ed by an employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann the author of the Hol@@ oc@@ aust@@ Documentation &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; let his hass@@ le at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by having an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the coun@@ table list of the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed in between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel rooms . &quot;
&quot; how is it in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel is eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ ink@@ si Bristol offers a way to choose Israel about its own call center . &quot;
&quot; following a statement , the director turned to the hotel &apos;s reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer that he received there , &quot; sho@@ cking him &quot; , &quot; how Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel staff said that the measure is a &quot; final decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
&quot; the reason behind it was , extingu@@ ish@@ ers in the director still more anger . &quot;
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arab@@ s , and they have demanded that the pres@@ election is deleted , the An@@ ders of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli amb@@ assador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov H@@ adas @-@ Chamber , this was a &quot; great shame &quot; , &quot; the South German newspaper . &quot;
we were in@@ ated by this event and troub@@ led .
this is really very embarrass@@ ing .
&quot; the fact that this is based in Germany in exactly this hotel chain , even greater shame . &quot;
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; , &quot; said the ministers . &quot;
the inci@@ dent rede@@ emed a fairly large reson@@ ance on the internet in which people make the whole a sc@@ andal .
some talked to the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that would have been given to the military requirements of Arabic guests . &quot;
&quot; ash@@ amed of you , &quot; was it in another post in which it pointed out that the hotel that is located at the no@@ zzle Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a Synago@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel proved quickly all the acc@@ us@@ ations of themselves and called the inci@@ dent , &quot; and &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports The mirror . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct assignment &quot; &quot; Israel not to add to the quick@@ er list , c@@ ited the South German newspaper an speaker of Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;

trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % at - RT Business
&quot; with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian Ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ary@@ an , the trade agreement between Moscow and T@@ ehr@@ an in the annual amount of 7@@ 0,@@ 9 per cent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran , the interest on the Russian companies grew strongly in stores in the country , divided the amb@@ assador . &quot;
&quot; Russian companies will take existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to get access to the market . &quot;
&quot; of course , the further commercial construction is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ary@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he noted that the trade agreement between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 by 7@@ 0,@@ 9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015 increase and $ 856 million . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the Russian imports of Iran grew by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and stressed $ 697 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran grew by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade @-@ turn was reached by deliveries of machines , land@@ vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the amb@@ assador . &quot;
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ary@@ an goes for this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
&quot; last year the Russian Federation has been around 35.@@ 000 Vis@@ as , first of travel vis@@ as , at the Irish citizens . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Iran reached the top 20 countries , which affects the tourist number in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record of Irish tourists in Russia of the last year , broken , &quot; said he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only relatively few Rus@@ sians Iran , something , of which the amb@@ assador hopes that it will change . &quot;
&quot; I personally recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ raz and Y@@ az@@ d , who received the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;

he returned this statement later and there was no obj@@ ection of England ri@@ vals .
&quot; in such a over@@ rag@@ ing victory , this time there was no such problem . &quot;
&quot; said : &quot; &quot; it feels with the whole GB flags at the Tri@@ b@@ ün@@ e like London . &quot;
we have come together in the last three months as a team .
&quot; we have come so bad@@ ly as many world titles as bad , that it was incredible , again at the Olympi@@ ad . &quot;
&quot; this is an event , a gold med@@ al for the nation , which were seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if that is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , that we expect a successful five days at the Vel@@ od@@ rom . &quot;
&quot; with the form of Kenn@@ ys , it is in the area of possible that he is winning a victory of three olymp@@ ic gold med@@ als in a competition . &quot;
&quot; this would be born for Kenn@@ y - who was born just 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on 23 March ( a apparently sacred date for UK sport ; on the day , Steve Red@@ dit , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster was born ) - a cle@@ ute of six gold@@ med@@ als and a silver med@@ al . &quot;
the ch@@ ari@@ ous of the tes@@ y equal .
&quot; identi@@ y takes part in the Spr@@ int , which starts today and will go over three days . &quot;
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels something lon@@ ely to win alone .
&quot; said : &quot; &quot; if he wins two further gold med@@ als , he should be be@@ aten to the k@@ nights . &quot;
&quot; it was the only med@@ alli@@ sts competition , but there were more good news for England . &quot;
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , St@@ even Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified himself with the fast@@ est performance in four @-@ four @-@ od@@ ometer . &quot;
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 12,@@ 42 at the destination . &quot;
&quot; the Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord , the 2012 won in London Gold , was at 3 : 5@@ 3,@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; today &apos;s first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will be in focus on the second day of competition . &quot;
he had shi@@ fted yesterday with officers in front of the qualification as being able to ri@@ ef@@ ish him to measure his body size .
&quot; in accordance with the Women &apos;s competition , the tomorrow continued and ended , av@@ anci@@ en Laura Tr@@ ott , Jo@@ anna Riv@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and Kati@@ e Archi@@ ve@@ e of Mil@@ ng@@ avi@@ e in World : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB team is ready for its strong railway team to domin@@ ate the medium period of the Olympic Games and to pick up a sh@@ ar on med@@ als .
&quot; following a truly exceptional presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were rund@@ own . &quot;
&quot; there was Dr@@ amas in the background , as the withdrawal of the technical body Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the midst of Sex@@ is@@ mus@@ - and Mob@@ b@@ ing@@ vor@@ es and retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , when one sees itself the first evening of the competition at the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite afterwards as the legend@@ ary reputation GB@@ s , who has reached its climax at the perfect moment . &quot;
the future of melt by Port@@ land due to the lifting of the energy order
&quot; the future of aluminum mel@@ ting by Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - are standing on the game , since the system operators termin@@ ate the energy contract for the energy contract and so that all delivery y@@ ields will be raised , such as the remote energy company . &quot;
&quot; this step followed by the decision of the Government at Victoria in the beginning of this year , no further subsi@@ dies to operate the plant . &quot;
one for 20 years old Sub@@ vention works in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the system of Alco@@ a in Port@@ land are on the game .
&quot; no less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indi@@ rect , could be endanger@@ ed at an closing time . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it could occur in Dom@@ ino@@ Effects since the melt is around 10 per cent of the total electricity generation Vict@@ ori@@ as . &quot;
2014 he concluded the Point Henry Schmel@@ zer@@ ei that led last year to an closing of the Angl@@ es@@ ea strength .
the melt by Chi@@ a in Port@@ land loses money and ris@@ ky an closure .
&quot; this step follows the long @-@ term spec@@ ulation with regard to the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australia Dollars and last due to the stra@@ w@@ ses to the system . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium windows with his lo@@ y Yang A power station in Lat@@ robe Valley , shared with that three other owners are termin@@ ated their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the facility is located in the majority of a joint venture of Chi@@ a and Al@@ um@@ ina , where the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Corp minor shares . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L goes to that the plant continues to be operated in Port@@ land , which means another physical demand for electricity through the melt &quot; , &quot; shared the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continues to have said that the Tre@@ aties called &quot; &quot; hed@@ ron &quot; &quot; which should have into effect from November 2016 . &quot;
the contracts have an 12 @-@ month period of cancellation , so that they will be end . &quot;
&quot; therefore , AG@@ L goes from that the Tre@@ aties will contribute to the revenues in the financial year 17 , &quot; said the power supply . &quot;
all potential impact on earnings on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently con@@ fin@@ ed by the forecasts of strong terminals for wholesale dates .
AG@@ L shared with that it has already written the value of the Tre@@ aties into the amount of $ 187 million in &quot; expect@@ ation of an dism@@ is@@ sal .
&quot; Alco@@ a said that the decision to book the agreements , the &quot; skill of Alco@@ as ... the enam@@ el to operate or to ensure the power supply to the mel@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. company said that it has concluded a 20 @-@ year treaty with Lo@@ y Yang , which is expected by November this year , even though it is still a statement guil@@ ty , why it has occurred from the contract . &quot;
analy@@ sts war@@ ns due to the poor economic conditions of the industry prior to possible closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near New@@ castle .
&quot; in reference to the statements of analy@@ sts in the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land every year around 600 meg@@ aw@@ at@@ ts and Tom@@ ago around 900 meg@@ aw@@ at@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; should both systems disappear from the market , this would mean considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; power market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as electricity producer , this would not be good , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; more than just a card@@ as@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue &quot;
&quot; th jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the card@@ inal and mother of the card@@ as@@ hi@@ an @-@ jen@@ ner C@@ lans Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September edition of the US Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; posted , the brand message from Est@@ ee Lau@@ der is and went to the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ agram account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , brought me the sight of this co@@ vers to wines , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot;
the un@@ v@@ eil@@ ing of the Co@@ vers followed a bizar@@ res ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the card@@ as@@ hi@@ an &apos;s family ? ) , the entire card@@ as@@ hi@@ an @-@ jen@@ ner family show ( except the problem of Rob Ry@@ an Se@@ ac@@ rest ) as they will finish the cover of her sister and ends with a classic turn : they all have a sur@@ prises . &quot;
&quot; this represents the cl@@ adding plot on almost any Birth@@ day of a child shipping ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the proposition , &quot; &quot; you had forgotten ? &quot; &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon by 8 am in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to take her other girls somehow at this publicity . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the September 4th of the Vo@@ gue , certainly has started a new era for the card@@ as@@ hi@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ alls big sister Kim I like what the Vo@@ gue cover cover , have be@@ aten ( they and her husband Can@@ ye West were shown in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a le@@ ague for itself . &quot;
the September edition is the most suitable edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
&quot; with a extent that res@@ em@@ bles rather an image as a mo@@ de@@ time , the output draws a large number of adverti@@ sers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were from the 8@@ 32 sides of the Bear@@ zer 615 pages advertising ) . &quot;
the revelation of his Cover@@ ings will be so seh@@ ood expected that during the last two years the magazine has passed on to the official announcement .
&quot; women who were already on the cover include Na@@ om@@ i Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; &quot; cour@@ ge &quot; , &quot; model@@ ing &quot; &quot; as &quot; Models , the celeb@@ rates are &quot; on the cover . &quot;
Oscar @-@ Prize for Jenni@@ fer Lawrence was 2013 on the cover that had a year after Lady G@@ aga the honor .
&quot; but even at the low chance that Mrs. jen@@ ner - that is described from the magazine as the &quot; &quot; gross model &quot; &quot; of its generation - among the earlier category it is located in good company . &quot;
&quot; these ten@@ ders are not related to famous individuals or Reality stars or young people from today , who know how to play a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if it is true of that it is true . ) &quot;
they are really talented women who are looking out in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Bey@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , was with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of their career . &quot;
of course J@@ enn@@ as did not like any success to everyone .
with their Reality @-@ TV history was always something ten@@ se in the fashion world .
in June he cri@@ tici@@ zed the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Model Step@@ han@@ ie Sey@@ m@@ our jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and called her &quot; the mist@@ ress of the Moment . &quot;
these feelings may be back high when the message with the show J@@ enn@@ ers came out on the Vo@@ gue cover .
&quot; but on the distr@@ ust , it seems to go along the point . &quot;
antonio jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of the word a super@@ model .
it works for Marc Jaco@@ bs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer from Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all their sisters will sell you pictures of their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
they sold from her painted pictures of C@@ indy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine LO@@ VE .
and in her spare time she is seen in Reality TV . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
community centers every year 16@@ 0.000 people from
&quot; more than 16@@ 0,000 of the aid @-@ dig@@ it of the country is rejected by the municipal Centers , while the sector has pushed forward to the impact of other central short@@ ings on already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Queens@@ land are already three of five people - mostly older persons , immig@@ rants , need@@ y workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ ere@@ ed Del@@ og@@ ging and similar ones - at their request for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already exc@@ eed@@ ingly outs@@ ourc@@ ed , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; from June next year , this legal centers will lose further 30 percent of their federal states . &quot;
&quot; the director of the municipal centers of Que@@ enst@@ ern James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of Joint Centers , that already thousands of people are rejected each year . &quot;
Far@@ rell said that the situation without lifting the decision of the federal government would only be worse .
&quot; Queens@@ land community centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means thousands of people of important services you need to be rejected , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave non @-@ violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and oppressed debt , families who have been kid@@ n@@ atives - all these people have problems legal way and this collection shows that they do not need the help they need . &quot;
&quot; the federal government will be the means by 30 percent in June 2017 , which means thousands of hil@@ s@@ need@@ ing people from Queens@@ land will be forced to justi@@ fy with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we call for the gener@@ osity and federal government ministers as well as the sen@@ ators of Queens@@ land George Bran@@ di to asc@@ end these mid @-@ short@@ ings immediately , so that people can get the help you need to get in legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the provin@@ cial government had their commitment to raise funds to the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now at the time to look at the needs of the community centers and its customers , as well as the government Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k will invest in this important work . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp elect@@ oral campaign after employees suppos@@ edly moved weapon
&quot; new York : Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign was charged because of inn@@ umer@@ able in@@ action , after it was shared that their struggle leader for North Carolina was directed to a employee when they were on the move in February in a je@@ ep . &quot;
&quot; the inci@@ dent will be described in an indic@@ t@@ ment , which was submitted by Vincent B@@ ord@@ ini by Vincent B@@ ord@@ ini , a former software program@@ er for the campaign in this federal state . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ord@@ ini gave to that monthly , that the matter would be regulated intern@@ ally before he realized that &quot; that would not happen . &quot;
&quot; the Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ manager , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; &quot; pul@@ led a pist@@ ol , put his right po@@ inter to the ab@@ duction , and r@@ amm@@ ed the run in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , called B@@ ord@@ ini in his acc@@ us@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; after having expressed himself in local and regional struggle line , B@@ ord@@ ini had fixed that at least four more people had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he gave to the indic@@ t@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be dism@@ is@@ sed to shift damage , &quot; B@@ ord@@ ini &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the indic@@ t@@ ment comes only two days after the Repub@@ li@@ can presidential elections , when he said a crowd in North Carolina that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; &quot; - Sch@@ uss@@ w@@ affen@@ bes@@ itzer , and ceas@@ e@@ fire - measures should be elected , if its Ri@@ val@@ ine Hill@@ ary Clinton should be elected and judge . &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign clearly demonstrated that the media had his words into the context and that he would not lead to violence .
Co@@ ordin@@ is complaint requires damages from the campaign for the violation of the duty cycle and by Philip because of body viol@@ ability and lead @-@ of harm .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before countries @-@ elections : SPD and CD@@ U loses
in the upcoming elections in the Bundes@@ länder Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) are significant losses for the ruling party SPD and CD@@ U .
this predic@@ tive surveys of the freedom of speech IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot;
&quot; while the red @-@ black government Co@@ alition on the north , it could not gover@@ n in Berlin , this is not possible after remo@@ vals in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both states , the SPD would have the strongest party and would have good opportunities to continue the government &apos;s government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD from 35,@@ 6 percent increased from five years to 24 per cent . &quot;
&quot; according to survey , the party should only be just under the CD@@ U that could come back to 23 percent again . &quot;
third place is contro@@ versi@@ al between the Left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left fighters on 19 percent ( previously 18,@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country . &quot;
the Gre@@ ens in spite of slight loss with 6 percent ( previously 8,@@ 7 percent ) again in the Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag . &quot;
N@@ p@@ d and F@@ DP were not represented by 3 percent in the country .
the SPD member of the survey comp@@ lies with the SPD of the survey only on 23 percent ( election in 2011 : 28,@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent to 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; they are still behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17,@@ 6 percent ) , but before left with 15 percent ( previously 11,@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the de@@ pu@@ ties .
&quot; by 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope to return the pir@@ ates , the pir@@ ates would be missed against it in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ mail and internet in time period : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator came onto the market .
the successor to domin@@ ate today the world - his maker lived a disaster .
the unit weigh@@ ed almost a half kil@@ ograms and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was di@@ cker and bigger , it was therefore not good in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was pretty kno@@ cked . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory was initially eight meg@@ aby@@ tes , which would be enough today for about two sel@@ dom with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gig@@ abyte .
&quot; the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; was released exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , in the business - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a couple of euros , lovers can still buy the devices on the internet , but they are somehow from the St@@ one@@ age of the dor@@ mit@@ ory age . &quot;
but 20 years ago the Communic@@ ator was a sens@@ ation .
the Finnish cell phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months previously on the computer @-@ fair CeBIT in Hanover as &quot; Office in the West @-@ format &quot; format .
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone was able to send a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , also by fax was the Communic@@ ator . &quot;
even access to web pages was possible by HTML browsers as well as qu@@ est@@ ing slowly .
a calcul@@ ator was available to a digital addres@@ book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small ant@@ enn@@ as and the mobile phone could work similar to a laptop .
then we found a small keyboard and a Black @-@ White screen .
&quot; pretty proud was the price : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , so about 1400 euros . &quot;
the average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was for 2015 at 392 euros .
nobody was able to start in August 1996 that the Communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
&quot; the clever phones are a success story , although not for Nokia . &quot;
the cell division of the fin@@ s lived an un@@ parall@@ eled disaster , was finally sold to Microsoft and handled . &quot;
&quot; today , the market domin@@ ate today , which came all much later than Nokia . &quot;
&quot; always and everywhere , this is today for a lot of people everyday life . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide . &quot;
&quot; sold around 1.4 billion devices , to Samsung and Apple falling to it alone 555 million pieces . &quot;
global sales of the devices is roughly 400 billion euros .
&quot; to this end , the well @-@ running shops of the numer@@ less app vend@@ or and telecommunications company . &quot;
around the smartphone has now been developed a whole industry .
&quot; the decisive break@@ through to mass market came only early 2007 , at that time Apple @-@ Chef Steve Jobs on the Mac @-@ World the introduction of the iPh@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; he spoke three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an internet communication , everything via Touch @-@ screen easily to use . &quot;
&quot; the winner of Apple began , the iPhone is the most important product of the Group . &quot;
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry that domin@@ ates the market had seen . &quot;
it finally disappeared to fight Black@@ berry .
the sc@@ ales now have Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung .
the Smartphone is a 20 years after its in@@ vention .
&quot; in the cut , each of the Germans are now looking for 88 times a day on his cell phone . &quot;
&quot; we all have to learn to cover the smartphone also time , &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in the Siemens Executive Board of Directors . &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a cur@@ se and blessing at the same time .
England must draw the olymp@@ ic Spirit and extend He@@ ath@@ row
&quot; He@@ ath@@ row will not only be in our local commun@@ es and throughout London , but throughout the country of renewal and prosperity . &quot;
&quot; for me that was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ rows , just as at that time in 2012 , when we run a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benef@@ ited from the games . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and we will reach that we will be able to create new possibilities for local resident and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; for our local communities , we have already been able to create new jobs , 4@@ 0,000 new jobs and prepare for youth unemployment within the airport . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of us in London , there will be such that the challenge of enlargement He@@ ath@@ rows is too big . &quot;
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we bl@@ ending us on the world stage .
the two @-@ fl@@ yers had gotten wrong with 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to over@@ coming but He@@ ath@@ row answers every question asked questions .
as the Olympic Games He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for single infra@@ structural project .
&quot; enlargement is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in wit@@ ty growth and leaving a legacy of skills and employment both to the airport as well as in whole GB . &quot;
&quot; we have chosen a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has been implemented a £ 11 billion of infra@@ structural investment in time and budget , from the T5 - the five years as a result of the world @-@ best airports that was built in the middle of the two frequ@@ ented races in the world . &quot;
&quot; now , they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investment . &quot;
the London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the extension of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
&quot; it is time that we draw this Olympic spirit and extend He@@ ath@@ row as well as our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment , to be proud of the England . &quot;

&quot; for companies that come with online @-@ advertising money come according to one of the soft house outputs , adverti@@ sers to handle , a &quot; &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook , the Ad@@ block Plus was block@@ ed , published Ad@@ block Plus an blog@@ mail , in which it had shared that users can update their filter in the program to block again advertising in the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook with that its desktop would change the coding on its advertisements in order to make it indication that part of the page advertising is to be revealed . &quot;
but Ad@@ block pro@@ claimed that there has found a new way to handle the new codes .
&quot; in a blog@@ post wrote the spok@@ es@@ person from Ad@@ block Ben Williams , that &quot; &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ H@@ er @-@ battle between the indic@@ t@@ ment open source community and has already been possible since the in@@ vention of advertising lock@@ ers in the swing , and that it is possible that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution . &quot;
&quot; the fact that the world &apos;s world &apos;s largest company has un@@ released into the fight , is a strong indic@@ ator for the industry become a strong indic@@ ator for the industry . &quot;
&quot; according to a study from the last year of Pag@@ ef@@ air , and Adobe approximately 200 million people dis@@ sol@@ it@@ ers ; nearly four times as much of 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1,@@ 03 billion daily active users , access to Facebook via its mobile devices , Hand@@ y@@ advertising 84 percent of the company impress from . &quot;
&quot; the company has based on ad block on desktop PCs , because mobile advertising block doesn &apos;t block any effect on fac@@ ebooks mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agram , shared a speaker . &quot;
&quot; advertising on Desktop PCs makes a sufficient large proportion of revenue , so that Facebook appears to be rewar@@ ded as rewar@@ ding as worth@@ while . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook with that it would be updated to update its &quot; &quot; display &quot; &quot; tool &quot; &quot; to put more control over it on them . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook , that ad@@ am@@ ination new filters were wor@@ rying , because they would also block the content on the side , which no advertising are . &quot;
&quot; for users this does not represent a positive experience , therefore we are planning to address the problem , shared an speaker from Facebook in an e @-@ mail communication . &quot;
&quot; adverti@@ sers are a st@@ unt means , which is why we instead focused on developers such as Ad Preferences , to put more control over the hands of the people . &quot;
Mrs. on susp@@ ected masturbation on Swiss highway floo@@ ding
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls witness to a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday at a susp@@ ected masturbation of several vehicles on a highway .
the inci@@ dent took place on the A1 near Morges in the Canton Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman placed himself in the dark On@@ es &quot; in an act of desp@@ air &quot; on the road and were taken by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a silence at the age of 49 years , which was by several vehicles , including a trucks , over@@ ride even death . &quot;
it died on site .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some are still not been identified , said the police that this as well as any witnesses of the inci@@ dent to report . &quot;
&quot; it was opened an investigation procedure , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter of the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gene@@ ve with . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to wait if one of the drivers will be displayed . &quot;
was a cl@@ ash avo@@ idable ?
&quot; that is something that the prosec@@ ut@@ or has to decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers cannot be held ac@@ coun@@ table .
&quot; in each of the two cases - when a person ran in the Dark On@@ es on the highway - was decided that the drivers will not assume that a ped@@ estri@@ ans runs at the night on the highway , as it was in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year was acqu@@ itted a polic@@ eman of the neg@@ lig@@ ent pot@@ ism after having had a man over@@ ride and killed , who was in August 2014 of a night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne . &quot;
the 22 @-@ year victims had tri@@ cky and has become un@@ conscious on the road and took the court .
&quot; the court set firmly that the polic@@ emen -- which arose on an emergency manner -- on a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the street a &quot; completely exceptional and un@@ predic@@ table situation &quot; was , said the judge . &quot;
&quot; everyone who has further information about the inci@@ dent on Thursday in the vicinity of Morges , should register with the police under the number 0@@ 21 644 83 46 or 0@@ 21 644 44 44 . &quot;

scientists at the Godd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies at NA@@ SA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms for those of climate research .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , waterproof surface and CO2 @-@ di@@ still@@ ed atmosphere once may have proved similar conditions once . &quot;
scientists have previously pointed out that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation indicates that the Venus had a thin , who could have had a thin @-@ similar atmosphere and still slowly re@@ bound . &quot;
the model also illumin@@ ated the top@@ ography of early Venus .
&quot; the planet was probably more dry areas than the earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to host life and before faster sus@@ pic@@ ion . &quot;
the early Venus also benef@@ ited from a sun that was 30 percent .
&quot; in the G@@ IS@@ S @-@ Modell@@ simulation ex@@ pon@@ ds the slow circum@@ ference of the Venus its di@@ pping of the sun nearly two months long , &quot; explained G@@ IS@@ S scientists Anthony D@@ el Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this heat the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which affects the surface of a large part of the solar water he@@ ater . &quot;
the result are average @-@ temperatures that are some degrees cooler than the Earth today .
the model brought a history of Venus that res@@ em@@ bles the evolution earlier by Plan@@ etary research .
&quot; although it was once probably inhabited , the Venus -- in the course of more billions years --@@ are exposed to a lot of heat and ult@@ ra@@ violet light . &quot;
their Oce@@ ans dou@@ bled and their water steam was burned from the ult@@ ra@@ violet light .
as their Hydro@@ gen un@@ wich remained only a thick atmosphere at carbon dioxide with a dead@@ ly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus Kli@@ mam@@ od@@ ells in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Ro@@ y go back as a trainer of Aval@@ an@@ che
&quot; Patrick Ro@@ y came back on Thursday as trainers and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che , and led to a little understanding in the decision making of the team . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and remember that the association will immediately be looking for a new coach . &quot;
&quot; in the last three years I have met my duties as a trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determin@@ at@@ eness , expressed itself the 50 @-@ year Ro@@ y in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; in the course of summer , I &apos;ve been thinking about how I could improve this team to give him more depth to give him more depth , and to bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations perfectly tailored to the organization . &quot;
he must also have a co @-@ determination in decisions which influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not fulfilled .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , the Ro@@ y on 23 May 2013 had attached to him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick has informed me today about this decision , &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we appreciate all what he did for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
Ro@@ y was distinguished during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of Jack Ad@@ ams Awards and the best coach of the League .
&quot; he led the association to 112 points and on the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was be@@ aten in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and passed in each of the two years the after@@ season . &quot;
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded in season 2015 @-@ 16 a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand and fell behind the Wild for a second Wild@@ Card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart won Ro@@ y four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the Aval@@ an@@ che .

&quot; strike against the oil field service provider Wood Group were conducted spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the Nord@@ see , which are operated by Royal Dutch Shell . &quot;
&quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and r@@ mt trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to start the ongoing process of current strike , it is in a common statement . &quot;
&quot; we will hold some full @-@ day sessions during the next weeks , start the beginning of next year to start the problems . &quot;
&quot; the trade unions said that their last strike , who is the first in over 25 years , a prot@@ est against possible wage short@@ ings of up to 30 percent be . &quot;
wood Group has decre@@ ased this year the r@@ ats to its contr@@ actor in the North @-@ see around 9 percent due to the negative market pressure .
the result of the company is followed by a 10 @-@ pro@@ mpt@@ ly decline for on@@ shore contr@@ actor in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts in the company gives the necessary space to get through the market down@@ turn .
&quot; shell has been announced for its part of thousands of people and announced plans to present its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , since its business activities have been ration@@ alized as a result of its Meg@@ az@@ um@@ dar@@ ing with the British energy company BG Group . &quot;
&quot; energy companies are under pressure due to lower raw materials under pressure , an economic situation that had increased by the decision of the British in June , the European Union had intensi@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; the Scottish parliament , Dave Ander@@ son met at the beginning of this week with workers &apos; leaders to discuss one of the greatest working disputes who had been held in the North Sea for a generation . &quot;
&quot; North Sea is important for regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy , which works for many and not just for a few &quot; , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; 2016 will be less than $ 1.4 billion on issues for new projects in the North Sea , compared to an average of about $ 7 billion in the past five years . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rot@@ ary rate of stars in the con@@ stell@@ ation of the P@@ lei@@ ades
&quot; the newest mission with Ke@@ pler Wel@@ traum@@ tel@@ esk@@ op has helped Astr@@ onom@@ ics , helped the complete catalogue of rot@@ ary rates among the stars of the observ@@ atory of the P@@ lei@@ ades . &quot;
&quot; the new data help the astronom@@ ers to understand why stars in the star enh@@ anc@@ ements to different types of vines , as well as in which it comes to the planning stages with the plan@@ etary development . &quot;
&quot; we hope that we have experienced by the understanding of our results with other ast@@ eries , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of its solar system , said Luisa Reb@@ ull , a resear@@ cher at the Cal@@ Tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the star@@ ring of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 445 light @-@ years of Earth .
&quot; many stars in this con@@ stell@@ ations made up approximately 125 million years ago , reaching the adult . &quot;
you are now turning at the fast@@ est .
&quot; at peak rates end these so@@ ckets , large quantities of con@@ sol@@ des . &quot;
&quot; since these win@@ ch travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a brake effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star , its rot@@ ational rate starts to slow@@ down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rot@@ ating rate of each star by which he recognis@@ es the time between the show of recogni@@ z@@ able star@@ ch -- like sun@@ spots -- realize .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ating rates points out that massive stars leng@@ th@@ less than a less massive stars .
rebel@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with danc@@ ers , with the larger stars s@@ lower pi@@ ps turn into being smaller . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; &quot; Ball@@ et &quot; &quot; the P@@ lei@@ ades &quot; we see that slow Rot@@ ors to be ten@@ ds to be mass@@ aged , spe@@ edy rot@@ ors to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ el . &quot;
&quot; as the ast@@ ral of the P@@ lei@@ ades as close is , it serves as an ide@@ alistic laboratory to compare qualities as rot@@ ating rates . &quot;
&quot; the star@@ ring of the P@@ lei@@ ades provides an an@@ chor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older . &quot; said Reb@@ zero . &quot;
&quot; there is still a lot of what we like to learn more about how the How , When and why stars their rot@@ ating rates dec@@ lined and so@@ ff@@ ing their &quot; dance &quot; . &quot; &quot;
rebel@@ ull and her colleagues have reports in three times reporting in detail about their latest analysis of the rotor rates of the rotor rates that will soon appear in the Astr@@ onom@@ ical Journal .

&quot; after his emotional return announcement will be the 41 year old professional on August 12 , against the Tamp@@ a Bay R@@ ays a last time to carry the Tri@@ k@@ ot of his New York Y@@ ank@@ ees . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; good@@ bye &apos; to the &quot; &quot; explained the 14 @-@ mal@@ icious All @-@ Star @-@ Game @-@ participant of Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez was elected as the most valuable player in the League , 2009 he won the Y@@ ank@@ ees the World Series . &quot;
his signature under a t@@ enth year deal with him since 2007 annually 27 million US dollars .
&quot; by the end of the contr@@ actor on 31 December 2017 , he will serve as consultants and youth coach - at full extent . &quot;
as a player paid it Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez long time with power .
&quot; with 696 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 Hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 until 2004 ) and since 2005 he finished some mil@@ estones . &quot;
with the Hall of F@@ ame @-@ F@@ ame @-@ F@@ ame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie M@@ ays only show two more bas@@ eball player in the most important statistics of similar values .
but in the glory of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is likely to be recorded .
&quot; for such successfully Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez - nickname &quot; &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; &quot; - on the field was , so contro@@ versi@@ al is its appearance outside the square . &quot;
&quot; already in 2009 the super@@ star was launched at &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 &quot; &quot; Ster@@ o@@ ids &quot; . &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 he was block@@ ed due to a reduction in the so @-@ called bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal until the end of 2014 for 211 games .
Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez is considered leading to have a prime minister over an anti @-@ aging clinic in South @-@ Florida .
after a legal dispute the lock was reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; the League could even have done a favor for the year 2014 , because I played a twenty years without a break , &quot; said Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez at that time . &quot;
also his desc@@ endant for days did not go .
&quot; while many Bas@@ eball leg@@ ends in their last games still receive the big stage , Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez had to sit on the bank . &quot;
&quot; my job includes no Ab@@ sho@@ ds tour . &quot;

Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 will be over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official Dop@@ pler .
a bl@@ ag@@ ious bro@@ tin would have won almost a med@@ al .
in front of the seventh competition the first official d@@ ver@@ ts have become known the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .

at Ch@@ en last Sunday the Di@@ ure@@ tics hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ d has been proven that is used as a mas@@ cot means for d@@ ver@@ aging .
the International Sport@@ sman CAS confirmed in the Fri@@ day@@ afternoon period in its exclusion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year old square had been rank@@ ed the fourth place in the fin@@ als over 100 m butterfly , just around 0.@@ 09 seconds the Bronze med@@ al . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en has had to participate in the pre@@ ch@@ ings over 50 m of the style . &quot;
&quot; at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) , the opening of the B sample and a hearing was requested . &quot;
&quot; the national association take the matter very seriously and demands from Ch@@ en full cooperation with the investigations , &quot; based X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport@@ court CAS and will accept the judgment . &quot;
&quot; the first time in history is no longer responsible for the IO@@ C , but the CAS for the sanctions of ath@@ letes with positive cases . &quot;
also in the night of Rio oo@@ zes the message on the positive test at Dan@@ ek@@ owa through which 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offen@@ sive .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my four@@ teen test was positive , &quot; this is &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV stations . &quot;
&quot; they be inno@@ cent , &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; explained the lightweight . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it is supposed to act for the blood @-@ bot@@ her@@ ent EP@@ O . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ owa became a provis@@ ional susp@@ ended , according to BN@@ T also the B @-@ sample has already been positive . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ w mel@@ ted immediately with cri@@ tique of the discovery to say .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the ath@@ letes don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians standing under observation , so many have already been ruled out . &quot;

programmer from Er@@ press@@ ungs m@@ alware is currently targeted companies - and they are successful .
&quot; according to a recent survey of m@@ alware , Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany were 40 percent of the frag@@ mentary companies in the past twelve months at least once , partly several victims of a attack with Er@@ pres@@ ser software . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies have already been the target of a bu@@ ans@@ om@@ ware ext@@ or@@ tion . &quot;
40 percent of the victims are prepared will@@ ingly prepared by the perpet@@ rators of the perpet@@ rators to be able to use the challeng@@ ed systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators are drawing up their Er@@ pres@@ ser software according to the observ@@ ations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes to attacks in corporate networks .
&quot; they are successfully used there , the potential sol@@ dering solution is considerably higher than for private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a fri@@ ght@@ ening rapid evolution of poll@@ ut@@ ants , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ Chef Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ecz@@ yn@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of the Mal@@ te programs were still designed to send advertising to advertising . &quot;
then discovered the perpet@@ rators of detection @-@ software for itself .
&quot; only , individuals were the target , but the change to company att@@ acking took place in the past few months . &quot;
&quot; R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on the computer &apos;s computer , she is looking for un@@ long changed files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files , as well as in the archives of images and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ ted the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware and delet@@ es the origin@@ als sustained .
&quot; afterwards , the software presents the demands of the pres@@ pres@@ ser . &quot;
&quot; to get the final enco@@ ding code to the files , the victims need to take money - usually in the form of Cr@@ yp@@ tow@@ el bit@@ coin - wise . &quot;
&quot; but where the personal photo database is on the game , it is associated with companies around sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production . &quot;
&quot; accordingly higher the damage fails , when a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware fails . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of the affected German companies represented by R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware , 13 per cent even had to fully inter@@ rupt the business operation , in case of case people were living in life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , several times were victims of attacks , whose patients can be threatened by the loss of hospitals . &quot;
&quot; we say the sacrifice always : pays not , you only promotes the problem &quot; &quot; explains Kl@@ ecz@@ yn@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; however 80 to 90 percent of firms that pay , their data will be back . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpet@@ rators in operation . &quot;
the h@@ acker will know this and try to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the safety resear@@ cher of F @-@ Secure the user interfaces and contact with the surveys and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money . &quot;
&quot; you declare their sacrific@@ es by chat , as they can pay by bit@@ coin , freely accessible support sites or de@@ cryp@@ t . &quot;
&quot; and , individuals are rede@@ emed by a few hundred million euros , businesses have to pay partly hard @-@ act and fifty @-@ dig@@ it tot@@ als to return their data to un@@ encryp@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; given the pot@@ entially high and relatively ris@@ ic@@ onic profits from the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware ext@@ or@@ tion , the hack@@ ers will always be professional and share the work , explains security expert Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from Anti@@ virus @-@ provider Sophos : &quot; a single person can write a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware within a week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is possible that it is three or four persons . &quot;
the programmers sell their poll@@ ut@@ ants then in the form of a software building to the actual up@@ pres@@ ser .
&quot; the existing m@@ alware kits were created by the m@@ alware themselves , advice and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; included in delivery is a adap@@ table tool , so that smaller configurations can be altered , appearance and bran@@ ding , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the ext@@ ents are then looking for further h@@ acker to spread the fresh software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; thus , one log@@ s log@@ s in one of the forums during the background , the set of a crime and is charged another way to install the software on as many PCs . &quot;
the payment is made per in@@ infected calcul@@ ator .
&quot; usually the crime then sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the risk of R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware is now known as many companies that can better secure their data .
over 50 percent of companies in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey trust in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey with file @-@ back @-@ ups and Sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
accordingly the perpet@@ rators are already pursu@@ ing new strategies .
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful awakening , the perpet@@ rators instead associated with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ Chef Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ecz@@ yn@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; thus , the damage potential depends on the type of data in order to be a lot higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in future , the perpet@@ rators may continue to take completely new goals in the internet of things . &quot;
&quot; at the Hack@@ er@@ Conference Def@@ con demonstrates safety resear@@ cher , as they could get a thermo@@ stat with their control over the Internet . &quot;
in the middle of winter the activation of a kind of mature heating could be well worth a solv@@ ent .
&quot; when the offen@@ ders then instead of heating in the future has block@@ ed a whole finished road in a factory , R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware could also be a subject in industry 4.0 . &quot;

Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and possible du@@ sting
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little S@@ UV , a little coup@@ é and also the versati@@ lity of a mini@@ v@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; it sounds pretty crowded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform like the new jazz , proves to be very flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1,@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the F@@ ond . &quot;
the materials of the interior are well finished and act pleasant , only the cock@@ pit @-@ side falls down there . &quot;
versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V when storage .
&quot; it is not only a trunk area of 453 l at high @-@ priced and 10@@ 26 l for the cl@@ oned back back , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical , when it sounds : the seat surfaces of the back bank can be shaped like cin@@ em@@ bo@@ iler and thus offer storage space , which is high up to the ceil@@ ings 1,@@ 24 m high . &quot;
&quot; the boot space can be well rewar@@ ded , however , is the cargo level with 650 mm somewhat higher than at the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the rated 1,6 @-@ l @-@ diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide range of speeds .
&quot; however , his work is likely to establish a little noise . &quot;
pleas@@ ing is the day @-@ consumption of 4,@@ 7 l / 100 km .
there is another motor@@ isation : a 1,5 @-@ l @-@ gas@@ oline with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a single @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
driving is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
the ste@@ ering is likely to be a little direct .
the equipment can be found in the top @-@ variant &quot; Executive &quot; No wishes open .
&quot; among the security systems , the City @-@ Not@@ bre@@ ms@@ assist@@ ent ( works up to Tempo 32 ) , the coll@@ ector system and the trace assist@@ ent . &quot;

&quot; but the full connectivity are available only for the top @-@ equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App @-@ Integration and more . &quot;
two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI socket are under the armrest and are therefore a bit aw@@ k@@ ward to achieve .
the approximately 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top @-@ diesel are fine .
&quot; who wants not to invest so much , receives the gas@@ oline from 20000 Euro , the diesel ab 23@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the engines meet the Euro @-@ 6 @-@ emissions standard .
with the HR @-@ V Honda offers a versatile and everyday @-@ day car .
Airline is not liable : assault on Flu@@ gg@@ ast@@ bridge
an Airline is not liable for the over@@ throw of a passenger on the river Bridge .
&quot; for a liability is concei@@ vable only with haz@@ ards that are typical for air traffic , ar@@ gu@@ ed the Upper Regional Court of Düsseldorf ( az . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) . &quot;
the bat had broken down at the over@@ throw a knee b@@ ool .
&quot; however , the accident could have been happening everywhere - it was a general risk of life , so the Court . &quot;
the airline had to pay no damage .
health insurance : when paid by the organis@@ er
&quot; after their journey only money will be back , if the cause of the disease is des@@ perate free in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; but this is only the case , if more than ten percent of the guests make the same symptoms show . &quot;
&quot; in the negoti@@ ated case , a family on the second day of their tur@@ qu@@ int@@ ures were hard to break@@ down and break down . &quot;
she spent almost the entire vacation in the room .
&quot; your disease led the holiday makers on a def@@ ective plumbing , which suppos@@ edly poll@@ uted the sea@@ water . &quot;
&quot; the family was the view , the journey would have been in@@ concei@@ ved and def@@ ended against the organiz@@ er . &quot;
in court the h@@ unters had no success .
&quot; although , the plumbing was in fact def@@ ect . &quot;
but the organiz@@ er took only shortly before departure of the h@@ unters .
he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; he did not viol@@ ate his information , so the judgment . &quot;
especially in the samples of water no im@@ puri@@ ties were found .
the disease of several hotel guests - bl@@ ur@@ ably by connecting with each other - belong@@ ed to the general li@@ fel@@ ine risk .
from 6@@ 91 guests there were only 38 seats .
&quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , according to the perpet@@ rators of refugees in Würzburg and An@@ sbach in July have had many people concerned before further attacks . &quot;
the state rose and decided to react at the same time to a terror@@ ist attack .
surely : our country becomes the force of the perpet@@ rators not with hat@@ red and disp@@ osition .
this tri@@ umph we will not give the terrorists .
&quot; if gu@@ ardi@@ ans have to leave the country , but increased safety and thickness also the consent of the population for the re@@ fuge@@ e policy . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to achieve the implementation of proposals up to the bund@@ le choice of 2017 .
&quot; he also announced another human rein@@ forcement of the security forces , namely &quot; in medium @-@ dig@@ it scale over several years . &quot;
sympath@@ ies for Terror will be back again under pun@@ ishment .
&quot; video surveillance should be improved , it is intended to make it easier to make it easier for the purchase of weapons in the Internet . &quot;

better traffic flow on the motorway exit
it is a regular basis on the street street - here a picture of November .
but this should change : the legal framework is to be extended .
&quot; this is good news for all the car &apos;s drivers , which stand in the field of vocational training every evening in St@@ au , when they drive over the motorway from Z@@ ub@@ r@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; the road construction is extended by the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the hammer street and the departure Wes@@ eler Road , the right @-@ edge road to 700 meters . &quot;
drivers can then be directly from the hammer street to the right .
&quot; the great advantage : the traffic shares at breakfast , thus increasing the total process of the current section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 . &quot;
the idea with the pro@@ long@@ ed exit had the CD@@ U &amp; D Group in the District seed of Münster @-@ West .
the driving on the Z@@ ub@@ r@@ inger nervous the drivers especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
week@@ days dates back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her way and sometimes also beyond .
reason is the needle @-@ hr on the B 51 just before the departure Wes@@ eler Road .
&quot; from here , the traffic will only be delivered to the motorway via the motorway . &quot;
the second sp@@ ur had to be returned to a well @-@ three years ago .
the reason : static calculations had the result that the bridge has no longer the required load to take in particular the sever@@ ity of heavy loads .
&quot; as long as such a @-@ pass and the associated blu@@ epr@@ int , the constant state cannot be said . &quot;
&quot; however , with years to count : for the bridge has an official rest@@ ing duration up to the year 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the legal scope of the legal framework , the provin@@ cial service has been aware of the most vulnerable time in the school holidays , because with disabilities be reck@@ oned . &quot;
the traffic will take place on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site .

rain instead of Stern@@ t@@ olls : hope of weather better
the weather has made the con@@ dom@@ en Gu@@ ck@@ ers in the south @-@ west of Germany in the night to Friday a stand by the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night may have been suitable for clouds and rain was bad for this , said the President of the observ@@ atory Wh@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Fri@@ day@@ morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather should be good , then we definitely see many star@@ s@@ akes in the sky . &quot;
&quot; with the d@@ olls , it is per@@ tain@@ ing that belong to the fast@@ est star@@ s@@ nails every hour . &quot;
&quot; they have their name , because they seem to come out of the con@@ stell@@ ation of Per@@ se@@ us that goes in the north @-@ east . &quot;
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
&quot; in the evening one was forever , in the evening one is going to sleep forever , in the morning it is far from sleep sound@@ ing no longer in sleep . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , one has problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep , and more than ten per cent of sleep can often find their sleep frequently or permanently as not rest@@ ful . &quot;
how do sleep problems or sleep ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleeping disorders , and there can be many causes underlying causes , st@@ resses Hans @-@ Gün@@ ter We@@ ees , the committee member of the German Society of Nursing and Nursing . &quot;
&quot; what one understands that , but the In@@ som@@ never , so is an entry and flow@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; exactly that can sleep up to many people as un@@ satisfac@@ tory or in@@ sufficient , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , board member in the German domestic association with practice in the Dutch Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleeping disorders are complex .
&quot; behind it , organic , psych@@ ic or troub@@ led factors , but also medicines . &quot;
not rarely is the sleep expression of another disorder .
&quot; very early A@@ w@@ aking up is mostly with depression frequent , &quot; says We@@ joined . &quot;
and it can be that different factors are each other .
&quot; who has a band@@ width , can be bad , aw@@ ake all two to three hours and begins bl@@ ur@@ ably to greet all of all @-@ day problems and care , gives you an example . &quot;
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
from when one should be with sleeping disorders to a doctor ?
&quot; who was not well established over a period of a month at least three nights per week , and it is imp@@ aired on the day , should go to the medical doctor . &quot;
&quot; imp@@ air@@ ment can be quite different : one is down@@ cast , tired , in@@ sign@@ age , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily ir@@ rit@@ able , has vo@@ icing or physical dis@@ comfort such as stomach or head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; to lin@@ ter@@ ing the sleep , it is important to find their causes . &quot;
&quot; as a treatment options , among other things are behavi@@ our@@ al changes , a cogni@@ tive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or medicines - classic bed@@ t@@ ations only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ question . &quot;
&quot; Nieder@@ gel@@ ass@@ ene dor@@ ms , there is hardly to be st@@ resses Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze , head of inter@@ disciplinary surgery at the Char@@ it@@ é University Medicine Berlin . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one should in case of sleep problems at first turn left to the atri@@ cian , def@@ ended We@@ ar . &quot;
he can clari@@ fy whether the problems have a physical cause .
&quot; who should be in the sleep , and what happens there ? &quot;
&quot; to study in the sleep laboratory advise medicine , for example when snor@@ ing with breathing difficulties , with a disease or if you do not find the cause of a break@@ age . &quot;
&quot; actually , it does not have to prepare for the examination . &quot;
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; only please do not make lun@@ ar @-@ sheep , &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
after the cab@@ ling you go to his normal time into the bed .
&quot; in addition to the electro@@ des on the body one is carrying a Nas@@ en@@ br@@ ille , a chest strap , and a coll@@ ector of the finger . &quot;
&quot; moreover , a camera on the ceiling shows the sleeping . &quot;
how can we suffer@@ ers the problems in the handle ?
there are quite a lot of pay@@ ers where you can get for better sleep .
&quot; We@@ Be counts on : regular bed@@ time and up@@ loading times , not too long in bed , on the day not sleep , not to sleep , alcohol and not at the clock - then you can immediately reck@@ on , and that is quite and not conduc@@ ive . &quot;
what the jungle camp with missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has expressed himself on Facebook to dis@@ appoint@@ ing the D@@ SV team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 he was fet@@ ched at the short @-@ world championship in Doh@@ a for the first time and presented at the same time at the same time at the same time .
now the former D@@ SV Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler via Facebook sent against his in the critic@@ ised ex @-@ team members .
&quot; in a country where a Olympi@@ asi@@ eger 20,000 € Pre@@ mie gets and a jungle red , 15@@ 0.000 € should be wonder@@ ed over lack of med@@ als . &quot; &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old in the night to Friday on his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the conveyor system in swimming @-@ sport is bad , the d@@ ood@@ le controlled , on the other hand very good . &quot;
&quot; thus , we cannot compete with countries that do not promote a lot and do not do it in the topic of d@@ oping , or even operate it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t say that here the controls should be adjusted , he explained . &quot;
&quot; he wanted to start a com@@ eb@@ ack , I would have to be reported D@@ ei@@ bler already nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( N@@ ada ) . &quot;
it is exactly how to keep it with countries .

airport : Ban@@ de of baggage handling
professional Di@@ ebe at the Airport Düsseldorf
&quot; civilians by the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police , on Thursday the removal of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years . &quot;
the Tat@@ ar had seen as a ban@@ de several k@@ illing and baggage allowance .
&quot; against 21.@@ 30 clock pro@@ claimed officials in the area of the airport Düsseldorf a ban@@ de again , which was known to the police officers from past theft . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had been committed to several delicacies since the middle of July , and were extremely professional , and particularly professional . &quot;
&quot; the specialists of the crime com@@ press@@ ors 34 can be the po@@ etry , the peculi@@ ar for the coming of criminal off@@ ences according to Germany , four de@@ eds . &quot;
&quot; thereby , they had a total of more than 15.@@ 000 euros . &quot;
&quot; built @-@ in @-@ building blocks , a few Lind@@ enb@@ ut@@ ches : the Riga road in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain works on the first sight not so , but the police counts them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; one goes along the road from east to west , one gets to play@@ grounds , a fres@@ co nur@@ sery and a bi@@ ol@@ aden . &quot;
to the fa@@ ç@@ ade of a gray house does someone hit &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot;
&quot; compared to a Li@@ dl , which is also soon to be dem@@ ol@@ ished , is already built : until 2017 , there is a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments . &quot;
&quot; articles about this &quot; &quot; tr@@ endy district &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain is referred to in the last weeks , however , in the last few weeks we are preferred with burning cars . &quot;
&quot; reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile have the inhabitants of le@@ ase , on the ground floor are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , I had repeatedly called for a hard approach to the police against the project as &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonom@@ ous violence . &quot;
&quot; after June 22nd , the rooms were vac@@ ated on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ smi@@ de , with 300 police officers , with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site , off parts of the street and gave visitors from it to enter the house with the number 94 . &quot;
meanwhile the renovated construction workers on behalf of the unknown land@@ owners the rooms .
&quot; on 13 July the Berlin Administ@@ r@@ ative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal , and a day later educated police and buil@@ ders under the Ju@@ bel from sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; in this summer afternoon the road peaceful , parents go with children sp@@ az@@ ing , people sit on the side@@ walk before the houses in the sun , others are talking about . &quot;
in the immediate vicinity of the main projects are a basic school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
&quot; left violence is not the main orge of many inhabitants : Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives since 1999 in the j@@ z , and Jana * that is composed here three children , above all from the police presence . &quot;
with the inhabitants of the land @-@ projects they share the care of rising ten@@ ets and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
&quot; it does not sound like a pine , which was mostly un@@ attended by an Andalu@@ sian left . &quot;
the dit@@ ch to make the Berlin inner court and the police between land@@ owners and their neighbours exists so apparently not .
&quot; Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the East Berlin@@ s was actually a traditional working @-@ quarter , which is also a lower Average . it has a lower Average and high ar@@ rest risk . &quot;
&quot; also house@@ ware , and the inf@@ ants have been occupied already for a long time in the former G@@ DR : 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former G@@ DR , including nearly the whole Main@@ land street very close to the Riga . &quot;
&quot; while the main@@ zer was filled with large police force in a regular road of police , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ aer and are still inhabited by the people who they occupied 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district in recent years has become increasingly becoming the mag@@ nets for tourists and elect@@ or@@ char@@ ds from all over the world : with them now divide into the G@@ DR @-@ Time and former land@@ owners . &quot;
&quot; this also makes it noticeable in the ten@@ ant , which has increased almost 60 percent since 2009 . &quot;
&quot; many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ aer are attacked than symbols for this development : one can recognize them in wor@@ ded discs or fresh fac@@ ades , which were covered with colour@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; no other road was mentioned so many times together with the words &quot; &quot; left @-@ autonom@@ ous violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; one reason for that not all neighbours can be seen as a problem , could not necessarily be affected by cri@@ min@@ ality as physi@@ otherapy such as physi@@ que , and almost exclusively against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; the most important part of the criminal off@@ ences make their damage , which meet new buildings and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has since 17 years in a rental house next to the contro@@ versi@@ al 94 lives , cannot be any talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; what violence does , it is sp@@ icy : the people in the 94 are their neighbours , which are certainly not intended . &quot;
also the famous burning cars also give the car directly in the rig already no longer .
&quot; for the studied architec@@ tin , her street is not a cri@@ min@@ eller burner , on the contrary : &quot; here one will help each other , lives together on the street and gets more of each other than what is different . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliber@@ ately drag@@ ged into the Riga Road and stayed here .
&quot; for that reason , it was also so important that the arri@@ ves have returned to her street : from the police , politics and the media , in July all suddenly turn the full@@ ness over the district . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to take away : through leg@@ s@@ less constructions in former buildings , which impos@@ e the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; these are ultimately con@@ dom@@ ini@@ um housing , which are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not as well as cont@@ amin@@ ated , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction can I absolutely not gu@@ ilt . &quot;
&quot; but what should you do , if one never heard someone ? &quot;
&quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides fru@@ stration , even with the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; for Zu@@ ge@@ zo@@ gens that anno@@ yed about color bom@@ bs , Kerstin has been a little understanding : the food @-@ projects and the left scene belong@@ ed to the pine . &quot;
&quot; who@@ ever goes , should be aware - just like someone who draws into a pub , there is bad about noise . &quot;
all persons asked with the names of the names are asked to be called with their correct name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is new re@@ fuge@@ e officers
Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is the contact for integration and organiz@@ er .
furthermore it is a social worker on the spot .
since July Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le the re@@ fuge@@ e officers for Ur@@ bach .
the Social Policy in support the team of management around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; it sees itself as a response to all players : refugees , labour market for refugees , administration , authorities and who else fails . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer of the labour market indicates that the volunte@@ ers are more than grateful that D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is now that D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le now is , the ei@@ er@@ leg@@ end Woll@@ mil@@ chs@@ au , which above all a problem has . &quot;
&quot; thus , some - less potential showed rather than on the variety of wish @-@ to @-@ goal @-@ target@@ ing , as the administration wanted to write the place . &quot;
&quot; we were looking for a administrative force with a talent for languages and people , connected with many years of experience in the field of social labour , just an ei@@ er@@ leg@@ end Woll@@ mil@@ chs@@ au . &quot;
&quot; yet , Administ@@ r@@ ative work is not their central area , the Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is going to organise organization working with local people on site and also behind the scenes , as well as nets . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been around for around six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent place for three years with the possibility of extension .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer , that Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le honest and full players are supported . &quot;
&quot; there are big and small problems , organizational , human and understanding . &quot;
soon new containers in the Was@@ enstraße
&quot; a serious issue has been found for some time , apartments for the junction of flights that have been acknowled@@ ged . &quot;
responsible for the supply of the municipalities are responsible .
you have to teach refugees in own or rented apartments .
&quot; the cost of the construction , the rent or the renovation of this accommodation must carry the municipalities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the provin@@ cial and Job@@ center .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment . &quot;
the search is designed for some time than very difficult .
de fac@@ to does not find private apartments .
&quot; it does not work so far , be dependent on both private apartments , so that D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , meant to be shared apartments , as it is so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; so , soon new container will be placed in the was@@ machine . &quot;
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the keyword , are the Reg@@ ine client and Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a fixed stri@@ kes , there are tra@@ inees , training courses , training courses , a @-@ euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants , which must be found or furnished . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help household , do non @-@ profit work - and this motiv@@ ates and very tidy , as Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
they hopes that the work will lead to a positive external effect .
&quot; this is &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity is not only work .
&quot; the day does a fixed structure , say D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop an enc@@ eless feeling .
&quot; so it &apos;s offers such as sport , contacts with local and above all language courses . &quot;
professional courses are key@@ ed .
so also here administration and volunte@@ ers .
&quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling , they are welcome in Germany and welcome . &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; you have to explain the refugees that it just takes , and they can make the time sensible , for example , with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who will eventually make the feeling that he could anyone can &apos;t work in Ur@@ bach anyone , thir@@ st do not work and be un@@ mist@@ aken , who will never integrate himself . &quot;
the distinct majority may be motivated .
&quot; but there is also , the customer says honest , &quot; people , in which nothing goes . &quot; the work of D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
all this is already a &quot; mot@@ h task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : did the two after the recent occurr@@ ences are afraid of radic@@ alisation , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine client clearly stated , &quot; what man@@ cher could call &quot; &quot; a Rest@@ ric@@ iko and wants to exclu@@ de it but not . &quot;
sensi@@ tiv@@ ates are the hel@@ pers but already .
these inci@@ dents were also subject to refugees too .
&quot; they would have the fear that the attacks did not bring them into call . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do , &quot; says Reg@@ ine client . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; so , principal and volunte@@ ers must keep on the spot and in the region of activities . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , they are always in the background that soon a new Sto@@ cks of refugees could come to refugees and migrants to Ur@@ bach . &quot;
needs Germany a bound@@ ary ?
this question is clear to answer the policy .
&quot; actually , it is un@@ fair to place it hel@@ pers on the spot . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we are not yet arrived , where we say , &quot; says Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
no new refugees that would be able to relax .
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher are already outs@@ et at outs@@ et , the previous people are reasonable . &quot;
&quot; these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men . &quot;
&quot; but if people are in need , they can help them are both women . &quot;
&quot; the political world position is so complex , there is no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : sought @-@ book with heli@@ copter
the police pads fle@@ w about one hour long different areas - un@@ successful .
two unknown men are inv@@ oked at the Fri@@ day@@ morning at 8.@@ 50 p.m. to an apartment in an apartment house in Lind@@ en@@ weg .
the inhabitants surprised the two and proposed the Un@@ hol@@ de to escape .
&quot; the two men were about 1,@@ 65 to 1,@@ 70 meters big , well mas@@ ked , tru@@ ders both Blue@@ je@@ ans and black h@@ oody pul@@ lis . &quot;
you are moving towards the city center .
for F@@ ahn@@ der@@ ation the police took several tri@@ pl@@ ings as well as a pol@@ ishing tro@@ ug@@ ber .
the F@@ ahn@@ der@@ lands went without success .
&quot; eventually , the unknown before the apartment or near the flight . &quot;
