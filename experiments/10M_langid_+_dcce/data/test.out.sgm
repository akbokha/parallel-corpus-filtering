<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and the trade agreement TTP - they want to be both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"but unone are the two US presidential elections, but with the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic question."</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical difference. "</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the state on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warned before how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to donate the economy to death and regulate death.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in contrast, it would be quite different, claimed Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will continue to regulates Regulatory and he makes for a far-reaching control reform with lower wheelers, strong - for individuals and for companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton is said: the state has certain tasks to fulfil, he has disadvantaged opportunities and needs money."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, taxes would raise taxes for the rich, says it."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in the nuts, Trump and Clinton is almost protected."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidates even premiered the greatest investment in new jobs since World War II.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policy and are rejected by the state-transcript of the republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">"so on Trump, so we could get to their internal discussion."</seg>
<seg id="17">More clearly are the differences in energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build colepower plants and drive the cohesion of coal in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="19">"oil-promotion should also be possible in so far protected areas, the Paris climate agreement wants to announce it."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in contrast, Clinton wants to expand their investment program with its investment programme:" "a country will create the superpower energies and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it."</seg>
<seg id="22">"however, not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpazigel trade agreements, they want to do not to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both they want to isolate the USA from international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">The should then be paid even better, calls for about Clinton. "</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7,25 US dollars is a hunger strike.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it at 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump is to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must, then he says, he might not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months is likely to develop more likely to develop the tax policy of both camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one side, Trump is on the one side, who wants to stimulate the economy and citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics keep him ahead, so that the buddeficit would only be even bigger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton wants to ask at least by the rich wants to pay more taxes, and their critics are saying, more taxes are not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are refugees.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Münchner North in one of the few decentralized accommodations for all mature women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January Condrobs stayed together with Pro Familia and the Münchner Frauenhilfe.</seg>

<seg id="27">On the run it goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"that tugboats for example for a bottle of water is calling for a sexual act, is not rarity," says Bahr. "</seg>

<seg id="30">"who believe that the end as soon as they anchors in Germany, irre, tells us."</seg>
<seg id="31">"also here, the women in refugee accommodation would often be considered as minderoted and worst if abused."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this results that about 90 per cent of women who are staying in the north of the Münchner North, they are estimated."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not voluntary."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women were so usual that they don't say anything.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't trust, openly talking about the experience, because the shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">"since they often did not help to help, find it more accommodations only for them, asking Bahr."</seg>

<seg id="41">In Oberbayern - Under- and Mittelfranken are available in some common undertakings or own houses only for all the women and their children.</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">Also the committee "rights of women and gender equality" in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study that was published for the committee, it says:" it is very important that men and women are separated. "</seg>

<seg id="47">"how much the women feel of this protective needs, one can take advantage of the cracy that is available on the house in Munich."</seg>

<seg id="27">"Erdogan needs first and foremost all friends who he can get, after spending the last month at a weakened state of almost his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="28">Repetitive terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken them.</seg>

<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey - especially the ban on charter flights that each year usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast.</seg>

<seg id="38">"to this end, the continued Groll on the Schneckentempo of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pivotal to move out of the cool mood and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"the Russian state ef won in Ankara with security a bonus, that he sought after the sought-up support for the chosen state organs."</seg>
<seg id="40">This is well as well as a matter of course in Moscow it has a profound fear of regimuth.</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit meeting in this charming palace at the sea made it both Russia and Turkey, one as it was once described as a analyst" "alliance of outsider", "the alliance of outsider" "to be treated and badly treated and now."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two still big differences."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the greatest difference is Syria, where Moscow had recently announced the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey could support Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be significant, that after almost three hours of the first meeting they said both President on the press conference that they could not have been striped."</seg>

<seg id="8">Last week threaten thousands of people on the streets and slowed fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The response of the government was unbarred according to human rights organizations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses took on that policemen at zig unarmed protesters were poured and kill.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the run-sensitive videos about the protests, probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how safety men will show young people with staves, while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The Chief of the UN Authority for Human Rights is now calling for an incoming investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to stick to this country and even more difficult, it said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group."</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is estimated to Nigeria the most complete land of Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopia, to fight terrorism across the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia Economy is expanding at the respectable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">His infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new player in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are usually quiet and clean and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">"even though Ethiopia, everything else as a role model for democracy - human rights organizations have continually led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country became restricted, with presidents effectively have been effective for silence."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent to exile or into prison, killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But this could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppose people and these no other options have except to protest, breaks it off," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopian. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protest.</seg>

<seg id="27">"at the same time, the tensions along the border to Eritrea; a battle for this zacky, controversial line called for in June hundreds of lives."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analyst advocate that separatists such as the Oromo-liberalisation Front or the National liberation of Ogaden, who were more or less forced to protect the turbulence over the past few years."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of before himself halted in the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only during the last few years, many Ethiopia has been able to communicate with the social media, as cheap smartphones were more common and improved the Internet services improved."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government uses the access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, does many people still communicate over internet-proxies, which hide it where they stopped."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopia said that they gathered themselves to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity among the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethics in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"for eons of prosperous the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia, in politics and economy, while keeping the Oromos, some of which are many Muslims and living in flat areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But even this is changing just.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here, under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests found in areas of Amhara and Narmos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have dominates that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which dominates around 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, in the secret services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr Meles, a former rebellion, was up to his death in a non-publious disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was regarded as tactical genius, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was especially addressed to use early signs of dissatisfaction and special officers to edit opponents and make them unharmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime is lacking in this fundamental creature," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopian new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen from relatively unded reasons to take the position of Mr Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike the Lord Meles, who came from the Tigray Region North of Slovenia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he did not enjoy the confidence of the tigray controlled security services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the outcome will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time that Ethiopia had such a rebellion was in 2005, after thousands of elections protested that according to the information of analyzers seemingly dominated by the government and subsequently stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"while the subsequent raid were killed many protesters, even if there were fewer than in the past months, and this time of unrest became relatively fast over the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="52">"the Ethiopian leaders of the Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructural planning, as well as the new pendlerfication, as well as for their measurable advances in poverty-fighting drugs."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this does not prevent the intensification of the internal failure of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous form of ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month of grips aboomination in Gondar, a amharian city, by Tigray guided shops and the hatred opposite the Tigray is always busy in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that protests and other Western allies put into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenders about the neighboring Somalia, even if they had recently reeiled that it has closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West also wants to support democracy, he will not want to merge his allies in a already volatilen area."</seg>

<seg id="20">"Julius Nielsen and his colleagues were examined 28 Greenland, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Svalbard as a whaling from the depth of Nordatlantiks."</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest spai was just 81 cm long while the largest 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="22">"to identify the age of animals, analyzed them with the carbon-14-method of the lineup of the hair."</seg>

<seg id="29">"that Greenland-female-females only get offspring if they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">"now, the researchers of the length could arrange a age."</seg>

<seg id="34">"also the previous record holder, a 211 years old Gröngue, in whose bacon at the Neck a 120 years old Harpoise tip, was caught in front of Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures often the organism of the living animals live on austerity.</seg>
<seg id="36">It thus mature later - and operators slow.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm up in cold water, the animals are often very large."</seg>

<seg id="7">"Regine customer of the labour market indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now that Deuschle now is, the eierlegend Wollmilchsau, which above all a problem has."</seg>
<seg id="8">"thus, some - less potential showed rather than on the variety of wish-to-goal-targeting, as the administration wanted to write the place."</seg>
<seg id="9">"we were looking for a administrative force with a talent for languages and people, connected with many years of experience in the field of social labour, just an eierlegend Wollmilchsau."</seg>
<seg id="10">"yet, Administrative work is not their central area, the Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="11">"above all, it is going to organise organization working with local people on site and also behind the scenes, as well as nets."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been around for around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50-percent place for three years with the possibility of extension.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine customer, that Annika Deuschle honest and full players are supported. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding."</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">"a serious issue has been found for some time, apartments for the junction of flights that have been acknowledged."</seg>
<seg id="18">Responsible for the supply of the municipalities are responsible.</seg>
<seg id="19">You have to teach refugees in own or rented apartments.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the cost of the construction, the rent or the renovation of this accommodation must carry the municipalities themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the provincial and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">"problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment."</seg>
<seg id="23">The search is designed for some time than very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">"it does not work so far, be dependent on both private apartments, so that Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, meant to be shared apartments, as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so, soon new container will be placed in the wasmachine."</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, are the Regine client and Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a fixed strikes, there are trainees, training courses, training courses, a-euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants, which must be found or furnished."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine customer. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building yard or help household, do non-profit work - and this motivates and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports."</seg>
<seg id="33">They hopes that the work will lead to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this is" "no employment therapy." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity is not only work.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day does a fixed structure, say Deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop an enceless feeling.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so it's offers such as sport, contacts with local and above all language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are keyed.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also here administration and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="41">"it is central that the refugees get the feeling, they are welcome in Germany and welcome."</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"you have to explain the refugees that it just takes, and they can make the time sensible, for example, with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"who will eventually make the feeling that he could anyone can't work in Urbach anyone, thirst do not work and be unmistaken, who will never integrate himself."</seg>
<seg id="45">The distinct majority may be motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"but there is also, the customer says honest," people, in which nothing goes. "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "moth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: did the two after the recent occurrences are afraid of radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," "says Regine client clearly stated," what mancher could call "" a Restriciko and wants to exclude it but not. "</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensitivates are the helpers but already.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents were also subject to refugees too.</seg>
<seg id="52">"they would have the fear that the attacks did not bring them into call." ""</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do," says Regine client. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"so, principal and volunteers must keep on the spot and in the region of activities."</seg>
<seg id="56">"in doing so, they are always in the background that soon a new Stocks of refugees could come to refugees and migrants to Urbach."</seg>
<seg id="57">Needs Germany a boundary?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question is clear to answer the policy.</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to place it helpers on the spot."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we are not yet arrived, where we say," says Annika Deuschle. "</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees that would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">"Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher are already outset at outset, the previous people are reasonable."</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are currently around 100 people, mainly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but if people are in need, they can help them are both women."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world position is so complex, there is no simple answers."</seg>
