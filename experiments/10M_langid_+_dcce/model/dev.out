&quot; but at the meeting , it is supposed to go to the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ state solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been stra@@ ined for years .
Washington critic@@ ised the permanent settlement of Israel and raises Net@@ any@@ ahu weak will in the peace process .
&quot; by the deal of Obama , the deal of nuclear programme has deteri@@ or@@ ated the relationship between the two further deteri@@ or@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had talked to the invitation of the Repub@@ li@@ ans before the U.S. Congress held a contro@@ versi@@ al speech , which was partly a domin@@ ating against Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken by Obama , a meeting was rejected this with reference to the upcoming election in Israel . &quot;
&quot; in a call , Professor , his girlfriend goes shot up . &quot;
&quot; in a call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on she told the police of the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officers had to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; it was important to emph@@ asi@@ ze that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; but still live and probably excited , and he said , the family relationship of dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house , the officials spoke of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand @-@ driven note that I wanted to go to a white block , I loved it , I loved it . this was the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that he has travel@@ ed in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ veland , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , rot@@ ated , already 300 miles on the school grounds , where he was shot up by the police a popular historical background , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office and killed . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ erst@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff members have heard at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that he made the f@@ ear@@ thy not@@ ation day after that .
&quot; until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb did the life , when the police took him bo@@ iler . &quot;
&quot; a day after shooting in the university , the students and lec@@ tur@@ ers to hide themselves behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get an image of what he &apos;s motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the issu@@ er of both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped him to draw an image of an talented , but possibly difficult teachers to draw . &quot;
students say that they are joy@@ ful in their classes .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where pr@@ enti@@ ss died , he did not have a history of violence or a criminal ancest@@ or . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt itself had been mentioned in one of his written book in which he did the &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; , &quot; with which he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both taught in the Department of Economics and History , whose teaching body 17 members includes , and many students visited courses of both . &quot;
at the same time there were some dis@@ likes to have problem@@ atic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; a student , bran@@ don @-@ avers , the Lamb , said , he also seemed a bit excited and nervous as if something wrong with him is wrong . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that Lamb he tells him that he had done at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 with stress . &quot;
he previously asked the Delta State University around an am@@ oring for health reasons and said that he had some health problem .
in this year he only taught two online courses .
&quot; recent changes in the employment policy of the University which meant that the promotion , meant for the Lamb so hard he had no guarantee for an automatic way to establish a Assistant of Assistant . &quot;
&quot; University President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said , he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs thought . &quot;
&quot; these are questions , the Lamb is no longer possible . &quot;
after the flight out of the campus the police found after Lam@@ bs Sp@@ ur as he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ark@@ ans@@ as .
&quot; before he could be arrested , kill @-@ with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still going on in the driv@@ eway .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why lam@@ b went to this house , but Johnson said that he believes that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
Lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; he began his work at the University , which has 3.@@ 500 students in a town with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and ped@@ ago@@ gic . &quot;
he gradu@@ ated in the spring in a ped@@ ago@@ gic .
&quot; one of the many years of many friends in Lam@@ bs burned him as intelligent , char@@ is@@ matic and funny . &quot;
Carla H@@ air@@ ston said it was 15 and Lamb was 20 , when they met through mutual friends . &quot;
&quot; they and her friends were at high school , and he was the cool older Ker@@ l , who tried several years to bring her guitar playing . &quot;
he was at that time the women &apos;s warm .
&quot; all the girls left there when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson Metro@@ polis of Bran@@ don . &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ er@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; I said my wife in the not@@ ion , &quot; &quot; I have killed my wife , but there was no judgment of a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house that ad@@ joining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband from Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said , they were founded 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old now . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed on the floor , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en over his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely the best friends .
&quot; o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he did never met them , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail , he heard that he was interested in music and blu@@ es . &quot;
Lamb met pre@@ f@@ ss , as he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail three years ago both on a summer of the year . &quot;
later they played together the one or other g@@ ig .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sing her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nur@@ se practition@@ er that worked for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a Bar@@ ke@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Jul@@ ep Room , a weak illumin@@ ated bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he &apos;s servants and Pr@@ enz@@ ss Night at night , ended in front of a Carin@@ thia audience . &quot;
there was no indication that something wrong .
&quot; simply just a couple couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were on elabor@@ ate and dres@@ ses with one another .
&quot; I mean , they both had a good sense of seriously . &quot;

UN @-@ boss says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ Moon says , his response to Russia increased military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of almost five years in the conflict , and more weapons are only wast@@ ed violence and mis@@ ery for millions of people . &quot;

&quot; he regret that the revol@@ utions in the Council and within the Syrian people and regional powers that make this situation un@@ solved . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; B@@ on invited the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity at which the crisis broke the same solidarity and unity in achieving nuclear weapons . &quot;
8 Um@@ fr@@ age@@ ability that demonstrate that Donald Tru@@ mp are serious .
some have tried to find him as a flop .
others have taken him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to drag Donald Tru@@ mp from the upper ranks in surveys , it has not yet working . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tru@@ mp in the two @-@ dig@@ it area , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate . &quot;
of course it is too early in the leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ure .
no claims that Tru@@ mp is probably winning the Repub@@ li@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphas@@ ise that at that time in 2011 , Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership was given to the rising Herman C@@ ain , of which nobody was won a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why it would have to fight in a general election .
&quot; but out@@ sider groups such as J@@ eb Bus@@ hs Super P@@ AC , and the conserv@@ ative Economic Group Club for Growth now recognize tru@@ mp@@ s stamina , and start their dollars flow to over@@ throw him . &quot;
&quot; here are some current conversion values , which suggests that the real estate @-@ Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase : &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s Popular levels have been around 180 degrees .
&quot; just before Donald Tru@@ mp was introduced to mid June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans saw the property Mo@@ gu@@ l . &quot;
until mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
&quot; now , six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a positive opinion of Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
about three of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa did last week that 60 percent of the repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two thir@@ ds of the GO@@ P @-@ voters GO@@ P would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
&quot; in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the repub@@ lic@@ ans , they were either enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if Tru@@ mp would be nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of 10 say they would be &quot; angry , &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot;
&quot; Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm like Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent ) , they would be &quot; enthusiastic &quot; v@@ s. 40 percent , which are the same about Tru@@ mp . &quot;
the next in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with just 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand 47 percent of the Repub@@ li@@ can voters , that they were &quot; un@@ happy &quot; or &quot; angry . &quot;
a majority of Repub@@ li@@ can sees Tru@@ mp@@ s temper@@ ament not as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely cri@@ tici@@ zed for its bom@@ bas@@ tic and bel@@ lied mis@@ sive statements , believe 52 percent of the repub@@ lic@@ ans are the right temper@@ ament for a president , that ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is in the first demonstration of the nation , the federal state I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for an off@@ spring , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless 44 percent , that he did not have the personality to be effective , and almost six of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament is not pas@@ se at the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Repub@@ li@@ can wh@@ ist@@ es get used to the idea .
when they put their money @-@ down , they keep the Repub@@ li@@ can wh@@ ist@@ le Tru@@ mp for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked , who is most sought after the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C from the past week four out of ten that Tru@@ mp was the best bet . &quot;
this is a change since the time when four out of ten at the end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
total disclosure : GO@@ P voters have not had the clear@@ est crystal clear in the past .
at this point in the last cycle four out of ten Repub@@ li@@ can testi@@ fy that Rick Per@@ ry would gain the nom@@ ination against only 28 % for the final candidates Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
&quot; nevertheless , it shows that a large number of GO@@ P constitu@@ ents of Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign act as pl@@ au@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; even if the repub@@ lic@@ ans assembled themselves to a different candidate , Tru@@ mp propos@@ es almost everybody . &quot;
&quot; some experts suggest that the sh@@ atter@@ ing field probably contributes to Tru@@ mp@@ s , while the anti @-@ Tru@@ mp support is distributed across more than a do@@ zen of other candidates . &quot;
&quot; but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ in @-@ head @-@ race between Tru@@ mp and most other Repub@@ li@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp are har@@ dened with majority . &quot;
&quot; he found before Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 Points lead , in front of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Wal@@ ker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally front of Paul Paul , John Cas@@ ich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ in @-@ head @-@ race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who defe@@ ats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would fetch the business with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race .
a kn@@ itting majority of Donald @-@ Tru@@ mp &apos;s fans says that they have formed their minds .
&quot; a new survey of CB@@ S / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters , the Tru@@ mp support , say they have fixed their voices . &quot;
&quot; of course , it can happen a lot to change that , and no one can truly say , never to change the opinion . &quot;
46 percent they said that they can leave the door open to other candidates .
&quot; yet Tru@@ mp@@ s is stronger competition at the moment of other out@@ sider , the neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ on Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say that they have formed their minds are twice as common for Tru@@ mp . &quot;
six out of 10 Repub@@ li@@ can say that they coinci@@ de with Tru@@ mp in the subject of immigration .
&quot; since then Donald Tru@@ mp in his election campaign was born two months of immig@@ rants from Mexico &quot; &quot; r@@ ape &quot; , was the immigration and aff@@ ecting in public dis@@ course . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ bas@@ tic re@@ prints of Tru@@ mp deci@@ du@@ ano Americans from the Repub@@ li@@ can party and the re @-@ oriented efforts shall be damaged .
&quot; but after the new ABC @-@ Mail pol@@ l from Monday , six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans can agree that they coinci@@ de with Tru@@ mp on issues of immigration . &quot;
&quot; so long , the immigration in the spot@@ light sh@@ aded , it will seem to do Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
the fru@@ stration of the government kl@@ etter@@ t on new high@@ s .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son , meanwhile , some half of the support of Repub@@ li@@ can sc@@ ans , mainly through their out@@ sider status . &quot;
&quot; six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say in the new Mont@@ ags of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with regul@@ arity . &quot;
and they are also angry .
&quot; a survey by D@@ es Mo@@ ines register / Bloom@@ berg in I@@ owa , two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa repub@@ lic@@ ans are fru@@ str@@ ated by the Repub@@ li@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; &quot; un@@ satisfied &quot; &quot; and 21 percent &quot; &quot; c@@ utter@@ ed &quot; . &quot; &quot;

Champions League : Bayern @-@ Dream@@ start thanks to Müller and Godd@@ ze
Zwei@@ rad@@ acher Tor@@ sch@@ ütze in Piraeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller eb@@ ted the FC Bayern way to go to a earned 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ak@@ os Piraeus .
a sou@@ l@@ ly pr@@ el@@ ude of the Champions @-@ League @-@ season .
the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Godd@@ ess gave the FC Bayern in the Hex@@ enk@@ ger of Piraeus a dream start into the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; .
the team of coach PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won her pr@@ el@@ ude in the Champions League at the Greek Rek@@ tor Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to the g@@ arb@@ age Twin pack ( 5@@ 2. / 90@@ th + 2 ) and id@@ ols by 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ f@@ th Star@@ ter@@ lo@@ g in series should be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola will finally pick the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich .
Müller received at his 28@@ th @-@ day in the Champions League for Bavaria &apos;s leadership of the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ ar@@ Roberto which was one as the flan@@ k to pass the world mei@@ sters .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate &quot; , &quot; had been promised in Bavaria , Philip l@@ ah@@ m before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31 688 hot@@ lover fans - and the coin considered . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea without sh@@ iny .
&quot; Piraeus had won his recent six home games in the Royal Class , including the well @-@ known clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
2011 st@@ ol@@ per@@ te here also Bor@@ ussia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; but Bavaria , was defe@@ ated in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up Du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
they went cour@@ age@@ ous to come with their disc@@ sive efforts but often to meth@@ ane works .
the attacks were too often crossed by playing dou@@ glas Dou@@ glas Costa eb@@ led to the ver@@ on@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i by the previous Bra@@ ret@@ ger Om@@ ar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more fortun@@ ate from right more fortun@@ ate than his flan@@ k from the right half @-@ field in the upper left corner of the door@@ step .
in the 67@@ th minute the World Champion has been the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half of one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first of all , as the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ St@@ ür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown the Head@@ ball of Poland struck by the line ( 26 ) . &quot;
&quot; then by mul@@ tit@@ ling , the go@@ alie Roberto with the knee par@@ ked ( 35@@ . ) . &quot;
&quot; although the Bavaria had an unusual game , we could set the con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous breed . &quot;
on a door@@ ke@@ eper Manuel Neu@@ er was Lost .
&quot; so , as he had a shot of Ide@@ ye about the Lat@@ te ste@@ ad@@ te ( 56@@ th ) . &quot;
&quot; before Neu@@ er , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola could defend a quarter with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , which made it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario Go@@ ds , according to mus@@ cular problems back in the f@@ ader , sat at first sitting outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup did not have given light after the final meeting was given , &quot; Sport@@ vor@@ stood Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to make something different from it , this is already mal@@ icious . &quot;
also at the first change Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought K@@ ings@@ ley Com@@ an for the written Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) .
&quot; id@@ ze was late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made 13 minutes later everything was clear , by iv@@ ative Müller still set a dr@@ aught . &quot;
in front of the game it was in the stadium to Kra@@ w@@ allen .
&quot; after a smaller group of partly dec@@ lined from Bavaria @-@ fans in their spect@@ ators , evi@@ den@@ ced the followers of hosts re@@ aus with words and ges@@ tures pro@@ vo@@ z@@ ated , attacked the security forces and went on with head@@ aches against the coin @-@ hang@@ ers . &quot;
at least a Bayern @-@ Fan was in@@ ju@@ red from the stadium .
&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk to lose teeth . &quot;
&quot; who smo@@ kes , this is not only the l@@ ungs , but also the teeth - that places a pot@@ s@@ dam@@ er long @-@ term study . &quot;
good news : in case the risk decre@@ ases the risk fast .
smo@@ kers have a much higher risk to lose their teeth early .
&quot; this goes out from the long @-@ term study of an international research teams , including several members of the German Institute of Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to non @-@ smoking rooms was the risk to lose their teeth pre@@ matur@@ ely to lose weight - up to 3,@@ 6 @-@ fold higher . &quot;
the scientists had been observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
main pillars for dental dec@@ ay be c@@ aries and in@@ flamm@@ ations of the ging@@ i@@ va . st@@ resses the DI@@ f@@ E .
&quot; for these par@@ od@@ on@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors . &quot;
the connection between smoking and dental loss is therefore possible to co@@ us@@ ed@@ ed dentistry in case of room .
&quot; not clari@@ fied , in@@ extent smoking also increases the risk for tooth dec@@ ay . &quot;
&quot; people who stopped using smoking , could reduce their risk but within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
&quot; but it could last for over ten years until the threat again to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , the first author Thomas Diet@@ rich from the English University Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; man must convince people of it , non @-@ smo@@ kers , the study manager H@@ einer Bo@@ eing from DI@@ f@@ E : smoking does not shor@@ ten the life time . &quot;
not too smoking is good for l@@ ungs and vessels and leads after our knowledge also to a good dental health to high age .
&quot; in Germany , more than 20 percent of the population at the age of 65 and 74 have been affected by dental pl@@ ess@@ ness , the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early dental care .
the new long @-@ term study w@@ alled the evidence .

&quot; &quot; &quot; for the shar@@ p@@ ation of the strike on the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement TTIP , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arb@@ iter system . &quot;
&quot; the contro@@ versi@@ al private sc@@ ure facilities for disputes between companies and states should therefore be dis@@ solved by a transparent system , which in its function is significantly more traditional dishes . &quot;
&quot; we want to establish a system that distr@@ ust the citizens , &quot; explained the competent EU Commissioner Cec@@ ilia Mal@@ m@@ strö@@ m from the presentation . &quot;
Sweden has decided to engage the proposal as a European negoti@@ ation position in the US @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ ties with the US .
the German government announced its support .
&quot; TTIP must be the largest free @-@ trade zone of the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings looked concre@@ t@@ ely ahead that the EU states and the USA have shared independent judges for a new investment court . &quot;
they are supposed to be equal parts from the EU to the USA and from third countries .
it is intended for the first time also a second instance .
it would allow it to lift against jud@@ g@@ ments .
&quot; to date , the procedure involved with each other on refer@@ ee , an exter@@ mination against their jud@@ g@@ ments did not exist . &quot;
&quot; in the discussion of the past months , it became clear that citizens became the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fair@@ ness and fair@@ ness not familiar , commented mal@@ m@@ strö@@ m . &quot;
&quot; in the long run , she wants to work according to one of its own information on the International Investment Court . &quot;
there could be clari@@ fied also for instance between Chinese companies and EU states .
the arbit@@ ral arbit@@ ral ( IS@@ DS ) above all shall be considered one of the main reasons for the major resistance in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional conserv@@ atory are cri@@ tici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of Parall@@ el adjust@@ ing without under@@ taking tax@@ pay@@ ers of tax@@ pay@@ ers to push national laws or reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP @-@ organisations like Camp@@ act the proposals made by the European Commission as in@@ sufficient . &quot;
critic@@ ised the contract has not been critic@@ ised for the free trade agreements with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) .
the German economic state Minister Matthias F@@ nig ( SPD ) recorded the plans on the other hand as great progress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission considered essential points to reform essential points , the Federal Minister of Sig@@ mar Gabriel in spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als be from the table .
the French government welcome the plans of Mal@@ m@@ strö@@ m .
&quot; the European corporation B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE war@@ ned to , to restri@@ ct the loc@@ alisation of the economy by too many new rules . &quot;
&quot; especially small and medium enterprises could be dis@@ advantaged , the name of it was . &quot;
&quot; when the talks about the free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded on Wednesday , continued . &quot;
the negotiations have been running since the middle of 2013 .
but the topic of investors has not been discussed with the United States too .
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is no longer available .
Del@@ ic@@ ater Folk of Su@@ fj@@ an St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ ck@@ an St@@ ev@@ ens sitting on the stage at the Köl@@ ner Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
&quot; beside him there is a fli@@ p@@ chart , which has recorded the sh@@ y @-@ up tor@@ rec@@ essed with the picturesque US state Michigan with filter@@ ing pen . &quot;
&quot; the whole audience , about 40 persons , is almost imposed by St@@ ev@@ ens lecture . &quot;
&quot; he relates to various places , which he will always show again on the map to tell about his min@@ u@@ ci@@ ous and tender . &quot;
&quot; where they were created , and how it looks there , in his homeland . &quot;
ever since then St@@ ev@@ ens proves to be wonderful creative mis@@ rer .
&quot; with the 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; &quot; published smart compos@@ ed songs which can harmon@@ i@@ ously very close to American Folk of the late six@@ ties , but at any time into great op@@ ul@@ ent dri@@ fting . &quot;
&quot; it arises from the sm@@ ells , &quot; Michigan &quot; &quot; would be the first part of a ver@@ able series : each of the 50 US federal states into effect . &quot;
&quot; but after 2004 and in the Rhine , seven Sw@@ ans already appeared and it breaks a positive expectations . &quot;
reduced the St@@ ev@@ ens here on .
live matches him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later the musician returns to the series in New York .
with &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ fj@@ an St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : COME on Fe@@ el The Il@@ men@@ oise &quot; ) will be released in 2005 a surface @-@ wide master@@ piece .
flo@@ ating on ideas and stylish fin@@ esse .
the album rises up in the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in no y@@ early overview of the influ@@ ential musical media .

&quot; this sixth studio album was still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , however by program@@ med sequ@@ ences or Be@@ ats and plays with all the effect and hall . &quot;
&quot; long ago , the smaller clubs are cli@@ pped , the stage shows here for the colorful spect@@ acle from Ne@@ on @-@ front@@ lets and large fluor@@ es@@ cent Bü@@ hn@@ er . &quot;

&quot; although here nearly 2000 guests have b@@ anned in their chairs , returns the clearly ir@@ rit@@ es St@@ ev@@ ens back to in@@ timacy and the Folk . &quot;
&quot; without having a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians plays with the wide enrich@@ ed album . &quot;
&quot; from the audience you hear : the lecture is &quot; &quot; op@@ ul@@ ent &quot; &quot; and you can see the &quot; &quot; CD &quot; &quot; in essence . &quot;

Jer@@ em@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns Debut of the prime minister of the Prime Minister
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut in the ques@@ tioning of the Prime Minister with voltage is expected .
&quot; the new Labour Chair of Jer@@ em@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n should give his debut in the ques@@ tioning of the Prime Minister , and to settle for the first time with David Cameron . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask for the first of his six weeks questions shortly after noon , taking his performance from the media and the Labour voice will probably be examined . &quot;
he called &quot; less theat@@ res and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he can jump out some sessions to leave them colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ ort@@ ing and his speech on the TU@@ C anniversary event on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the decision of the Labour Chairman , on Tuesday during the Sing@@ ing of the National hy@@ m@@ ne during a comm@@ em@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the battle of Britain in silence to har@@ sh , criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs pro@@ vo@@ z@@ ated and is at the center of several refl@@ ections stories in the newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision , not to sing the National hy@@ m@@ ne , has moved attention to herself . &quot;
&quot; a speaker of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said , he could have been &quot; in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; and he made the &apos; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the avi@@ ation around England . &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told on the BBC Two news@@ night program , he made the Labour voice that should sing National hy@@ mn , regardless of his belief that the mon@@ archy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; a do@@ zen of shadow &apos;s sor@@ ties have been den@@ ied to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns top @-@ team , and they also calls for differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a six parliamentary party initially supported him as a guide . &quot;
&quot; the Political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also st@@ acking within the Labour &quot; and &quot; according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns statements of the position to the European Union and its limitation . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference that Labour changes ahead to remove the whole idea of a limitation .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ labour and coun@@ sell@@ ors that the party &apos; was very clear , be that they only thre@@ aten the limit of 26.@@ 000 £ to € 23.@@ 000 £ . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth labor president , who has since David Cameron , since he has since been a T@@ ory boss , over the last decade about the Dis@@ patch box in parliament . &quot;
&quot; the Labour Chair , who promised another policy letter , says that he has given &quot; Cro@@ w@@ d @-@ s@@ ourc@@ ed &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and given him more than 30.@@ 000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; Isl@@ ington North MP has said that the ques@@ tioning of the Prime Minister is to confront@@ ed with resist@@ ors &quot; and that he made both &quot; stroke &quot; and the riding with with@@ h@@ ooks , and instead are made to concentrate on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , the shadow &apos;s t@@ eller committee will be represented , if he is not divided - for example if Mr Cameron comes across from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea to the interview that other colleagues occasionally sei@@ ze the word , and that he John Ber@@ cow , the spok@@ es@@ man of the House , addressed to the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he was leader in 2005 leader , Mr Cameron wants to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le the@@ aters &quot; , &quot; which often reflects with the ques@@ tionna@@ ire of the Prime Minister . but a few years later he sp@@ ake that he failed in it . &quot;
&quot; since they was sent to television first in 1990 , the ques@@ tionna@@ ire was given to the Prime Minister as the most important Bar@@ ometer of his leadership and his leadership in the House of Commons and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his parliamentary elections , although cri@@ tics have ar@@ gu@@ ed to become a car@@ ic@@ ature and for@@ sake the reforms . &quot;

Po@@ unds comes to growth in the United Kingdom through acceler@@ ated pay@@ roll in the United Kingdom
&quot; the pound is rising according to data , which show a rise in the pay@@ roll of the United Kingdom . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 has been increased by the W@@ ot@@ s@@ ziel SA@@ BM@@ iller . &quot;
between May and July the result grew without bonuses in the United Kingdom at 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same pre @-@ year period .
this percentage has been the fast@@ est since 2009 and brought the reviews about the time of an interest .
the pound is increased by more than 1 % against the dollar on $ 1,@@ 55@@ 05 and was up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro on 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € . &quot;
the FT@@ SE 100 Index completed with an increase in 1.@@ 49 % on 6.@@ 229@@ ,@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a le@@ ap of 20 % , after the acquisition of the Riv@@ age AB In@@ Be@@ v . &quot;
&quot; one transaction would be the two largest brewer@@ ies in the world and combine brands such as Bu@@ er , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
b@@ lower shares were looking for encouraging messages from the competition for Luxury Goods and Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % higher .
&quot; right @-@ to @-@ the latest sales figures , all expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for mani@@ fold - growth dec@@ lined . &quot;
&quot; shares of Gl@@ enc@@ ore rose by 5 % , after the mining sil@@ ently said that he was 2.5 billion on by a stock market as part of its strategy of debt relief . &quot;
&quot; the shares of the packaging and paper group MON@@ DI were the biggest lo@@ sers on the index , and this with a fall by 4.4 % , after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had to sell his estimate for the rating rating &quot; rating &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; J@@ D Sports rose by 3,@@ 1 % , after the sport @-@ time company had reported a pre @-@ tax result of 46.@@ 6 million . &quot;
the chef from J@@ D Sports says that higher wages are approxim@@ ate the expansion .
&quot; the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter C@@ ow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK @-@ workers &quot; mean more merch@@ ant in the pockets of the potential customers . &quot;
&quot; but it is un@@ likely that this will be the higher labour costs in his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the cost could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs . &quot;

PE@@ GI@@ DA @-@ post@@ ers brings the Leb@@ an@@ illa on Pot@@ atoes @-@ idea
pot@@ atoes or do@@ da@@ er ?
&quot; it goes both - and indeed in the pot@@ ato pat@@ ons , developed by the Ol@@ den@@ burger Im@@ bis@@ s@@ bes@@ car@@ ver Han@@ i Al@@ h@@ ay . &quot;
&quot; inspired by the Sp@@ ru@@ ch &quot; pot@@ ato &quot; &quot; on a poster of the PE@@ GI@@ DA movement , Al@@ h@@ ay pot@@ ato , and meat together put together into a sp@@ ie@@ e . &quot;
&quot; the idea brought him a poster with a PE@@ GI@@ DA demonstration with the in@@ scription &quot; pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ ön@@ ders , &quot; which he had seen by chance on TV . &quot;
&quot; since then , in his store a bar@@ bec@@ u@@ ary turns with meat and pot@@ atoes . &quot;
&quot; this is mul@@ tic@@ a for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ h@@ ay . &quot;
the idea of the Leb@@ an@@ ric may now be in Munich in the patent office in Munich .
there they are protected according to the authority of the authority as a manual pattern .
&quot; how much meat and how much pot@@ atoes the sp@@ ie@@ ß contains , Al@@ h@@ ay wants to be betra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; only as much : &quot; &quot; it is doing so much better , &quot; he finds . &quot;
even at his customers the culinary journ@@ alist of international understanding can also be achieved .
Met@@ ering will start on @-@ line campaign to combat the Al@@ di@@ - In@@ inf@@ estation .
Met@@ alle tries to protect Ig@@ A stores in front of an Al@@ di @-@ In@@ mar@@ sch in South Australia and Western Australia .
food @-@ wholesale / cash launched a ground @-@ campaign launched to defend the market share of Ig@@ A retail@@ er in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di has prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in the beginning of next year , strengthen Met@@ ax@@ and Ig@@ A @-@ supermarkets to strengthen relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand Ig@@ A by ma@@ instre@@ am Marketing and Marketing on Social Media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show . &quot;
Ig@@ A @-@ dealers and suppliers jump on board with brands such as ice manufacturer Sim@@ mo from Dun@@ s@@ borough which sell in Ig@@ A @-@ stores samples and shop owners who sell their cheap tickets for the South Australian football stadium in tre@@ ad clients .
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ alle will be released for more details of its defence strategy on 29 September , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and devices cros@@ ses its annual investors strategy . &quot;
there is much at stake from as South Australia and Western Australia almost 30 percent of Met@@ cas@@ hs Ig@@ A @-@ stores and make higher profit mar@@ gins as a met@@ cas@@ cade Ig@@ A network in the East states .
&quot; purchas@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ or@@ ically provin@@ cial and Ig@@ A retail@@ er have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queens@@ land - more than 30 percent in Western Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to approximately 14 percent in eastern countries . &quot;
&quot; however , analy@@ sts such as Morgan Stan@@ ley that Al@@ di twelve months after opening his first markets out about five percent of the food market in these two states , and all existing players will take away from an independent retail@@ er sellers . &quot;
&quot; a report published in this week , according to the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath by Morgan Stan@@ ley that Ig@@ A @-@ retail@@ er 360 $ million sales in year and Met@@ fa 250 million will lose $ to the end of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this pro@@ gn@@ osis is based on the acceptance that Al@@ di has opened 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA , and generates sales of € 500 million and 600 million in each market . &quot;
&quot; the loss of food and grocery and in quantities of met@@ cas@@ hs high fixed base , Met@@ ry could cost around 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time Met@@ fa market shares in East @-@ states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Ro@@ y Morgan suggests that Ig@@ A purchas@@ er are the tre@@ pid@@ ation . &quot;
Morgan Stan@@ ley takes that Met@@ v@@ hs increases sales in food and grocery around 3.@@ 8 per cent in 2016 by percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2016 will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to € 10.6 per cent by 2020 .
&quot; last week told the leading Fond@@ s@@ managers Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , with a business eating in Melbourne that Met@@ alle will likely will disappear within a decade . Met@@ ele will disappear . &quot;
Met@@ abol@@ reserves it to respond publicly on the comments from Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it will assume that a pre @-@ level member of Met@@ ali with Mr Dou@@ glass has started to contact Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; IG@@ As market share has dec@@ lined from 18 percent to 14 percent , and registered from Met@@ v@@ hs foods and food trading , which has been around 1,@@ 200 Ig@@ A @-@ retail@@ er , has since 2012 rose by 43 percent , which reflects the operative improvement of simultaneous pressure on turnover and mar@@ gins . &quot;
&quot; however , the wholes@@ aler er@@ ect itself and invested more than 150 million dollars to selling tickets with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ ec@@ ths in hundreds of products each week at the same and Ig@@ A @-@ retailers while improving their shops through faster growing fresh food and deliver a better selection of high @-@ label foods . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ v@@ hs leading business leaders Ian Mor@@ ri@@ ce says that the prize pools and charging programs can be st@@ aged at Elan and hopes that the wholes@@ aler in 2017 will return for the first time in 2017 for the first time in four years . &quot;
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis courts Steve He@@ aly
bro@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves more praise than criticism for its behaviour .
&quot; Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ater@@ al damages &quot; &quot; in the short@@ est storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gi@@ os and deserves more praise of the President of the Australian tennis , Steve He@@ aly more praise than criticism for his own behaviour . &quot;
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is always called &quot; Special K@@ s &quot; , &quot; geri@@ es with St@@ an W@@ aw@@ rin@@ ka with St@@ an W@@ aw@@ rin@@ ka at the Montreal Masters in the spot@@ light . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ry@@ an Har@@ rison had to be separated by the arbit@@ rator due to the arbit@@ rator due to the arbit@@ rator due to : &quot; W@@ aw@@ rin@@ ka would suggest , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was recently seen how he was sm@@ elled a tennis rack@@ et , after a cr@@ ap@@ t has turned into a potential US Open @-@ victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , co@@ de@@ acon@@ is was def@@ ended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glas@@ gow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth in competition with Sam Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup fin@@ als against the UK . &quot;
&quot; one thing about which I am quite tri@@ cky , is the fact that after my opinion dar@@ dy was put into place a little in the dispute , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a bat , when he has broken through a struggle in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has had a bat from Fr@@ ust to himself , and I know Than@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of that . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he really beh@@ ave in the US Open extremely well , even among the pretty pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think that he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a fantastic team around him , he has a great family around themselves , and I believe that he was treated a little too high . &quot;
&quot; he is a very rei@@ er 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he has never been a problem with the other players , he is practic@@ ed hard , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I believe it deserves to be judged by his own where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supports the decision , Kyr@@ y at the important decision decision which begins on Friday and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right for everyone , but he saves the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term fixed part in the team . &quot;
&quot; first , we wish that the team is fully focused on the competition and not all the contro@@ vers@@ y around &#91; C@@ yr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; and I believe that Nick had made very quickly the A@@ scen@@ sion , which he has been aware of how Feder@@ er and Murray . he goes down in the eyes of the public , but we tried to support him , but we try to give him the consequences of his action . some time outside the spot@@ light , in which he can only think about it , I think it is best for the team and it is best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe re@@ fuge@@ e crisis : Hungary explains state , clos@@ es the border , keeps refugees back &quot;

&quot; in the coming days talks with Brussels and other countries , I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence at the hung@@ arian @-@ Ser@@ bian border came to a day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ block for a contro@@ versi@@ al meeting in Brussels .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people who would re@@ fu@@ ge all over Italy and Greece . they oppressed their hope that finally , next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU @-@ States would include another 1@@ 20.000 refugees , including some of Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday a special ap@@ ples of the European Union to discuss the immig@@ rant crisis of the continent .
Hungary did not put his hopes for a return action of Brussels or from his neighb@@ ors .
&quot; the emergency relief in two southern regions gave authority more powers to cope with the crisis , so they could speed up streets ab@@ iding and asylum . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to said , that his country also has the construction of a stand @-@ wi@@ red along its border with Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants across the country - after reaching a fence on the Ser@@ bian border . &quot;
CB@@ S News @-@ correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison @-@ counting on the race @-@ run @-@ fence between Hungary and Serbia have been used .
&quot; in recent months , Hungary is for many war @-@ refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East to a considerable rap@@ ass and to the entrance door to the European Union . &quot;
&quot; Minister Viktor Or@@ ban has however , however , that most of the coming economic migrants are looking for a better life and not war migrants , are entitled to protect against protection - a view that is strong in contradiction to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which came in force around midnight in Hungary ( 13 feet ) high fence , led the border along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws also place higher cust@@ ody for condem@@ ned human tra@@ ff@@ ick@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; because of the situation that emerged through the mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the state of state , &quot; said speaker z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs Re@@ por@@ tern in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree to the use of the military still today , which is expected for next week , but Re@@ porter of Associ@@ ated Press reported at the border difficult to armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ org@@ y Bak@@ on@@ di , land @-@ security consultant for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others were already penet@@ rated deeply into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come through , by def@@ ending the fence , they are now in police , and shall be acc@@ used of criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws . &quot;
authorities are here to rep@@ aired the fence quickly .
&quot; Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning , two of the seven bor@@ dered transi@@ tions with Serbia , after a tractor with tri@@ m dra@@ in to close the borders , arrived . &quot;
chaos then gave the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal containers to process the data of people and oppressed people to get there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 managed to reach it , but thousands were remained outside . &quot;
&quot; another group of migrants block@@ ed the most important highway combination of Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse to eat food and water until they travel to Hungary . &quot;
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clin@@ bus@@ tion before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in the national survey
&quot; the former US Secretary of Hill@@ ary Clinton furthermore remains a two @-@ dig@@ it lead in the democratic race to nom@@ ination at the national level , but sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ ander wins their opposite to the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton is now the support of 47 percent of democratic voters with the previous elections ( 58 percent previously ) , while being second in second place , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet been pro@@ claimed if he supported for the presidential system , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the beginning of the elections , say most democratic voters that it &apos;s too early to say that their opinion stands out for which candidates are to support them . &quot;
but Clin@@ t suppor@@ ters are available in their election as those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the CB@@ S News survey , Clinton had lost a number of dem@@ ographic groups , while being achieved some wins . &quot;
Clinton holds a big advantage in women and suffering , but this jum@@ ps have reduced . &quot;
&quot; your support in the men has dec@@ lined significantly , and yet here is only with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ t &apos;s advantage in democratic gas generators under 50 years has fle@@ eting , and they are now on the same height . &quot;
but Clinton have still a big advantage with the older voters .
&quot; last month , Clinton recently was S@@ anders with two @-@ dig@@ it lead in liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
&quot; about half of the democratic voters of the elections , they would say that they would assist with enthusiasm to assist him from the party . &quot;
&quot; one quarter would keep it with some plans , and another 15 percent would just support it because they are the nomin@@ ee . &quot;
six percent would not support them .
maybe not surprising that Clin@@ t current suppor@@ ters are especially excited from her .
&quot; the views are stronger at those who currently not support Clinton - just about a quarter would it be delighted . &quot;
&quot; whereas 48 per cent of the democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections are saying that they also assist Clinton with enthusiasm , say l@@ esser Repub@@ li@@ can of Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
when Clin@@ t suppor@@ ters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candi@@ d@@ ine that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it &apos;s time is that a woman president is ( 13 percent ) and that it is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
the Clin@@ t Support@@ ed supports its connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
&quot; consent to the handling of problems and laundry , also quoted . &quot;
&quot; as the Vice President has thro@@ wing an potential for the presidential system , would like to see 57 percent of the democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections in the race - although a third believes it should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters have asked the pre @-@ elections , who would be the second choice for the party is Bi@@ den at the top . &quot;
&quot; by Clin@@ t &apos;s trailers would say more than half , that bi@@ ds would be far ahead of it . &quot;
&quot; decide to run Bi@@ den , not for the nom@@ ination of Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clin@@ t Clin@@ t increases before S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in competitions on 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; five @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate , having the best opportunities to win the election ; however , this figure is dropped from 78 percent in the last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in that measurement , but the percentage that arose him as the &quot; &quot; voting &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , during the question then , what is more important in one candidate , the democrati@@ s@@ able voters have questions about the laundry . &quot;
&quot; similarly as last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters of the pre @-@ elections is un@@ acceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates have good results in some important characteristics of the voters of their party .
&quot; maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and with powerful leaders . &quot;
&quot; bi@@ ds cuts down among the three candidates most from hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ t strength is the lead . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of it . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ological in accordance with their views . &quot;
with all these measurements about a quarter of the democratic voters do not have any opinion of being .
&quot; as questions about Hill@@ ary Clin@@ tons may continue to be placed on a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term as a State Department , most of the Democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions in total . &quot;
but it is another story in the American public .
&quot; half of the Americans now is dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about a third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; the public opinion of this was in March , shortly after the problem came to light , split . &quot;
&quot; most Americans told that the e @-@ mail contro@@ vers@@ y have no effect on their general opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion of her still deteri@@ or@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; they are mostly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who are saying that their views are worse from Clinton . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is seen by the voters of their party as honest and trust@@ worthy , this will continue to be a problem for them among registered constitu@@ encies of a total : only 32 per cent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of the elig@@ ible voters do not keep them for a honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time 55 percent of the leg@@ alists are also very honest and trust@@ worthy as not honest and not trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tru@@ mp receive good notes on leadership .
&quot; by the six leading candidates were cut down Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush at the best in hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards as honest , but as at Car@@ son many do not have any opinion of him . &quot;
the Troub@@ leshooting for the sample of 351 Democratic Kamp@@ iz@@ ers at the pre @-@ elections is 6 percent@@ ages .
Ben Car@@ son consider@@ ate at nation@@ wide survey close to Donald Tru@@ mp
Ben Car@@ son is the latest survey of CB@@ S News / New York Times closely behind Donald Tru@@ mp
&quot; at the two candidates the half of the support of voters in the new pol@@ l , and others have dramatically changed at H@@ alt . &quot;
&quot; Repub@@ li@@ can wh@@ ist@@ ers support nation@@ wide continues Tru@@ mp in large numbers . the support is growing at 23 % in the last CB@@ S survey , which was conducted by Fox News debate last month , at 27 % in the survey from Tuesday . &quot;
but Car@@ son sch@@ lap in the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well connected with dem@@ ographic groups well and Tru@@ mp under Repub@@ li@@ can voters with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , except for Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Govern@@ or John Kas@@ ich , crossed Scott Wal@@ ker , who is at the deep@@ est , and lasts 10 % support during the last month at now 2 % . &quot;
the former Florida Govern@@ or J@@ eb Bush , the former govern@@ or of Ark@@ ans@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida @-@ Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio there are 6 % on the third place . &quot;
the fault of deb@@ ts in the sample of 376 persons of Repub@@ li@@ can sc@@ aling in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , shows that Car@@ son rises in the surveys - he lan@@ es at 19 % support in the repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support . &quot;
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post showed tru@@ mp clearly before Car@@ son .
&quot; looking at one in the last week of rising Car@@ son , Tru@@ mp took some side @-@ hi@@ ers for the former neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ ons , even after Car@@ son attemp@@ ted to ask tru@@ mp@@ s faith in question . &quot;
&quot; we need energy &quot; , &quot; Tru@@ mp said last Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently warm up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even though peak values are measured only in distance distance , enough for seaside vac@@ ations have already a trip to the Mediterranean to find still warm water . &quot;
a bath in North or Baltic Sea is likely to be a short @-@ short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; man@@ cher is not going to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees , the water at the North and Baltic Sea during this week , shares the German Wetter@@ dienst ( D@@ WD ) . &quot;
&quot; bathing temperatures , on the other hand , continues to offer the Mediterranean Sea : in the east it comes even up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; on the Adriatic are at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes on 28 degrees .
five members of the Br@@ other@@ hood with the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ ings
&quot; almost two years , after a student at a rail connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , will be submitted conc@@ ed@@ ed against five people . &quot;
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Br@@ other@@ hood of Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during a introduc@@ tory pri@@ g@@ ary in September 2013 and de@@ ed his transport into hospital in which he contributed to his death , shared the police . &quot;
&quot; officials told , he may be loaded with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repe@@ aled and repe@@ aled , while he tried to go over a fro@@ zen field on a goal . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g cl@@ ag@@ led eventually about head@@ aches , then it fell un@@ conscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Br@@ other@@ hood was not the emergency number 911 to den@@ ied and wa@@ ited an hour before they brought him into a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes to conf@@ use his symptoms , and Andy Men@@ g to put the national President of the Br@@ other@@ hood , to seek advice , said Pol@@ ishing Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point the members , U@@ ten@@ sil began to hide and put the welfare of the Br@@ other@@ hood on a fundament@@ ally about that by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ v@@ ef Wagner . &quot;
he could not re revi@@ ved and he died off the next morning to his inj@@ uries .
&quot; after an Autop@@ report , Den@@ g repeatedly have been repeated with st@@ um@@ ed strength violations in head , tor@@ so and thig@@ h . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Sch@@ ik@@ anen of the Br@@ other@@ hood . at least a student dies since 1970 each year at the Sch@@ ik@@ anen , &quot; said Dou@@ glas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer of the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; breaking @-@ ups and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe received a indic@@ t@@ ment for the first five members .
&quot; two @-@ thirty members of the Br@@ other@@ hood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also indic@@ ted for shi@@ ply attacks and education of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to blame the people involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or in@@ sig@@ ly - this s@@ ank@@ ed , we will also draw this to account , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Bar@@ uch College is b@@ anned the Br@@ other@@ hood , and the national Br@@ other@@ hood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the town@@ group . &quot;
that will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; a f@@ ad sec@@ ts comes , and the house will come into the cu@@ ff , ren@@ amed for bonds , and the economy will slide into a recession . &quot;
this is what we know .
what we don &apos;t know how long this will last and how long it will last .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy has only low instructions for the procedure . &quot;
a recession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the ag@@ gres@@ siv@@ ity of the Federal Reserve at the lifting of interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in such as the economy and the financial concerns . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the U.S. central bank have so intense that investors should not focus on when it starts to increase interest rates , but rather on the period of norm@@ alization for norm@@ alization . &quot;
in fact several variables play a role .
&quot; in the end could market participants , however , that the whole excitement was un@@ ger@@ ated because of a f@@ ad , possibly excessive . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is being interpreted as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jess@@ op , Ch@@ ef@@ ö@@ kon@@ om near Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still at the lowest level to cause the sei@@ sm@@ ic shock , to lead the many to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effects . &quot;
here is a look at the historical trend based on how some areas of the economy could respond :
&quot; as the market seen in the last month , the anticip@@ ation of Z@@ inser@@ ts things can make things for a while . &quot;
&quot; once the increase in one , the influence is not as dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there are apparently a tendency that pro@@ long@@ ing from 12 to 24 months after the first increase in which perhaps the delay in monetary policy reflects , &quot; said Deutsche Bank Analy@@ sts in a newer study to what happened after inser@@ ts in the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; more specifically , the market has mostly been up@@ ward in the past 35 years - about 14 per cent in the up@@ ward trend , quite flat in the 250 days later ( average profit of 2,@@ 6 percent ) , then back to the normal state after 500 days , with average return in the past six past cycles of 14,@@ 4 percent according to a recent analysis , the Bob Doll , head plant Strateg@@ e near Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s published . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares are expected later in the increase cycle and the return of returns will begin to decrease .
&quot; rec@@ es@@ sions are a fact of economic life , but as f@@ ad anc@@ ements they promote it often . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that were previously un@@ covered and can accelerate a recession . &quot;
extremely remarkable is here that the gross domestic product can be found close to its lowest point in a f@@ ad plac@@ ation of the F@@ ed .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 zep@@ ad decre@@ ases since 1950 alone was only twice the nominal b@@ IP at 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3,@@ 6 percent expected that this and@@ au@@ ers will expect and expect the third quarter to the Atlan@@ ta F@@ ed only 1,5 percent . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ts in such frag@@ mentary economic back@@ drop may be ris@@ ky and cast the question , &quot; whether this time it is different , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants took the whole year on a tariff of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many shr@@ ub@@ bles and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC would like an increase in this meeting , the fut@@ ures are only a prob@@ ability of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study all boo@@ sting cycles of 1950 to the present have taken place in a super @-@ cycle with increasing moment@@ um when B@@ IP took place and on @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ing very fast after the start of relaxation in the shadow , &quot; thus the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly long recovery of what the worst recession in the observed phase was . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the lon@@ gest , who has wa@@ ited the F@@ ed since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has so far 74 months . &quot;
&quot; the fixed income was also vol@@ ati@@ l , since the market plays a f@@ ad sec@@ ration , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
&quot; the main difference is that the effect at bonds is faster than with shares , when making their strategic course . &quot;
bonds appear the ren@@ dering the direction as soon as the first increase in lower@@ ing in the cycle shall occur .
&quot; at the end of the In@@ cre@@ ase cycle , the sei@@ zur@@ es attack immediately , said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; the shr@@ ub@@ s by Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates will bring that ren@@ amed between longer and shorter bonds , and lead to a cle@@ aring of the curve . &quot;
&quot; bonds often bring something in such a climate better income , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher y@@ ields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fix@@ ed @-@ Income @-@ Analy@@ st at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; interesting , &quot; says Jones , that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation forecast , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of more str@@ ingent policy . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates are increased , the contr@@ actor has gone out , cre@@ ams have risen and volumes generated - all characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed has intensi@@ fied their strategy . &quot;
&quot; in the large and whole companies that enter the larger part of their operations in the US , benefit from interest rates and local products are more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multin@@ ational companies with high debt will be worse , since an ending dollar off their products on the global market is more expensive and just the financing of their deb@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality - &quot; shares tend to be very positive after three months after an initial tick bite , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analy@@ sts in a report for customers . &quot;
&quot; company with strong balance sheet made companies with f@@ rail balance after each of the tick bite from 1994 , 1999 and 2004 at an average of 5 percentage points . &quot;
companies with high capital @-@ ren@@ ters as well as low volumes with their shares also sur@@ passes their counter@@ parts with low quality at the average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
deb@@ ts are a big problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates are most lose but the gold stated .
consumers will also benefit from the rising dollars .
&quot; saving you could see profits through higher y@@ ields , even if experts are different from different opinion , how quickly this will take place . &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Houses of Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham
the conserv@@ ative member of the Parliament cri@@ tici@@ zed the transm@@ itter due to its &quot; &quot; desp@@ air &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly different from commercial ri@@ vals .
he pointed to the BBC Music Awards and said that it was only The Br@@ its im@@ iti@@ st
EP @-@ Kol@@ stad Dam@@ ien Collin@@ s entered the show The Voice and said that this is not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; turned out to Classic FM , maint@@ ains a leading parliamentary committee and increases new pressure on the transm@@ itter , prove that he is doing something what the private documents do not do . &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ atives of Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham also said the BBC Bos@@ sen , that the publicly @-@ legal radio @-@ book &quot; &quot; du@@ mb &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be different from its commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; Radio 3 seems - I use the word &quot; &quot; dum@@ my &quot; &quot; - but it seems to transform Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot;
he also included the BBC Music Awards which started last December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year seem to be The Br@@ its just under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so if you are trying to do something else - these are two spont@@ aneous examples , where you actually only have to im@@ itate what is already on the market &quot; , &quot; Mr B@@ ing@@ ham . &quot;
&quot; BBC @-@ General Director dism@@ is@@ sed and ar@@ gu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 far ahead of its commercial competitors , if it comes to live music and clari@@ fication of the public . &quot;
what I learn from Radio 3 I will learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that really un@@ sur@@ passed .
&quot; and the commitment of radio 3 , to find new music and give new works in order , I also really consider for important &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year ar@@ gu@@ ed BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey , that harder to work on it to get the audience than it did in the past because the British are less about classical music . &quot;
&quot; but Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production , which during the hearing at the Committee for the selection of culture , media and sport for them under fire , the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory @-@ MP Dam@@ ien Collin@@ s took the Voice to - the musical talent @-@ show at the BBC , which was bought by the Dutch magazine Tal@@ pa Media for estimated costs of 22 million £ . &quot;
&quot; see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not especially distinctive ? &quot;
Lord Hall consi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Fa@@ ith and Boy George as a judge - &quot; in particular BBC @-@ way . &quot;
&quot; he added , he would like the company &quot; hit a hit from our homemade barn &quot; , &quot; if the next time it start a entertain@@ er series . &quot;
&quot; however , he ref@@ used to exclu@@ de the order of other ranks of The Voice in the Future , or give money back to money pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats . &quot;
Internet revenues in August at slow and the Black Friday may be responsible for this
it was seven percent increase in online sales in the first three months of 2015 .
in the last month the lowest result since the start of records in 2000
online @-@ sales increased three years ago by the use of phones to shop
experts believe that the Black Friday has brak@@ ed the expenditure on November Friday
&quot; for over a decade , the virtual shopping mot@@ om@@ ed , and many of the main shopping streets of Great Britain have turned into spirits . &quot;
experts say that there are no sign that the online conver@@ sions are st@@ agn@@ ated after new numbers only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure on August presented the lowest rise in growth since the start of records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales st@@ agn@@ es after new numbers only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for pre @-@ years and go until 2000 , this has always been developing in the course of time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales representative . &quot;
&quot; he explained that the online sales is reinforced from three years ago , as a buyer to make sure with their hand purchases . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now this one , and we will possibly experience that growth is decre@@ ased . &quot;
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon that was import@@ ed from America as a reason for the in@@ let turnover .
experts believe that buyers have their purchases before this event that takes place last Friday in November .
&quot; in the past year , five times the average number of buyers to make their computer to make their snor@@ ing and some dealers . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyer could hold off for bran@@ dy , buyer of it could make sure purchases . &quot;
a study of the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium found out that it was issued by 5 £ spending a little more than 1 £ online .
&quot; in some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now conducted on Web @-@ shops . &quot;
at the same time I buy more than a quarter of men clothing and shoes online instead of the Mo@@ dec@@ ine in the inner cities .

&quot; Saudi @-@ Official have already pointed out that the H@@ add@@ on to M@@ ec@@ ca with thousands , which will continue to come to the city , will continue to go . &quot;
&quot; today , King Sal@@ man said the B@@ in @-@ Laden @-@ group could not let the arm of the cranes were not used , when he was not used . &quot;
an Arabic version of Dec@@ rets that was published by the state Saudi Press Agency that the B@@ in @-@ Laden @-@ vote was responsible for the collapse .
&quot; the English @-@ speaking service of the news agency reported this detail , but said that the management of the company is not b@@ anned . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man will reveal what the over@@ throw of the sick , who raised up into an internal courtyard of the great mosque , where hundreds of Muslims took place in front of the H@@ add@@ on which later gathered later this month . &quot;
&quot; the B@@ in @-@ shop Group has no statements about the collapse of the sick , and their representatives were not available for an opinion . &quot;
&quot; the Royal Dec@@ ree also has the group due to its current security measures , and because they did not cooperate with Met@@ eor@@ ologists . &quot;
do@@ zens of t@@ ears surrounded by M@@ ek@@ kas &apos;s Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive construction project that is derived from the B@@ in charging group .
the B@@ in Laden &apos;s family has been linked to the sover@@ eign family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over larger construction projects .
&quot; the dec@@ eased leader of Al Q@@ a@@ eda , O@@ sam@@ a bin Laden , was a mur@@ derer son who was dischar@@ ged from the family in the 1990 @-@ year . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , just a few days prior to the arrival of millions in the kingdom for pilgri@@ mage , which is at least once in the life of any healthy Muslims . &quot;
officials spoke that 158 people stay in the hospital .
&quot; government representatives said that 1 million am ( £ 17@@ 4,@@ 000 ) to pay to the relatives of the relatives are to be paid and the same sum of permanent . &quot;
other verses receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Bos@@ s says that the time of cheap Eastern European ar@@ tis@@ ans are exempl@@ ary .
&quot; British employ increasingly crafts@@ men , said Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry &quot;
the number of qualified crafts@@ men from Eastern Europe has rising behind
&quot; this leads to that 200 other scre@@ am stores , which are aimed at hand @-@ des@@ ks , are opened . &quot;
at the same time King@@ fisher 60 B &amp; Q sales@@ men will close together
von Ru@@ pert Steiner , City Chef @-@ correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
&quot; it is claimed that British are holding their h@@ amm@@ ers and brush in favour of the use of qualified European crafts@@ men who carry out work in their home , &quot;
&quot; if you are sk@@ ill@@ fully with a hammer or a brush to extend the walls of walls , these days they seem to be a minority . &quot;
&quot; because Brit@@ ans are increasingly popular crafts@@ men , carrying out jobs in their homes , so the leader of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ér@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry , new business leader of King@@ fisher who own@@ s the tree @-@ markets , said that a major increase in the number of qualified ar@@ tis@@ ans from Eastern Europe , providing services to low rates may be over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
&quot; therefore , King@@ fisher , 200 other scre@@ am@@ fix shops can be opened to open up to ar@@ tis@@ ans and 60 outlets of B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said , she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten buying decisions in the shop are met by women . &quot;
&quot; in the moment , there are out@@ weig@@ h among the employees the men . &quot;
&quot; it said , it is necessary to face the growing dem@@ ographic trends , the more female single households , which make more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our stores .
we need to move more towards a balance .
&quot; basically , half of our clients consists of women with 80 percent of the decisions about the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a major role in decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry that is one of only five women in the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index published in order to reflect the same number of men and women in executive positions .
King@@ fisher is almost the only company that has occupied just 50 percent of the team with women including its management and financial support .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - variety is here an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ fisher swallow@@ ed a fall in the half @-@ year @-@ circuit and red@@ rop@@ ies after the group had the cost of the closing of the shops .
&quot; because of the trends is King@@ fisher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , 200 new branches . &quot;
working from A@@ ich / D@@ ob because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity before court
at the Landes@@ bank Kl@@ agen@@ furt met at the Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball Lec@@ turer A@@ I / D@@ ob because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and storage @-@ education .
the def@@ endants are not guil@@ ty .
one of them was also charged with bre@@ t@@ sm@@ iss@@ ants .
from this acc@@ us@@ ation he has been in force of force in May .
the current process was ad@@ mi@@ red .
&quot; according to Ober@@ sta@@ ats@@ an@@ walt Robert Ri@@ ells , expressed in pre @-@ investigations that acc@@ used the acc@@ used in the years 2006 to 2011 diplomatic cor@@ ds to disp@@ ose of them in their functions , for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; the damage caused by around 400@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the sports @-@ functional are also indic@@ ted for financial statements .
&quot; this fact divided the president of the closing of the op@@ ener , Micha@@ ela San@@ in , from . &quot;
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
&quot; to the ver@@ ishment of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence it represents that the association was at no time a asset . &quot;
&quot; the sports@@ men would have only applied administration to compens@@ ations and have been working for the sports club , for which they had been working from 1982 to 2011 and have invested a lot of time and money from the debt level - the pas@@ siv@@ va resi@@ des in 2001 around 600@@ .000 Sch@@ illing ( rd . 44.@@ 000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; then we were standing in front of the situation : do we continue the club or lock it , &quot; &quot; told one of the def@@ endants , in the bread@@ land of the financial officer . &quot;
he then decided to take this task with his colleagues and collabor@@ ators .
with all risks .
&quot; we have shed some money that sur@@ rounds our lifestyle as security in the bank , &quot; he said with the acceptance . &quot;
&quot; agreed with the association : you can manage the money , there must be no deb@@ ts . &quot;
further be - for appropriate financial success - the payout of administration by administration had been rati@@ fied by the end of 1991 .
&quot; therefore , one of the administration of administration is only re@@ comp@@ uted even years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus in the account has been paid . &quot;
&quot; therefore , also l@@ ump package and not detailed information on , explan@@ atory the former Ob@@ lig@@ ently explain the processes . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and lap@@ ses are managed together , the two cl@@ oned , said the second acc@@ used . &quot;
&quot; why the withdrawal of the association had not existed in detail , asked the judge . &quot;
&quot; the association has not been interested in detail for the financial crisis , it is important to be only the question of debt , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; as in 2011 against the one functioning of the investigation for am@@ t@@ sm@@ iss@@ ants , a amount of 1@@ 20.000 Euro was transferred to the association agreement . &quot;
that were def@@ ended , explained the def@@ endants . &quot;
this paper account will be running on the name of the second acc@@ used and was not yet known as a statement of the association .
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; I wanted to know the Jud@@ ator . &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the answer for a long time .
&quot; then he said he eventually , he believed that this is the best for the association . &quot;
&quot; when something happened to him , nobody would have known something of that money , the prosec@@ ut@@ or presented to the room . &quot;
the fellow @-@ def@@ ect have been kept informed of the functioning of the working class .
this transfer was formulated as &quot; Par@@ c@@ rest@@ ment . &quot;
why ind@@ em@@ nity ? they wanted to know the judge and state of prosec@@ ut@@ or .
&quot; there@@ on , the first acc@@ used , he may not agree with this wor@@ ding , because the association was never caused a damage . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do when the Samuel says : &quot; &quot; with this you are all out of the h@@ ook . &quot;
&quot; am I a judi@@ ci@@ ary ? &quot; , &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the functional , he never moved to a cent of sal@@ ary , he only calcul@@ ates od@@ ometer and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; at di@@ ets he added to the Club 1,000 Euro per month , the actual effort was however much higher , he added . &quot;
accurate documentation for the early years could not be vor@@ ced .
&quot; these are after a test test , in which everything was judged as accurate , no longer stated , they said . &quot;
od@@ ometer should also be referred to as the second acc@@ used .
&quot; all containers are in cash at that time , he must lead from his residence of international market to the Bank by Blei@@ burg , he explained in his statement . &quot;
the main proceedings will continue on September 23 with the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation of witnesses .

time of decision on interest rates for the US emergency
&quot; the world observed if the US emergency has been observed at two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , in order to meet the important decision whether for nearly a decade the interest are raised , or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey of 80 Ö@@ r@@ omen was ques@@ tioned by Reu@@ ters , found that a little more than half , the last week of the view was that the F@@ ed this will do , now thinks that the F@@ ed will do a little longer and hold the interest rates on the current state of 0 - 0,@@ 25 per cent . &quot;
&quot; it is a historical event , because it is seven years ago since the F@@ ed interest rates has continued to NU@@ LL . &quot;
&quot; for the first time we approach a situation in which a major central bank probably leaves the zero range and a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ de , Edit@@ orial staff at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. economy is due to a relatively good level of performance , billions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate just a small inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed does not ignore the less reliable outlook on global circumstances . &quot;
&quot; she has war@@ ned the markets to ex@@ ert an increase , but the signs suggest that the chances of such a step are good . &quot;
the decision should be announced at 8.@@ 00@@ pm CET on Thursday

&quot; after writing the note he was 300 miles on the Delta State University , where he took E@@ ane Schmidt , a professor of history , mort@@ ar before he eventually absor@@ bed his own life in the Monday evening , as police officers . &quot;
&quot; University President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said , he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs thought . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb suppos@@ edly believed that pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship to said authorities on Tuesday , there is no information , no evidence of a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who told she was about seven years married as a &quot; good human &quot; . &quot; &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can not play a month of dou@@ bling
Luke Sha@@ w er@@ ge at the Champions League &apos;s defeat of Manchester at the PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven have double pi@@ vot@@ al of his right leg .
&quot; as this the left external def@@ ender to wines and shut him out for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al will not show the hope that Sha@@ v can play again in this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after 20 years old Sha@@ w in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the playing field and he needed oxygen before he was put into hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double bott@@ om@@ ination and lies in the hospital . &quot;
he will move tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operates in Manchester .
&quot; it is terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has very heavy and then happens fantastic and then happens . &quot;
in the lo@@ cker he had a oxygen of oxygen .
he w@@ ept .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double Fra@@ ktur , then it takes six months and it will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be a Red Card and the im@@ position of a iv@@ ative .
Nicol@@ a R@@ izz@@ oli , the Arb@@ it@@ rato , has not pen@@ alized the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian refer@@ ee had been spirit@@ ually spirit@@ ually .
&quot; you can judge for yourself , when I say that a iv@@ ative and a red card were due . &quot;
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; a tweet on Sha@@ ws account is : &quot; &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I am getting stronger once more . &quot;
therein : Manchester United moves the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the defeat at PS@@ V
the England @-@ Def@@ en@@ ders in France has an additional incen@@ tive to recover up to the next June .
&quot; Phil@@ lip C@@ oc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very dirty violation . &quot;
&quot; when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an opponent .
Mor@@ eno has a leg to be played as Mexico against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; he does very difficult because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the opponent , and if you listen that there is a very sh@@ aw@@ ful violation , this is not good , &quot; said C@@ oc@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball , which was in a different direction , so it looked like he &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; fell to him , but I could not see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; talking with SB@@ S@@ 6 said Mor@@ eno : &quot; &quot; I know how it feels like it feels like hard to be . &quot;
I feel very bad here . I am sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ Player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ ding by Chris Sm@@ ol@@ y .
surely David Cameron The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is one thing that all parents soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not last long until you get to know it almost every . &quot;
&quot; unless , you might have David Cameron . &quot;
&quot; as he was asked from a provider of child care systems , his favorite children &apos;s book was asked to call themselves the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the 1971 Dic@@ tionary environment by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult election , writes Cameron in a message on the site of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , cre@@ atively , and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to present my children , because it seems to have a picture or message that we have so far missed . &quot;
&quot; everything beautiful and good , except that the subsequent paragraph , in the Cameron described the act of book , instead a contents of the movie version revealed , the new characters and details added to expand the fairly short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the w@@ alled city Th@@ un @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , hopes to win a boy named T@@ ed , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , whose desire came to see a real tree by his desire , whose real name Theod@@ or Se@@ uss viol@@ ated and the 1991 died , but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if that is not sus@@ pic@@ ious enough , that is presented by Cameron presented , sometimes in the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie which is presented on the web site Th@@ un @-@ Ville , where everything artificial and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy named T@@ ed , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he ad@@ mitt@@ edly there is an pr@@ ag@@ matic father , it seems un@@ likely that Cameron wants the action of the book so little familiar . here goes an un@@ en@@ ann@@ ess boy , like the local environment through the monetary union , trees at@@ ra@@ enden On@@ ce @-@ ler despite the prot@@ est of the nam@@ ens@@ ory Lor@@ ax , a mu@@ zzle ; pur@@ ging Being , &quot; that will be named in the name of trees . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a assistant that The Lor@@ ax does not read 20 times for a child after a child . &quot;
&quot; an Down@@ ing @-@ Street spok@@ es@@ person said , that the text probably came from Camer@@ ons of the vote . &quot;
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text of Camer@@ ons workers were delivered , but no further immediate comments . &quot;
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exp@@ ir@@ ation of England &apos;s team but it is still hard
&quot; to encounter in Pakistan in the United Arab Emir@@ ates , is a difficult task , but if you &apos;ve chosen the cad@@ res that England stands for the tour , is a repeti@@ tion of the 3 @-@ 0 test @-@ series do not defeat in my card . &quot;
I would not exclu@@ de a down@@ war@@ win .
&quot; Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks website may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the Batt@@ ing layout , and the common spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a youth@@ ful positive approach . &quot;
&quot; the ball develops on Mo@@ een Ali as a spin @-@ Bow@@ l and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on test level , is an option for attack . &quot;
above @-@ referred site : Adam Ly@@ th fail from England @-@ Test @-@ K@@ ader and replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; the decision to release Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his boss @-@ trainer in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyze . &quot;
&quot; with his seven tests , there were two good attacks on difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ minals are aimed at results . &quot;
&quot; there were no ques@@ tioning at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and this led to the nom@@ ination , since - and I had said this - players are their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; a long time ago you could have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own destiny . &quot;
&quot; if he will hopefully see more shopping for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ lis@@ s pra@@ ised his position , even if he did not put so good services and does not amaz@@ es me ; he is especially a team @-@ man . &quot;
&quot; the question , how much time a test stroke will get to place his character is difficult . &quot;
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - , while Nick Comp@@ ton nine got . &quot;
only Comp@@ ton got the chance for home and warm @-@ up games .
&quot; the only acc@@ us@@ ation that one can collect , was that England was first Jonathan the championship in the Caribbean - when Ly@@ th was in peak , but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot;
Alex H@@ ale comes in and he is a stroke that I found high .
&quot; he is a X @-@ factor Cri@@ tical player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season , when he met 236 against us at a Tr@@ ent Bridge place , what we met . &quot;
&quot; he must at least obtain the same opportunities as the before him , but this depends on the team &apos;s team results in the United Arab Emir@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; the idea , Mo@@ een near C@@ ook to let C@@ ook kno@@ ck out what an extra spin Bow@@ ler bring forth and four cross@@ ings , I emerged , and I have nothing about it . &quot;
&quot; I do not see why a stroke will not propose there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a Teu@@ fel@@ stisch of Cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een may not be done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my early teamwork J@@ ustin L@@ anger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he joined as Open@@ er .
he had made a three hundred month away and did not look back .
Z@@ af@@ ar An@@ s@@ ari comes into the cad@@ re as an back @-@ up sp@@ inner and in my limited use of it he impressed me as a young man .
people may see their statistics at the average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it is a flo@@ od but there is no great number of backup jum@@ pers who rise up their hands and have chosen the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team England had made a few clever additions to the trainer .
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ den@@ e , the Bat@@ sman from Sri Lanka , as consultants for the Test@@ games could be a master@@ piece . &quot;
he is one of the nic@@ est Ker@@ le of the game that will bring an abundance of experiences because he has played amongst all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use in the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he is created for the international Cri@@ cket contest , as a player or as Coach , and such as Mah@@ e he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the lo@@ cker room fresh air , even if the news is in line with the previously thought . &quot;
&quot; Coll@@ y &apos;s teamwork with Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ ok@@ es , will not be used for the One Day@@ t@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem for my part . &quot;
some will not agree , but Co@@ aches and team@@ rider are not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you must remember that as with players their jobs are dependent on the results .
such decisions will not be made easy to heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Angl@@ ed Great Britain from the EU ) could gain access when the economy is up to 2017 in a zone
&quot; David Camer@@ ons un@@ avo@@ ided new negoti@@ ation strategy to hold Britain in the EU , with each day deeper into difficulties , even without the choice of geni@@ alen Jer@@ em@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour and TU@@ C , which runs across Europe on Tuesday because of Europe . &quot;
for@@ eig@@ ners have also their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Nig@@ el Far@@ ages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a European diplom@@ acy and said that some member states , so deeply root@@ ed in various crises , as the EU it is now and not always from their own fault , Great Britain itself and distur@@ bed climate change , which they usually do not want to have . &quot;
&quot; in Bright@@ on , TU@@ C decided on its annual meeting , that it does not like it , when they end@@ anger social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Finance Minister climbing to summit meeting or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , make a photo of themselves front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they are stra@@ ined for reforms . &quot;
it is always about me .
&quot; my European friend , who wish him looking out there in the outside of the EU tent - &apos; l@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ sight@@ ed minister and officials who came up to the point where we don &apos;t care or go . &quot;
&quot; Germany cau@@ dal registered ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is a fo@@ ster@@ hood , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the ministry , as it looks bad for them , as it happens with the ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated cur@@ rants like t@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French François Hollande is proud of his re @-@ election or its replacement in 2017 .
he is also a bl@@ ended force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government in Spain as a left .
&quot; it falls heavily , to imagine that it should be carried out a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British to prevent their energy better for them , Scotland &apos;s dischar@@ ge from the UK to prevent something they don &apos;t want it , because most similar bugs have ref@@ used . &quot;
&quot; therefore , some such ministers may even be inten@@ tional not helpful notes , entirely in the SN@@ P @-@ style , while Britain &apos;s referendum , during Great Britain &apos;s referendum , to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ it process , thought my boy@@ friend . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a pl@@ ast@@ ness &quot; &quot; and &quot; Great Britain has won &apos;t a value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
Europeans know how to be nois@@ eless the fle@@ et street to its costs and what EU sc@@ ep@@ tics were the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press level in 1975 but did not have been inspired by Tony Ben@@ n &apos;t inspired it to our entrance in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; you can remember to Bor@@ is Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ Opport@@ un@@ ists who has a name to be called &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade @-@ ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ s . &quot;
in all his de@@ d@@ eit@@ y Ed Mili@@ band who were his enemies .
&quot; in addition , the med@@ ley of tax @-@ for@@ eig@@ ners , telephone @-@ hack@@ ers for@@ eig@@ ners and the p@@ seudo @-@ In@@ ners , which own most of our big newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bl@@ air thought Tony Bl@@ air is similar to her , but fixed that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a c@@ age , one gets better ban@@ anas to di@@ stract him instead of having lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the mili@@ band was more bl@@ ai@@ ved as a Bl@@ air itself , when he had challeng@@ ed the Camer@@ ons referendum , for the fact that the principle was rejected by French and Dutch sc@@ rub@@ bers in 2005 which opened it with it a post@@ al door . &quot;
the press has never been talking to him .
&quot; but the nice Jer@@ em@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly g@@ aps on the back Monday - I said to him that he didn &apos;t want to spend time more for me - seems to be in danger , N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks Bo@@ y@@ k@@ ott Mur@@ i strategy of 80 @-@ er years to repeat , a mistake at that time and today . &quot;
&quot; it may take , but he must develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC set@@ ers will leave on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns official position to Europe is - I prints it a friendly way - in the development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he says that we should stay in a Protest@@ ant EU . &quot;
&quot; well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional bl@@ ess@@ ile tendency and the wild ge@@ fil@@ ing of Tor@@ y Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can probably say everyone to say yes . &quot;
&quot; it is what was Hil@@ ary &quot; One Ben@@ n , but no B@@ enn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV this week said to ad@@ mit that Cor@@ by@@ ns appointment of the pro@@ vo@@ z@@ eing John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ anz@@ ler has been a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it re@@ minded me of the 70 @-@ he years , when his old father died in TV , thanks to his Labour cable @-@ cabinet , without losing too far and losing his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight in order to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - B@@ enn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , what J@@ C said his compassion , and members at all reports on their post@@ age day on the assembly evening . &quot;
whatever the tou@@ ching Bot@@ t@@ om @-@ Up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants - remember that he even stir@@ red me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all things in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a bro@@ od of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it is right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe that allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the refer@@ en@@ lim@@ agne for a self @-@ comprehen@@ sibility , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks that way .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental social @-@ empl@@ ation to EU membership - in accordance with its number of Bel@@ ager@@ sian Economy , its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion under the left @-@ pres@@ idents , for which the con@@ voy of small sub@@ ordination has been a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with its am@@ big@@ uous activities to Nat@@ o - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C will not start any campaign to dischar@@ ge - will find foreign diplom@@ ats , to try to make a sense of their super@@ vis@@ ors home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin assume political capital - they also have mis@@ leading voters - to make the conc@@ es@@ sions to the British if this can be meaning@@ less ?
&quot; the US is already rather disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , in Libya and Syria , even with a quot@@ ation of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was remin@@ is@@ cent of the start on Monday of something which British influ@@ ence Security Forum was called . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise the report of Public Health England on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; statement of a state funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco , said researchers . &quot;
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) g@@ ills itself g@@ z@@ et by cri@@ tici@@ ze the use of Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in her report about e @-@ cigar@@ ettes used .
&quot; he published the &quot; &quot; basic report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have put the ability to question the ability of data and transferred to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extraordinary wind@@ y basis &quot; , based on the P@@ he his most important conclusion . &quot;
&quot; two more researchers write in BM@@ J and have wonder@@ ed whether the claims &quot; &quot; on stone or sand can build . &quot;
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tro@@ p@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ ewell , Professor of Clinical Immun@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public expects the asser@@ tion of p@@ he that &quot; &quot; the present best estim@@ ation is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes is about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; on a detailed review of app@@ rais@@ al and mod@@ elling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who were conven@@ ed in order to develop a model for multi @-@ multi@@ purpose decision @-@ making ( multi @-@ Criteria Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions about the damage from various nic@@ ot@@ ine @-@ hal@@ ted products to produce . the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ ewell we said that a sponsor for meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose Managing Director previously received by British American Tobacco funds ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
he also wrote the references of BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report .
&quot; one of the 12 participants in the meeting explained , funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but does not have to receive funding from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums are not delivered , but these include several known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes , some of which also includes a branch financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in the tobacco control .
at the meeting the tobacco are attended by P@@ he .
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; conf@@ esses itself &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of hard evidence for the damages of most products in most criteria &quot; , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ ewell . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the P@@ he Report . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ ewell we said that there is no evidence that there is so far no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes has been used as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smoking .
&quot; prof F@@ ent@@ on , Director for Health and Well Being with P@@ he , said that for the tig@@ ations of BM@@ J was already re@@ acted previously . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long car@@ ver dies on his ad@@ diction .
&quot; all evidence shows that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes compared to that is low , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; P@@ he has the clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence demonstrates and what does not , especially when there are so much public confusion over the relative haz@@ ards compared to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 8@@ 0,000 people annually die to a disease with regard to smoking , and smoking costs the national health system two bn in a year . &quot;
&quot; by the clear note of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fr@@ action of harm is caused by smoking , we fulfil our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC should display East@@ En@@ ders , says former Chief of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former chair of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said the BBC should stop programs such as East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would be their right arm &quot; &quot; for hit @-@ shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broad@@ casting can be used only to make the kind of programs which are not sent by other UK stations .
&quot; he cri@@ tici@@ zed the BBC for them that they are public @-@ legal programs which will probably be seen by a smaller public , in hard @-@ contro@@ vers@@ y window against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and transm@@ it@@ ters such as BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC @-@ General Director , Tony Hall , said the company would like to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried six years in channel 4 without success , with the BBC in contact . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs would be commissioned or sends , which also clearly showed by not sub@@ ordin@@ ated Riv@@ eting , &quot; said Johnson of the Ober@@ haus @-@ Communications Committee under his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the radio fee , what I mean , or in the long term not for a good idea , you should not make its production at least on programs that do others do or order . &quot;
they send the Voice in a top @-@ class window as they want to achieve a wide range of support for their future .
&quot; the idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke , it is ri@@ dic@@ ulous , it is obviously non@@ sense . &quot;
Johnson said : &quot; I do not see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax can be financed even without subsi@@ dies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions . &quot;
&quot; frank@@ ly , other channels would give her right arm to it . &quot;
I notice me to see how this is supposed to be public .
I don &apos;t think that this would be the BBC ever at all .
&quot; Johnson , a ent@@ repren@@ eur for series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC to blame for the hunt for reviews is &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to ensure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular ship@@ ments of the BBC give that again what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ My@@ en@@ field lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 was proposed that the BBC shows how East@@ En@@ ders should sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal n@@ ical programs should go out to BB@@ C4 , but they do not fulfill their tasks , and they can ar@@ gue when they created on their seem@@ ing missions to justi@@ fy the justi@@ fication of 4 billion £ broad@@ casting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have seen all these ob@@ sc@@ ented programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
&quot; they place them in a time window , in which no one ever wanted to see them . &quot;
&quot; to the broad@@ casting , Johnson said the Committee : &quot; I urge you to find a more ra@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value here . &quot;
&quot; of course , think of all , we think that you get a great value for 150 £ per year , but for people who is right for the 150 £ a lot of money , wonder if that &apos;s true , because they consu@@ me not much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 Chef David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , said that the BBC has checked their Rei@@ th@@ ian Mission Statement to form and maintain . &quot;
&quot; he said , just little by the BBC @-@ Produktion would now officially distributed as education - he said that there is 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in the radio - and it should take an example in public @-@ legal channels in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; the question of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful of television was shown , and with the commercial transm@@ it@@ ters to make everything available online . &quot;

&quot; the researchers said , the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new process , called Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics , in which ultr@@ aso@@ und can be used to activate a number of bra@@ in@@ - , cardi@@ ac and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the dep@@ ths stimulation , an inv@@ asive procedure , the electrical imp@@ et@@ us in the brain of people used to treat Park@@ in@@ son &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; damages usually do not react on ultr@@ aso@@ und , but Chal@@ as@@ ani exposed to that they did it if they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ copic air bub@@ bles . &quot;

&quot; the reinforced ultr@@ aso@@ und potential affect structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ I@@ on@@ enk@@ an@@ als , and be found in the membran@@ es of some of the wor@@ m cells . &quot;
&quot; the sound @-@ waves effect the opening of these I@@ on@@ cus@@ an@@ cies and activate the cells , which are assigned to them , such a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; to create ultr@@ aso@@ und @-@ controlled Nem@@ ato@@ des , changed Chal@@ as@@ ani genetic the wor@@ ms so that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ s TR@@ P 4 @-@ I@@ on@@ enk@@ an@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; when he applied ultr@@ aso@@ und to the altered Kre@@ aturen , the sound @-@ waves are reinforced by the micro@@ blind and transferred to the wor@@ ms where they shift the modified Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetic , a pione@@ ering tool that allows us to re @-@ turn re @-@ ons with impul@@ se of light and switch . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics have some advantages compared to this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which has to be sent on a optical fiber to the desired place in the brain can happen low cad@@ ence ultr@@ aso@@ und tissues so can be sent to the brain from above on the sk@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to become sus@@ cep@@ tible to human neur@@ ons temporarily for ultr@@ aso@@ und signal in a clinical approach to certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student dor@@ ms
&quot; eleven years ago I moved as a self @-@ for@@ get@@ away in a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smil@@ es , who I desp@@ ised - and on the numerous , long @-@ known complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I learned can be di@@ still@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the move in student dor@@ ms ranges from easily ner@@ ve wr@@ acking up to absolutely fri@@ ght@@ ening .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to cur@@ ate : people tell , where you come if and where you stand Sab@@ bath , and why you do not love nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , it is just a yeast extracts , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - place questions and show you interest .
&quot; it acts the conversation and helps you to find out people find out in contrast to those you would not speak , even if your lashes on fire depos@@ ited and these Fire@@ ers would be . &quot;
let people .
&quot; the rooms of people often turn into beverages account , film @-@ night venues and municipal spots , but they are also places where people move and their under@@ wear . &quot;
referred to : do not remember to start the Un@@ i with a relationship
Intro@@ duc@@ ted will receive a cru@@ de treatment at the University .
&quot; your room should be a Re@@ fu@@ gi@@ um , but many students form a space @-@ to @-@ room @-@ b@@ af@@ mel culture that can lead to friendly and socially and lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be the hell for someone who is trying to relax .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; &quot; I like you , and I want to continue our friendship , but you have to go away so I get the energy back I need to interact with you . &quot;
&quot; try to feel when a sym@@ ph@@ one is exhau@@ sted , and send it an SMS instead to kno@@ ck . &quot;
A@@ pro@@ pos lo@@ ops : do it .
a guy in my student dor@@ ms had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship join by back@@ en .
&quot; since you begin the Un@@ i at the height of the Back Man@@ ie , the monastery is welcome to the doors of men to present themselves with a dish full of Brow@@ nies , less strange to the welcoming of the 1950 @-@ he &apos; welcome in the neighborhood , I have b@@ aked to you . so , and now please ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ously as I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
homemade L@@ eck@@ enstein is a good way to make friend@@ ships .
their room@@ mates are committed to talking and will end up your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a decent bakery . &quot;
&quot; bad cl@@ ump of fl@@ our , sugar and fat lead to that people will be sleep@@ y if you cra@@ w@@ ink . &quot;
food to ste@@ al is a popular crime in student dor@@ ms .
&quot; of course , the cl@@ aws of chick@@ ens is a theft , but is it the behaviour of a drop Mil@@ k for your tea too ? &quot;
review this with the dairy farm .
&quot; the chances are good that they say to serve themselves , even if they cook in the inside . &quot;
&quot; if someone thre@@ w your stuff , that is anno@@ ying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with so balanced than my room@@ mate who added their milk and added , to pun@@ ish Di@@ ebe . &quot;

&quot; Row@@ houses for refugees , all@@ ergy , wal@@ kers &quot;
&quot; the real estate contr@@ actor Markus Gild@@ ner is building in the medium @-@ fr@@ at@@ que ver@@ ental vill@@ i , for people who do not have much money . &quot;
&quot; thus , for refugees - but also as a signal , &quot; not only refugees need not only refugees , but also the only nour@@ ishing mother and the righte@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; I am showing how to make a cheap and well @-@ build in the interview today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot;
thousands of refugees are pus@@ hing for the market .
&quot; entrepreneurs Markus Gild@@ ner believes to know how quickly affordable housing is produced , it builds on a project @-@ detached dwell@@ ings for refugees . &quot;
Mr. Gild@@ ner a lot of refugees will push for the market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gild@@ ner : the mass@@ ac@@ re accommodation in containers or turn@@ als has no sustainability .
for the people remain at a great extent here .
&quot; given the re@@ fuge@@ e flow , we also need plenty of living in the next decades . &quot;
&quot; a very ban@@ di@@ ous , thre@@ eg@@ os@@ sig@@ es town@@ house is the solution . &quot;
Gild@@ enhof : a luxury Row@@ house needs the least place .
it makes integration .
&quot; this is different , if you lod@@ ges the people in apartment blocks . &quot;
&quot; each of the six houses , which are currently constructed in the pilot project , consists of three units for four asylum seek@@ ers each . &quot;
&quot; each apartment unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees will say , it is again peace , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can easily be converted to the corresponding needs .
how much is the cost ?
&quot; seal : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house rises to 184 000 Euro , without property . &quot;
this is man@@ age@@ able .
six months the building took .
this is reasonable .
do the construction requirements have its plans to be complicated ?
Gild@@ ner : civil war I have carried out my project correctly .
it is particularly complicated and always makes it the dro@@ pping D@@ amo@@ kl@@ es@@ ho@@ ist special construction and the location of the location .
* * * * *
&quot; there will still be signed , who creates three apartments in a town@@ house three apartments , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in the cities is missing for them .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the inhabitants respond to their town@@ house project ?
Korrek@@ tur@@ ner : there were what they have thrown to me , luxury built for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
what definitely is wrong .
but do not waste the competit@@ or fight for affordable homes ?
&quot; Sh@@ isha : true is true , yet : we had a construction boom in Germany , but built in luxury apartments that can hardly afford a more . &quot;
my project has the message to also ordinary people &apos;s living room .
&quot; not only refugees , but also the only nour@@ ishing mother or the righte@@ ous . &quot;
I &apos;ll show how to buy still cheap and well .
therefore it is about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS if Apple update will be released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by clicking on the Settings app , on &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; Software update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when it is ready , the telephone gives you the option to download and then install install . &quot;
&quot; some are actually st@@ olen after the installation on issues , since they get a error message that he@@ als the &quot; &quot; Software update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to handle the problem , users are advised , either to wait until the crash or try to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself leads you through the rema@@ inder of the process .
&quot; this may possibly mean the del@@ e@@ tion of apps in order to create space - but Apple has made it easier to do this by creating a special tool , to delete apps and then re @-@ install it once the process is complete . &quot;
it &apos;s worth to ensure that your mobile phone is loaded during the update or is close to a char@@ ger so that the battery is loaded .
&quot; if the charge is too low , Apple is not that the update will continue , since the telephone may be swit@@ ched on half way , and this could lead to an out@@ break of updates . &quot;

&quot; we always had in the back@@ head that the g@@ arb@@ age would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ low@@ ausen and laugh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; when it was , I just inv@@ oked them . &quot;

&quot; this shows how proud and we are glad that the practice will continue , &quot; &quot; st@@ resses Sam@@ t@@ foremost , Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; about 2000 patients are according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll every quarter into practice Fel@@ low@@ ausen , in the northeast practice it is about 500 . &quot;
in As@@ endorf there is still another home office .
a positive @-@ effect of practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ low@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
&quot; if not a successor would have been found , they would have also gone . &quot;
&quot; who visited the dump of consultation , and continues to look especially in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical professional and the cleaning force of the rock . &quot;
&quot; with their departure in As@@ endorf , an era , after all , the medicine is normally practic@@ ed there for 30 years . &quot;

Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot;
&quot; now the border controls goes straight to our south @-@ border , &quot; said Interior , Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls at the Hungarian border always remain er@@ ect .
&quot; still , be sure that everyone who want to make an asylum application , this is also possible . &quot;
the care and safety of the people are in the for@@ eg@@ round .
&quot; clearly , but also , &quot; &quot; that it has significant signals needed , &quot; said the Minist@@ ries . &quot;
people need to know that we do not accept the limit@@ less migration flow - even beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia received &quot; cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia den@@ ied
Croatian Government had previously announced that Slovenia wants to travel to Austria and Germany in the direction of Austria and Germany and may also leave cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees too .
&quot; so , this was like the Interior of Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Stav@@ anger , however . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely in@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia , on the monitoring of the border - primarily to Hungary - intensi@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already much controlled by the border of the Sch@@ engen area . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed , I want to Sloven@@ e its borders to refugees but not ri@@ mm@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; every EU member states must fill his obligations , otherwise the system can not work , &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian Government , the first refugees had already tried in the after@@ math of Tuesday to Tuesday , in Ost@@ Croati@@ ans at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d past to turn off the registration process . &quot;
the Croatian police could gra@@ b them in the near directions .
&quot; according to local media , since then in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik constantly meeting police vehicles with new refugees . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly about the Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
even lif@@ ter &apos;s services and the Red Cross are already in action .
&quot; in the days ahead of his country with approximately 4000 refugees , the Minister of R@@ anko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said . &quot;
&quot; moreover , buses from Pres@@ evo at the Maced@@ onian border , which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border to Croatia , reported Croatian and Ser@@ bian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; however , the government in Belgrade , however , that it may be , the people hit , certain routes : &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; it says it . &quot;
&quot; according to the media report , at least in the morning , a first bus with around 50 refugees had arrived in the Ser@@ b border city Si@@ d , during the course of the day , further buses were expected . &quot;
&quot; about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the in@@ mates were on the road all night out of about 500 kilometres distant border with Serbia .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has made , so the police said that we are going to drive here , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in this way , it could actually already predic@@ t the previous shift from previous Balkan route to Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a little further west @-@ eastern route . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive opportunities for border control &quot;
&quot; Croatia &apos;s Interior of O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic , he had stressed that his country for the event of a strong state of refugees has prepared appropriate plans for possible outcome . &quot;
&quot; however , he does not know , he pointed out that Croatia as non @-@ Sch@@ engen member &quot; has comprehensive opportunities for border control . &quot;
you can qualify the strict controls to qualify for membership in the Sch@@ engen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners since then passed a very good result from what affects the standard of the border controls . &quot;
&quot; on the side of the Hungarian border , the Hungarian border is still stuck to some 300 refugees . &quot;
&quot; according to Belgrade , we had to report the past night at the border crossing H@@ org@@ os , who leads after R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings H@@ org@@ os and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely locked . &quot;
&quot; whether the remaining refugees wish to continue to the Croatian border , is still un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; the Ser@@ bian interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to calm Wedn@@ es@@ early in a locality in H@@ org@@ os : he consider the debates on alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border now is closed , for early retirement . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would not currently act for very high re@@ fuge@@ e goods . &quot;
one could not say whether she would continue her journey over Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers to migrants - dangerous - altern@@ ativ@@ es
&quot; however , private Hungarian schedul@@ es have already begun to spread to the refugees maps on which alternative routes through Croatia are shown . &quot;
&quot; the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous , in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian occasion . &quot;
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of min@@ e@@ waters were sent in the border region .

&quot; only when I make it clear that for me at some point the end of this world , I can live well @-@ being , &quot; says the director of the di@@ ac@@ onic Werk@@ es Mannheim in cooperation with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband der ec@@ umen@@ ical hosp@@ ice . &quot;
therefore this public action was good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; that not everyone wants to be publicly disclosed in the tables , but be understand@@ able , eventually it is a very personal matter . &quot;
&quot; the topic of death and dying may be he@@ aled as before with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , wen@@ s just the Hosp@@ ed@@ ins in recent years have contributed much to it that people will open . &quot;
an assessment that shares Angel@@ ika Go@@ de@@ fro@@ id .
the die and sad@@ ness belongs to the volunte@@ er staff of the first hour .
&quot; by personal experience we face the topic , read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in dying . &quot;
&quot; as the N@@ ec@@ umen@@ ical Hosp@@ et@@ aid received by Call of volunte@@ ers , she immediately reported it and was founded in 1995 when it was founded in 1995 . &quot;
Go@@ de@@ fro@@ id is a team of 45 volunte@@ ers - 43 women and two men - the affected and dep@@ end@@ ents in private households , hospitals and hosp@@ ice and in hosp@@ ice St. Vincent . &quot;
all of them they have been carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ de@@ fro@@ id is able to handle challenges and experiences about the experiences and experiences .
&quot; I see life from another War@@ te , stop it for precious and sh@@ allow for the moment , &quot; says . &quot;
the department of the Amb@@ ul@@ ec@@ umen@@ ical Hosp@@ ed@@ service is free of charge and s@@ ect@@ ing@@ encies .
financial support of the sick@@ ness and donations of relatives and associations allows training as well as training and super@@ visor of dying and sad@@ ness .
training are provided for new employees every two years .
&quot; the charts described on Saturday are now in the house of the evangel@@ ical Church ( M1 , 1a ) and in the House of the Catholic Church ( F2 , 6 ) . &quot;
&quot; there , other personal wishes can be noted on post@@ cards . &quot;
F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , fin@@ ance outlook for 2016 decre@@ ases
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex gives dis@@ appoint@@ ing results for the last quarter , and the Li@@ ef@@ er gig@@ ant talks to a whole year due to the we@@ aker demand for freight service and higher costs in his Bod@@ yp@@ h service . &quot;
&quot; the company also said that she is planning , about 5@@ 5.000 seas@@ onal workers for the holidays . &quot;
&quot; at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to adjust 5@@ 0,000 seas@@ onal workers for the holiday period . &quot;
the share fell on 2.5 percent in the pre @-@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit of 10,@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 in the financial year , which ends in the next May , 20 cent less than with earlier pre@@ diction . &quot;
&quot; analy@@ sts were expected according to a survey of Fact@@ set 10.@@ 84 , according to a survey of Fact@@ set 10.@@ 84 . &quot;
&quot; the lower outlook comes in spite of the discounts , which are average of 4,@@ 9 per cent and are effective on the 4th of January and in spite of higher the co@@ ats for Bod@@ tran@@ sports of heavy and big packages which will be raised in November . &quot;
&quot; however , the company said that the result compared to the previous year due to cost @-@ to @-@ income , higher revenues and because of its growth in online trade will be increased . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company will bring solid income , when considering the we@@ aker than expected economic conditions , above all in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; the plans for the holidays @-@ employment were announced one day later than those of the ri@@ vals of U@@ PS , which plans , 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5.000 additional work@@ force , about the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex 692 million dollars , 6 per cent more than last year . &quot;
&quot; the earnings per share stood at 2,@@ 42 $ per share , just below 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research in analy@@ sts analy@@ sts . &quot;
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $
&quot; six of z@@ ags , analy@@ sts were expecting 12,@@ 23 billion in $ . &quot;
F@@ ed@@ Ex has decre@@ ased to decline in the last few years in the international primary purpose of shipping which he st@@ agn@@ ating sales in its unit express delivery .
but the B@@ oom im Online @-@ Shopping has increased the results with F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; during the last quarter the sales rose by the Bod@@ nik sport by 29 percent , but the operating result was essentially flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the Express Unit recorded higher revenues due to higher rates , while the result of higher labour costs in freight transport . &quot;
&quot; in Pre@@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , decre@@ ases the F@@ ed@@ Ex stocks around 3,@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 per cent , on 15@@ 0.@@ 15 $ . &quot;
on Tuesday closed them with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record high on June 11th .
&quot; on her most anticipated meeting in the year , Federal Reserve Str@@ at@@ essen spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot @-@ Mah@@ ag@@ oni table , to decide whether it is time to start the first time since almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; rather than them at an end of the ench@@ anted , two @-@ stor@@ ey seating area , is situated in the picture of the United States . &quot;
the card is a reminder of that the F@@ ed chair Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues will set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a two popular order from the congress : maxim@@ izing the U.S. employment and prizes given here stable .
&quot; but since the great recession have recognized the F@@ ed guide recognized that there is an un@@ expected mandate , there is financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision whether the US economy is too close to it , whether the US economy is ready to be short@@ ened by the un@@ preced@@ ented rate of incen@@ tive for the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most of the data of the economy show that it is solid , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il advances in global financial markets the already pre@@ domin@@ ate F@@ ed representatives to increase the increase of interest for federal bonds - and be it only to one quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation is first and foremost about what they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Ch@@ ef@@ economical in the Mak@@ ler@@ company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ a &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think when they were looking for a pre@@ text were unable to increase the interest rate , the increased in@@ security around the global market has enough justi@@ fication , continue to wait . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which sec@@ ures by itself the financial market . &quot;
&quot; about half of the econom@@ ists , which were recently inter@@ viewed from Bloom@@ berg , have predic@@ ted this week ago . &quot;
&quot; however , the financial markets awa@@ it a precip@@ itation of the F@@ ed , with a key indic@@ ator that shows only a 30 % chance to increase an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the shr@@ ub@@ les increases the blow by talking that another increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the D@@ ow Jones Industrial Average score at 228@@ ,@@ 89 points or around 1.4 % on 16.@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; this action was trig@@ gered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy considers the set of this week , John Lon@@ ski , Ch@@ ef@@ ö@@ kon@@ om at M@@ oody &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the pro@@ positions at that time , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does it , &quot; having to go far off in their explanation to so@@ jour@@ n financial markets so that they do not get into panic . &quot;
&quot; other experts ar@@ gu@@ ed that a f@@ ad decre@@ ases the financial markets , because they will act uncertainty about when the F@@ ed Act would act . &quot;
&quot; a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in good paths to increase the set of 0.3 percent@@ ages in this month , the first small step in a slow shar@@ pen@@ ing of the mon@@ ary conditions that would test the strength of the recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring , and in the early summer , despite the dis@@ comfort of liber@@ als that would be more economic progress , an increase in the proposition . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs in August slow , the improvement in the labour market was solid . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate decre@@ ased to 5,@@ 1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the levels , which sees the F@@ ed as full employment . &quot;
Pay@@ rolls have shown signs of an recovery .
&quot; and although inflation was constantly broad@@ ened under the y@@ early stage of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason the temporary effects of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can deal higher interest rates and takes them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Shepherd her@@ d@@ son , Ch@@ ef@@ ö@@ kon@@ om by Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot;
&quot; however , the financial markets around the world have gone together at the end of last month after China had been evaluated its currency . &quot;
&quot; D@@ ow Jones Industrial Average fell in May by more than 16 % less than 16 % less than investors , that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would be the global growth th@@ rot@@ tles . &quot;
&quot; this month , the market has a little re@@ covered in this month , whereby the D@@ ow is now around 10 % below the ho@@ ist of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , the market uph@@ e@@ av@@ al influence the complex calculation , when to increase the interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if the events occur on the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks , they would under@@ go to this meeting , Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the U.S. emergency . &quot;
now he says that they will wait at least one month to get the impact better in the handle .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on U.S. economy will be , and there is almost no reliable information that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the global economy is none of the main interests of F@@ ed , therefore , it should not be involved in their decision making . &quot;
but in the end it has become the F@@ ed monetary authority in the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
&quot; the mere note of the then guard Ben S. Bern@@ anke in the year 2013 , that the F@@ ed their mon@@ ary expansion &quot; can be fat@@ al , dis@@ rup@@ tly conf@@ uses around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ connected , can be monitored by the F@@ ed representatives , but also advised to monitor the developments in other place , but also with other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; their decision making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Car@@ abell , Head of global strategy for the asset management of En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ eff@@ rey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , not@@ ion this month that &quot; the F@@ ed a story of re@@ actors on financial market movements are linked with apparently not linked to the economic loc@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; L@@ acker , un@@ authorised member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which is committed to a f@@ list of interest , c@@ ited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower their conduc@@ tivity to 0.3 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limited recogni@@ zing effects on growth in the US , &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot;
a year later the f@@ ed representatives made these cuts .
&quot; the F@@ ed should only put aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the market collaboration in 2008 , Adam S. Poznań , former member of the Committee on the interest of the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the recent tur@@ mo@@ il occur not close to this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which they are afraid of a f@@ ad , because the markets ex@@ ert off , &quot; said Poznań , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think that they should be required at the time . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ shilfe for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany in Germany .
you are welcome to prepare you are not without the commitment of inn@@ umer@@ able volunte@@ ers .
&quot; also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , there is a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city . &quot;
to them belong Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is with body and soul teacher .
also with their 74 lati@@ tude they still teach them still .
every Thursday she is doing it at the asylum seeker on the D@@ ill@@ inger street .
&quot; there she also helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan , the German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , the whole of other classes is considered to be at a proper school . &quot;
Brasili@@ a p@@ ine@@ atric society Rio Grande encourages nutrition for healthy holidays
&quot; the Bra@@ zi@@ lian pedi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS attempts to clear how important good diet during breast@@ feeding is . she does this with the presentation of paintings of babies , who su@@ ck in bre@@ asts , which are painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy foods . &quot;
&quot; mother &apos;s milk consists of a variety of proteins , f@@ ats , vitamins and carbohydrates , babies produce all nutrients they require to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young Mothers , their daily cal@@ orie intake in order to increase approximately 500 cal@@ ories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results reflect that a higher cal@@ orie intake does not im@@ ply the only di@@ cal adjustment to the mot@@ hers . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ esian College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet weak women actually affects the gen@@ es of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can affect the immune system negative . &quot;
exceptions for the new Bern@@ enting Sports Hall
the common Bern@@ ried approved the building rate for the 2.3 million euro expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof is allowed to be flat@@ ter for solar installation .
the plan@@ ations for the long @-@ e@@ enth @-@ se@@ tic@@ ulture at the Bern@@ ender of Sports is set step by step : in the recent community @-@ session was completed by the construction of construction without great discussions .
&quot; previously , the Panel was agreed on among other things nor a request for a &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; release &quot; from the valid development plan . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; exception of the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; we left the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , a &quot; saddle &quot; was to be built with non @-@ mit@@ ory First and Dach@@ stein &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; background of the planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; &quot; this way we get a wonder@@ fully big south@@ eb@@ ach , &quot; explained may@@ or Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in turn , it was again about the umbrella of the roof , which is intended for energetic grounds - different than in the development plan - below ten degrees . &quot;
the volume of the hall is considerably reduced .
&quot; a liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan regarding the roof pitch is no &quot; exceptions &quot; , whereby the amber was more restric@@ tive to the par@@ ish@@ ments for more restric@@ tive orders . &quot;
&quot; however , at the Turn@@ hall@@ mark , it is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; &quot; we do not create preced@@ ence , &quot; thus St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the journ@@ alism at the Sports Centre is a community project in the municipality and SV Bern@@ ried .
around 2.3 million euros have been calculated .
subsi@@ dies are expected from the school and broad @-@ sports promotion .
&quot; in the next procedure , the construction kit for the 18 x 36 meters will now be submitted to large hall now to the Land@@ rat@@ ory . &quot;

refugees need accommodation : study war@@ ns in housing construction
the location on the German market market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for a paid lead .
the pressure on the market grows .
the social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution struggles in the German market have long begun .
&quot; with the coming refugees and labour @-@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pus@@ hing for a market that has already been over@@ loaded in many major cities . &quot;
it compete with income and weak citizens around the most affordable housing .
&quot; to cover demand for affordable housing , would have to be built until 2020 every year 400@@ ,000 new units . &quot;
&quot; on this result , a study comes on behalf of the Commission &quot; &quot; Social housing construction &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for comparison , this year in Germany 26@@ 0,000 units are ready . &quot;
&quot; thus , 14@@ 0.000 apartments are missing . &quot;
&quot; refugees have no longer committed after the first three months of their stay , as an asylum seek@@ ers to live at an initial education entrance . &quot;
&quot; many encounter then to the market market and rows in the long sn@@ akes , in front of the flat @-@ apartments . &quot;
&quot; according to statistics in the last year , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers were staying for rent . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the market does not only be at the increasing number of re@@ fuge@@ e income . &quot;
the study also makes significant om@@ issions in the housing construction of recent years .
&quot; in Germany , a housing @-@ de@@ fic@@ it is about getting bigger from year to year . &quot;
&quot; current missing in the metro@@ politan areas are already around 77@@ 0.000 units , by Matthias Gün@@ ther , author of the study . &quot;
many appe@@ als tend to d@@ welt in large cities in shared apartments .
&quot; young adults stayed due to the built @-@ in on the dor@@ othe@@ tical station , inde@@ fin@@ itely longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the big cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has dec@@ lined once again in recent years . &quot;
to solve the problem propos@@ es the Alliance &quot; Social Be@@ er &quot; housing .
&quot; in doing so , new incentives will boost the social housing . &quot;
&quot; thus , it could be om@@ itted to the Gr@@ une tax and the basic tax for promoted apartments will be susp@@ ended . &quot;
&quot; moreover , according to an alliance , attractive tax @-@ functions are needed . &quot;
the funding program for re@@ fuge@@ e income of the State Bank Kf@@ W comes from towns and churches already well .
&quot; a good week after the start date , with 184 million euros have already been retri@@ eved of some 300 million euros at the end of the evening . &quot;
now the project could even be st@@ olen .
refugees have a free flow from Croatia and Slovenia cor@@ ridor
&quot; after Hungary is practically no more to come , there are getting more refugees away about Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb pres@@ sur@@ es to grant the journey through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
dangerous is the route yet .
Croatia wants to res@@ ign with the neighbouring country Slovenia through the establishment of a cor@@ ridor for refugees .
&quot; I talked to the Sloven@@ ian interior ministers and if it is necessary , we will organize a cor@@ ridor , &quot; said the Croatian National Minister R@@ anko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already one of the Sch@@ engen zone .
the EU @-@ Land Croatia is not yet a Sch@@ engen country .
&quot; after the down@@ fall of the Ser@@ bian border , hundreds of refugees have left to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe . &quot;
&quot; 500 people come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reported the Croatian Television @-@ St@@ amp R@@ TL . &quot;
Hungary was sealed on the morning of the border for refugees .
&quot; new laws that occurred on the same day in force , over@@ thre@@ e@@ eding asylum procedures in Hungary nearly over@@ su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
Croatia wants to leave the refugees .
&quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Z@@ or@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic explained : &quot; &quot; you can go through , and we are preparing for this possibility . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
but they are people who do not want to live in Croatia .
Croatian police gave the first refugees from Ser@@ bi@@ ens to the EU neighbouring Croatia in the morning .
&quot; most of the news reports in Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came with the bus as well as tax@@ en in the Ser@@ bian border town of Si@@ d .
immediately after their arrival they would have tried to go on foot over the green border to Croatia .
&quot; at the Croatian @-@ Ser@@ bian border , the refugees were not across the Croatian border . &quot;
&quot; considering the border of other dangers : there are still sharp min@@ es from the jug@@ s civil war in the 1990s . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Min@@ oan se@@ ater should now set up quickly a secure fit . &quot;
after Hungary the border reached no more refugees after the closing of the border .
on Tuesday the police reported of 366 .
just before the gate on Monday there was still 93@@ 80 .
the new Hungarian laws have to overcome and deteri@@ oration of the bor@@ der@@ ings as a criminal off@@ ence .
therefore 35 Criminal criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern Hungarian border of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the condem@@ ned imprison@@ ment for up to five years and the deport@@ ation from the country .
&quot; according to the indications of the immigration authority one took up on Tuesday in the newly at the border &quot; &quot; Tran@@ sit@@ z@@ ons &quot; &quot; total of 94 A@@ sy@@ lan@@ ders , of which almost all - 93 - the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
among the applic@@ ants : 13 families with young children and two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning we had had 40 refugees from there .
&quot; however , no one has granted a prospect of granted in Hungary A@@ sy@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in recent opinion , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot; &quot;
the ex@@ pi@@ red asylum seek@@ ers should be deport@@ ed there .
in front of the &quot; Tran@@ sit@@ ter &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke there were only a few hundred refugees .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke began to impos@@ e workers with it .
they gathered the g@@ arb@@ age that had left the tens of thousands of people in the last weeks at the road@@ side .
spar@@ ks were dra@@ fted and one of the pr@@ el@@ age in the border town was rebuilt .
at the end of the ren@@ aming nobody wanted to express itself .
a few refugees arrive in Austria after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
&quot; around 20,000 migrants were held to government officials but still in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the trip to Germany . &quot;
the train from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities in the morning .
&quot; within walking , smaller groups of refugees regularly met a regular basis . &quot;
Mayor of &quot; Gest@@ ran@@ ged &quot; about the border
&quot; we were busy after the brid@@ ging on Sunday with the rooms , when suddenly ten people stood with travel off@@ s at the entrance of the tent , &quot; so Whit@@ tier Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted to pass by train to Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; because Germany on Sunday , however , because of the pi@@ vot@@ al current traffic with Austria had anticipated , was designated for them in Wern@@ stein , who immediately offered his assistance and the stu@@ ds together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars on the border into the passage of Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; before , we have left the un@@ hop@@ ed guests at first once , with J@@ ause and drinks . &quot;
&quot; we have said the same , we bring them by car to Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; that was of course for us , &quot; so Stad@@ ler in O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let it to pass a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire resistance .
&quot; that has been very happy , &quot; so Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; the stric@@ ted t@@ pass@@ ages were increased at the Sunday evening in Wels from an ICE in a regional train direction to Pass@@ au , in order to cancel it after the short notice that the railway transport to Germany was adjusted , but still on the fron@@ tier . &quot;
but the Regional Court was placed before the border into Wern@@ stein am Inn .
in Wern@@ stein is the cross @-@ border overall high in the course .
the brid@@ ging group with the Bav@@ arian neighbours around Sunday Ab@@ elli@@ g the day before a branch @-@ brid@@ ge@@ an athle@@ tic - organized by the Union Wern@@ stein and Bayern from Neu@@ kirchen .
&quot; that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has now send further Z@@ ig@@ en@@ nia , is a logical result of a seem@@ ing policy : &quot;
&quot; instead of help in the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke now , in the establishment of structures to help humanity , our Chancellor is highly official and publicly announced the attitude of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ ir@@ cle of National Soci@@ alism . &quot;
suffering from these policies are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now facing in the border areas with cha@@ otic states .
&quot; also the containers will find that the &quot; &quot; gel@@ ed Land &quot; , &quot; which she invited and welcome you , nothing but another re@@ fuge@@ e camp . &quot;
&quot; it will become a major challenge , in view of the continuing re@@ fuge@@ e currents and the end of winter , with us human @-@ worthy conditions for protective cloth@@ s . &quot;
&quot; and there will be another bigger - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
Kon@@ rad in search of 35.@@ 000 winter@@ ing quart@@ z
Kon@@ rad has fully to do all hands with the re@@ fuge@@ e production .
Christian Kon@@ rad is it normal that his word has weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Bank Bank@@ er to dis@@ continue our lod@@ g@@ ings for the mill@@ ennium .
the chaos in the first @-@ dining centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already been a grip on a grip .
&quot; we have no hom@@ eless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot;
&quot; the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who arrived on Monday to Austria was without a great swi@@ vel , said Kon@@ rad and pra@@ ised the organisational &quot; master@@ pieces . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said of a &quot; &quot; k@@ ris@@ ky situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; altogether counts Kon@@ rad , with a need of 8@@ 5.000 Quar@@ ry in the he@@ ed year . &quot;
&quot; to fulfill the number , must be found in the next weeks even 35.@@ 000 accommodations - 20,000 to provide countries , 15 000 of the Bund . &quot;
&quot; should there be more refugees , we can make it . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a barrel without floor , &quot; said Kon@@ rad . &quot;
he has already had talks with the provin@@ cial service .
they would have been convinced to him as well as for the next refugees .
&quot; in Ober@@ österreich it works well , &quot; Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Kon@@ rad .
&quot; tomorrow , there will be a meeting with Card@@ inal Christoph beau@@ born , which shall be clari@@ fied as the Church will help . &quot;
&quot; great expectations focuses on the asylum @-@ ordin@@ ator also into the OR@@ F action &quot; hel@@ mets , as we . &quot;
&quot; on the platform , we can provide personal people un@@ complicated accommodation . &quot;
&quot; moreover , one hopes to do hotels , which will be empty during the winter time . &quot;
Kon@@ rad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards of accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
&quot; in emergency , it cannot be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ors must have a certain amount of tow@@ el @-@ rail or size of the sho@@ ots . &quot;
for a short time would have to apply &quot; Not@@ ice &quot; standards .
&quot; that he is more successful in contrast on the German Federal Ministry of making of successful , established Kon@@ rad with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an older Lord , whom one does not say without further into the face . &quot;
bel@@ iefs is its most important weapon .
&quot; Kon@@ rad and Ma@@ ier do not cause any costs , as they themselves expl@@ ored . &quot;
their employees want to increase it on three to four .
his own lod@@ g@@ ings had been not yet successful .
Kon@@ rad wanted to put a container at the Step@@ han@@ splatz in the office .
but there are apparently problems with the permit .
Linz calls for a better distribution
&quot; first , no opening of urban sport@@ mil@@ ds and other buildings like Tips @-@ Arena and design Center for the accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is currently not necessary , as you can currently bring people currently without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lug@@ er ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; however , more locations are to be tested for emergency purposes . &quot;
criticism of the solidarity on the division of refugees within the federal state .
other areas also have to make their contribution here .
&quot; Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in a longer phone at the Bav@@ arian Prime Minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ( C@@ SU ) has the Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday the further approach in the re@@ fuge@@ e survey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer has in@@ sured me that the German borders are not sealed . &quot;
the res@@ titu@@ tion of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany are still possible .
&quot; however , there are now the appropriate border controls . &quot;
the special benefits of refugees to Germany will not be there any more .
&quot; however , the protective investigations would be brought to Germany with regular gul@@ ps . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; by the other EU member states called for more reinforced solidarity in the re@@ fuge@@ e question . &quot;
&quot; that now Austria has now returned to its limits to its borders , is for P@@ adh@@ inger &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; from the approach of the Germans . &quot;
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a question of time
the General @-@ Con@@ fes@@ sion of the &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; in the Lin@@ er Industry line is officially completed .
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and of production buildings is the listed IT @-@ Group S &amp; T , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meter ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology area . &quot;
&quot; in the IT , the clever list@@ ers are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T @-@ Chef Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
he can imagine to invest in start @-@ up firms of the New Wer@@ ft and later also what to ac@@ qui@@ rate .
&quot; from the beginning , S &amp; T he wants to cooperate with the new neighb@@ ors - from a lot of defe@@ ats , the next R@@ unt@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; 1.9 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the location ; 3,@@ 3 million euros by the Tech@@ center , which one third of the city of Linz , the land of Upper Austria and the covenant ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is adjustable from Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of resi@@ dual space in the building are rented out , for another 40 percent are given requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni In@@ hab@@ it opened second shop in the arc@@ ade
in the new shop Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are at the centre of attention .
actually J@@ utta Brei@@ t wanted to settle a dog .
&quot; this project had to commen@@ ce the 49 @-@ year inc@@ ub@@ ress of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade , finally , she has now gotten back in the form of another business . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la @-@ shop opposite the business , in which it is sold among other , cases , suit@@ cases , shoes and fabrics of various manufacturers , now turns all about the hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , Wall@@ ets are available from 75 Euro . &quot;
larger pockets and accessories cost of up to 500 euros .
since yesterday the New Shop is in operation .
&quot; previously , several weeks has been rebuilt . &quot;
&quot; but I long over@@ laid it for a long time , if I am still looking for a store , &quot; says Brei@@ t . &quot;
&quot; decisive for the decision was among other things , that also the Fur@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna from the idea of a special location , to which only their hand@@ bags are sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the one in the Greater Linz , which sell this brand , says the mother of two daughters who has even Italian roots . &quot;
you are interested in the c@@ radle of her mother in the c@@ radle .
&quot; to me most , if something develops and I can show new trends at the prices . &quot;
&quot; why such a woman with the sight of a beautiful hand bag , can also answer the wife not with last certainty . &quot;
perhaps it is that a beautiful bag is upgra@@ ded to each out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
&quot; the Pf@@ äl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose resident can be called . &quot;
this property combines some also with the billi@@ on@@ aire , the U.S. president wants . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for isolation .
&quot; whether it is manifest@@ ed out of an alien , journalists and refer@@ ees in the international crisis policy reveals the applic@@ ants for the US presidential system . &quot;
and well cuts well .
&quot; this is also registered in the pf@@ ael@@ ic K@@ all@@ town , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate has origin@@ ated . &quot;
the New York with her sound@@ proof@@ ing is many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf next to the wine @-@ street .
man@@ cher in the 1200 @-@ resident @-@ place is over @-@ zig corners with it related .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palatinate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in the elect@@ oral mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del turned a film about Tru@@ mp .
&quot; and what do the vill@@ agers about his goal , to become the most powerful man in the world ? &quot;
&quot; I think they find that somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed by her k@@ all@@ stad@@ ters form , &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot;
the native Cape Town has a am@@ using documentary movie about the place and its famous Spr@@ inkl@@ ers that is next to Tru@@ mp and the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
&quot; Tru@@ mp , who is not known for compl@@ ain@@ eness , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt ( 2014 ) also too word - so with the statement that he would certainly also be successful when he would live in K@@ all@@ town . &quot;
in the heart of the hearts he did not put it there .
&quot; although there are respect for the performance of the family , but also ten@@ den@@ ial the opinion that Tru@@ mp is a bit of a mouth @-@ mouth , says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; random the nickname , the K@@ all@@ town in the radius , &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher &quot; &quot; - to flo@@ od : the in@@ eness , says it . &quot;
Tru@@ mp comes from the village of in@@ am@@ orta .
&quot; the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began 18@@ 85 , when the later grandfather was hi@@ ked and opened in the US a Lok@@ al for Gold@@ gr@@ ä@@ ber . &quot;
ground@@ ing of real estate : were the first plot of land in New York .
&quot; but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of trag@@ ic : your desire to return to a long time into homeland , to divide the bay@@ ern state at that time . &quot;
&quot; he did not have Tru@@ mp , because he once said without permission to ch@@ ew@@ ed , the director of the institute for pf@@ alz history and folk tag , Roland Paul , was explained to the film start . &quot;
Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal immig@@ rant . &quot;
this is in contrast to the mit@@ ory statements of the descendants .
he had repeatedly talked to the Mexican immig@@ rants in the US and called for the construction of a bound@@ ary wall to prevent illegal immig@@ rants .
&quot; just as the pol@@ ish , this is not so sympath@@ etic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant red Tru@@ mp ( &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a @-@ born Tru@@ mp , the Grand@@ pa was born @-@ born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
the win@@ em@@ akers in retirement sees the Americans more dis@@ soci@@ ably ; he is always so anno@@ ying . &quot;
believes that Tru@@ mp comes from ?
&quot; I cannot imagine , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never car@@ es about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the Pen@@ sion@@ ins Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ramm is mentioned as man@@ cher K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz when visiting something for the organ was sp@@ ended what is generally good on .
&quot; that can I introduce myself from the Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; they are better if he does not give the choice , for &quot; he has such radi@@ cal views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; when those who had at the time of his grandfather in the United States too , would have been like he , &quot; he would never had arrived at all . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ er@@ to@@ eder Sarah B@@ üh@@ ler . &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; my president is not so , &quot; says . &quot;
and : &quot; the grapes are also ri@@ pe without the President of Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; Wend@@ els film , seen for Tru@@ mp long inter@@ viewed , have seen 12 000 Kin@@ og@@ gers , even in the United States awak@@ ens the interest . &quot;

&quot; today , a slight increase compared to the rating for Monday ( 3@@ 17.@@ 000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3.000 ) , but his number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,@@ 000 ) . &quot;
today Today has closed the gap to Sun@@ rise in recent months .
&quot; in August Today was on average 3@@ 18.@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ 0.000 of Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year the distance between 4@@ 0,000 and 5@@ 0.000 . &quot;
&quot; so far in September Sun@@ rise is at an average of 34@@ 9.@@ 000 spect@@ ators to 314.@@ ,000 while today . &quot;
this is the most interesting what happens every morning .
the win@@ der of the wall concern this morning more than the Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are decent , thanks for the review ! &quot;

the Great New@@ ness for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial port of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama of a recent we@@ ath@@ ered father , who dis@@ ab@@ ide with his two children on the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million spect@@ ators . &quot;
cri@@ tics asked to be asked whether Thom@@ son a hit show Solo without the rafting Star Rebecca Gi@@ b@@ ney .
the result of yesterday evening rep@@ lied with a clear &apos; yes .
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million spect@@ ators , and proposed slightly The Block ( 83@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL family ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two by The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5.@@ 30 p.m. ) of the new qui@@ z show , hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ K@@ ee@@ fe was issued on average 44@@ ,000 spect@@ ators . &quot;
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 p.m. to 18 : 00 ) sp@@ rang on 6@@ 23.@@ 000 spect@@ ators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13.@@ 000 ) .
&quot; on the assembly evening , the first half hour was achieved by The Ch@@ ase Australia 5@@ 20,000 spect@@ ators and in the 2nd half hour of € 7@@ 20,000 . &quot;
&quot; Hot @-@ Se@@ at on average 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
the decrease in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia is confident that Hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prev@@ ail at 5 : 30 pm .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute that did not generate the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Show .

&quot; the last three agree with a Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man , but whom he will choose ? &quot;
secret ? ...
Lana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may possibly be ignor@@ ant who wins The Bachelor &apos;s Bachelor . &quot;
&quot; the woman , at the Sam Wood in The bach@@ elor &apos;s finally , was v@@ eil@@ ed in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not be inexpensive to whether they are the one that has received the last rose .
&quot; but as we have Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before made up of three two , but did not acci@@ dent@@ ally put an indication of who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood continues its lips up to the fin@@ als on Thursday sealed
&quot; all three women have left themselves in Ly@@ ric way that Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of hum@@ our , ambi@@ tion , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should be W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; , &quot; you could be their answers to the game ver@@ b who won the heart of the Bachelor &apos;s heart . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ on @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki said both fast - except itself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner in Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood from the first day had a simple relationship with one another .
&quot; from the moment when I went into the house and ( Sar@@ ah ) and Sam@@ s , I noticed that they were quite compatible and I have imag@@ ined the whole course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah comes with both feet on Earth , it makes so much fun to be together with her &quot; , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
you feel comfortable and comfortable together .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood as a couple is well suited .
&quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house @-@ visit last week had made it clear that wood &quot; the One . &quot; &quot;
&quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , I was clear that this is obviously not just a game - I am now subject to it : &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when they were asked , who Wood choose to pick , if not she , there she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girl alike - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lana .
&quot; the Bachelor is broad@@ cast@@ ed on Wednesday , 19 : 30@@ pm . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had multiple options to start his NF@@ L career .
Det@@ roit and Seattle were great interest after moving into the US - and there were many other teams that sent back after his impressive open training day closing last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a clever decision .
&quot; some trainers have done Hay@@ ward for the rest of the game to bank account , as he lost a Ger@@ angel , as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Rugby On@@ es during his first push @-@ return on Tuesday at the 20th @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota . &quot;
&quot; however , Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his man and gave Hay@@ ne@@ on the next opportunity for a pl@@ unt return and also into the current play after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush . &quot;
Tom@@ ves@@ ula did not see its true face in the lo@@ cker after the game .
&quot; instead of his R@@ ook@@ ies , in front of the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ m@@ ula has also strengthened his public in his press conference after the game .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Sport@@ sit@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by the Speci@@ alt@@ e@@ ams @-@ Co@@ ordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who sent him to forget his trial , and to take care of the next game . &quot;
&quot; Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t was restored with a P@@ unt , which was restored in the first quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ enti@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian pl@@ ague for his NF@@ L Debut had to hope . &quot;
Hay@@ ne moved according to the F@@ um@@ ble gle@@ aming the playing field and later the austr@@ alian radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine any worse start into his NF@@ L career .
&quot; that was a thing that comes now , one only takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
Hay@@ ward avo@@ ided the car@@ vers with his Orig@@ in debut at that time in 2007 when a pass in his own in @-@ Goal area led to a Tr@@ y for Queens@@ land .
&quot; in total , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;

Google launches dup@@ lic@@ ing donations to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
&quot; Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign , bringing 11 million dollars for humanitarian organisations that have ex@@ pi@@ red by the European nations , since they fle@@ e from the war and fle@@ e countries . &quot;
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach at the announcement of donations &apos;s call on his blog .
&quot; instead of making a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee working with her family from Kab@@ ul than she was seven years old , about their personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; to our trip he belong@@ ed many dark train and buses , as hunger , thir@@ st , cold and fear , &quot; wrote them . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the fuge@@ e and migrants crisis grew up in Europe , are looking for many people like my family des@@ perate for help . &quot;
&quot; donations are given to four non @-@ profit organizations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees . &quot;
&quot; Google said that the first global entire donations collected , up to a value of 5.5 million on g@@ oogle.com / re@@ vit@@ re@@ juven@@ ated to 11 million $ dou@@ bled . &quot;

for slightly over@@ weight di@@ abe@@ tics can be helpful and can be helpful .
the advantages of weight treatments for slightly over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
&quot; it is still too early to say whether it is slightly over@@ weight people with diabetes after the weight training surgery longer than those that do not get @-@ surgical treatments . &quot;
&quot; the dying data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , which wrote a editorial lead to the new study in j@@ ama Surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss or o@@ besity surgery , use various methods to enlarge the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the bo@@ its ability to absor@@ b food .
&quot; over the years Adi@@ posit@@ as was done in the treatment of type 2 diabetes as an efficient , but most studies were carried out in people who are fam@@ ine with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain level of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24,@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is over@@ weight , and people with a BM@@ I more than 30 are considered worth@@ less . &quot;
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.org / 1@@ D0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital Data , which they have collected since 2007 in a study and compare two types of o@@ besity and stomach fir@@ ing - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily over@@ weight . &quot;
&quot; the average BM@@ I under which the operation under@@ goes , s@@ ank from 31 to 24@@ ,5 up to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the BM@@ I stayed with those who did not @-@ surgical diabetes treatments were about equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; under the those , which under@@ went on a surgical procedure which decre@@ ased from 36 % the diabetes illness completely and 28 % partly . &quot;
in the medical @-@ treated group proceeds in comparison with diabetes completely only at one percentage and partly with only about two percent .
&quot; in addition , the results were carried out in the controls of blood pressure , the Tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L Ch@@ olester@@ ols &quot; generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group &quot; , &quot; found the authors . &quot;
the researchers also war@@ ned the patient @-@ blood mirror of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ab@@ 1@@ c which reflects the blood sugar over time .
Hä@@ modul@@ am A@@ 1@@ c is best held under 7 percent and write the resear@@ cher .
after surgery the average hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level of about 9 percent at about 6 percent .
&quot; however , it remained stable at about 8 percent in the medical treatment group . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ emic control &quot; - as you reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level - reduced , not the mort@@ ality in five years , so the conduc@@ tive resear@@ cher Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
research @-@ team also has average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the B@@ yp@@ ass group had lost more weight ( 18,@@ 7 v@@ s. 14,@@ 2 kg ) , has reached major reverse in BM@@ I ( 7.4 % v@@ s. 2.8 % ) and recorded quite a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % v@@ s. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show an survival part of the surgery five years , there is indications from a study of heavy people in Sweden making an operation to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish trial it was with fat @-@ b@@ aked people who have under@@ gone up an o@@ besity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that conventional methods tried . &quot;
&quot; although the new study did not prove an advantage for survival in the surgery , Black@@ stone said Black@@ stone , it be so@@ othing for people with a BM@@ I below 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; that is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , without increased risk of death or kid@@ ney disease , she said . &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors were starting to take weight seriously , as soon as the patient with its BM@@ I between 27 and 30 is up to 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think that we are too long waiting until we take people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
I think that once they have accum@@ ulated this genetic modifications that have firm their body with o@@ besity and diabetes is a revers@@ al really hard .

&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot enter all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to re@@ fuge@@ e crisis in the Middle East . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddh@@ ist leader invited to end the violence in the home country of refugees .
&quot; the Dalai Lama spoke the problem of the sake of re@@ fuge@@ e crisis at the beginning of his ten day visits in his speech at the beginning of his ten day visits to the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford , which is dedicated to eth@@ ics studies . &quot;
&quot; he called for the interests of humanity , prior to the interests of individual nations or even inter @-@ continents . &quot;
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of the western European countries is ad@@ mir@@ able , but the situation is not ade@@ qu@@ ately . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama and Austrian efforts in addressing the crisis pra@@ ised , he stressed that there is only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees , is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions like a true peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries . &quot;
finally we must think about how the kill@@ ings in their countries will be reduced .
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the application of violence has never solved these problems , he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama spoke the problem of violence and commented also George Bush &apos;s actions after the terror@@ ist attack of 11 September and presented the violent response in the US a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events after himself .
&quot; after September 11 I pushed my sympathy in a letter to President Bush , and I said to him , the way to solve this problem lies in non @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his moti@@ ves were good , but he put authority ; and this has un@@ expected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of intake of hang@@ ing dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the past 4 years
&quot; po@@ ison@@ ed centers in the United States report about an almost 400 process improvement in the number of children under twelve years , the sever@@ ely alco@@ ho@@ lic hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , so the Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. G@@ ay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenues of handicraft manufacturing in children under 12 years , the po@@ ison@@ al centres have been reported from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are increasingly common to these products , and sad@@ ly a percentage of them go in not@@ ation , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants can drink , while some do they do to impress your friends or because of a nut of social media . &quot;
show videos to YouTube how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants can drink only because of an cheap adventure .
young people are alleg@@ ed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with soft alco@@ ho@@ lic dial@@ ect mixed to get a harder bever@@ age .
younger children can be shock@@ ed by attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
a child does not think that this is bad for it &apos; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the most attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are par@@ fum@@ ated .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant with stra@@ w@@ or , grapes and Oran@@ ge@@ du@@ ft , which are very pleas@@ ing for children . &quot;
hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
particularly with young children can already lead a few sy@@ ringe about the alcohol po@@ is@@ oning .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , Medical Director of Gi@@ ft@@ not@@ aler in the Hospital of the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Sender Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you would have no conclusion whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in reach of children , and when children come from it , then it is a quick way to consumed a lot of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ year girl , which had recently taken four spr@@ ink@@ ers from the Stra@@ w@@ berry sc@@ iss@@ ors in school , was taken into a not@@ ion of treatment . &quot;
&quot; your blood cells was 179 , twice higher than the thres@@ hold that applies to an adult as dr@@ unk , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a emergency medical doctor who treated them at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlan@@ ta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah slept her words and was not able to go than they arrived in the emergency .
doctors un@@ guard@@ ed it overnight in a separate kinder@@ garten on signs of Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma because the girl had fallen by the alcohol and had the head st@@ olen , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said . &quot;
&quot; this was very fri@@ ght@@ ening , &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs Mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fat@@ al for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers recommended to use alco@@ ho@@ lic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
about alcohol po@@ is@@ oning in addition were some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants associated with death@@ s .
&quot; in 2013 , two women sc@@ ars in Ont@@ ario women after the closing of ham@@ mo@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , which is a tox@@ ic , not relief . &quot;
&quot; employees of health authorities keep that the product contained meth@@ anol contained , a dead@@ ly solution , rather than eth@@ anol . &quot;
&quot; in January we planned three students of the fourth class in the state of New York , their &quot; Mix@@ ed &quot; teacher trained in order to form anti @-@ bacter@@ ial products in order to form anti @-@ bacter@@ ial products . &quot;

&quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an amb@@ assador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of Cel@@ tic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here talk not only about the return of the leader@@ ers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams together and that is what they are interested .
&quot; there are a lot of tension in the Old Fir@@ m games , and there are not only the people in Scotland that want to see these games . &quot;
I will turn the things down .

&quot; I know , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very angry or sad over what happened . &quot;

&quot; we really need , really the support of Cel@@ tic because that makes the player better . &quot;

&quot; Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es is convinced that his team had to fight against Hamilton Ac@@ ties to see a seventh consecutive League victory , which gave them a lead of five points before Cel@@ tic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ on@@ ey disc@@ meter in the first half time . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; there is no team who has won all in poker play , or le@@ agues , the games of this kind also has not been won . &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged since it rises in the United Kingdom .
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged during the period from May to July , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom , as a whole , at least 10.000 to 1.9 million in the same period . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate was about 9 percent on the UK@@ s of 5.5 percent as figures of the office for National Statis@@ tics ( ons ) .
&quot; in the interim period the employment was launched in Scotland at 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of workers now at 2.@@ 6@@ 12.@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; the employment rate for Scotland fell in the course of the quarter to 7@@ 4,@@ 0 percent - a number over the UK average of 7@@ 3,5 percent . &quot;
&quot; the Perman@@ ent Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ually commented the latest figures and said , &quot; &quot; the long term plan of the government has laid the foundation for stronger economies . &quot;
it &apos;s almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has taken the historical decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; in these 12 months , we have seen further improvements on the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decrease in unemployment . &quot;

why I will be a witness of an Ex@@ ec@@ ution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; a bit later today , except in a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is put to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens , and I hope that it is not happening , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the To@@ ge@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , if Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p will be over@@ cast by the po@@ ison . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death .
&quot; the invitation has already been made in January with his best friend , and although I was shock@@ ed , I had agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day closer , I began to fear . &quot;
&quot; so , why should I do it ? &quot;
&quot; I voted , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists must be seen in the USA and there are often more applications available than places available , find a mak@@ dr@@ ere lot@@ tery instead to decide who is elected . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media channels from 12 to five .
who is selected to watch it emot@@ ionally .
I cannot do that .
&quot; in addition to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps , I will sit with my own relationship over the months with teleph@@ ones and a two @-@ half hours a visit . &quot;
I like guy .
we lau@@ gh a lot of times when we speak .
&quot; the j@@ ail authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journ@@ alist , so it will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pin to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journ@@ alist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma acc@@ used to give me on Twitter , my im@@ parti@@ ality . &quot;
here is the lesson .
&quot; tell the story of your favorite , as he wants it , and you will get access . &quot;
I set me with her .
&quot; it pointed out that it would have been better form@@ ulate , but they still thinks that it is false , what I do . &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I had said and wrote .
&quot; he does not tell me what I have to write ; and I would not do it , even if he would do it . &quot;
I said to him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
&quot; but , he wants that an international repor@@ ter is present to write there . &quot;
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that the publicity work of the movement against the death penalty was pun@@ ished . &quot;
Kim Bell@@ ware , a Re@@ union of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will be sitting next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of po@@ dc@@ asts I have done . &quot;
I do not want to go back to all details here .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is inno@@ cent .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would guil@@ ty him to be a benefici@@ ary of the act .
but I believe that a strong lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood is that he is not of the morning .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justi@@ fy a death sentence .
I believe that its execution is wrong .
and from that perspective I will see him dying .
I can not claim to be truly objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters that you can apply for it .
&quot; what you will get from me , what it means to see a man an un@@ necessary death to die . &quot;
man according to the Hum@@ idi@@ fier police are re@@ covered from the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman was dry when he spoke the man from the C@@ anning River .
&quot; an attempt of a man of Per@@ th to hang out the police , was un@@ successful when he was in the sei@@ zed and he@@ aled water was , just a few meters away from a police officers , that tried to return to a g@@ ently to go to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called on Tuesday to a home @-@ crisis break@@ down in Beck@@ enh@@ am .
&quot; when they discovered the susp@@ ects , this to escape them towards C@@ anning River . &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I am not going out , kom@@ m and hol me , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Sh@@ and@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ stable Sal@@ ma Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too excited about doing his unique shape , therefore he turned out a reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; &quot; A good polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people funny things to try to escape , &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
master@@ master @-@ football Ben C@@ ous@@ in provides an unforgettable example .
&quot; in 2006 C@@ ous@@ ins continued his car to the dit@@ ch to go to alcohol control , and tried to swim over the Swan River . &quot;

Peter M@@ oody claims that stew@@ ards search@@ ed him to c@@ ate it and threat@@ ens the racing sports .
&quot; Peter M@@ oody claims that the stew@@ ards of Racing Victoria have tried , last year a sp@@ ion to install and dro@@ ught the race immediately . &quot;
&quot; he pointed to the stew@@ ards and the integration department of Racing Victoria and maintained that they had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Sc@@ rat@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a racing day treatment , the last stra@@ w on Wednesday , led through . &quot;
&quot; M@@ oody said the Fair@@ fax media , that he always tries to do what is best for racing sports and he found themselves under difficult conditions , when it comes to the positive co@@ b@@ old rab@@ bit of Li@@ dar@@ s who cannot explain . &quot;
he did not hold back 18 months because of the esp@@ ion@@ age pre@@ matur@@ ely and did not want it to see that it would like to be a highly ques@@ tioning of grapes .
&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have long been eating for a long time , but sometimes you are so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything at once comes out , &quot; said M@@ oody . &quot;
they know that it went on .
&quot; sometimes one re@@ acts , and one has to live with the consequences , and I have to live with that which I have said . &quot;
I will go home today and sleep well .
&quot; I would like to go from the root , and I want my owners think that my best is trying for her . &quot;
&quot; when they begin to think , I do not , then I should not be more trainers . &quot;
then I have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; previously , M@@ oody had taken the bom@@ b in an interview with rac@@ ing.com working that the integration of the Integration Department had tried to c@@ ater his stand . &quot;
&quot; prior to the eight@@ een months sa@@ ßen Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stew@@ art in a room with a man - I &apos;m pra@@ ying when I &apos;m asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables , to deliver information on what I said within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oody to rac@@ ing.com &quot;
they obviously believe that I am a che@@ er .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly believe in their nos@@ es , because they try to gr@@ asp it , failed . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the RV@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ den , official president of the RV@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ und@@ ry , contemporary CEO of RV@@ L , were aware of this at the moment and are still today . &quot;
should I bring that to the view that it is personally ?
&quot; has the RV@@ L beh@@ av@@ ed , and maybe people outside of trainers are responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ? &quot;
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
perhaps the people out there that I am .
&quot; maybe they must take my license and rep@@ el me , and I have no doubt that what I say , they now think about it . &quot;
but I have arrived at the point where no matter is and that makes me sad .
this really makes me sad .
I will put pressure on them and pus@@ hing her to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the fruit levels of the trainer will have built up with the long @-@ wing Kob@@ old examination of Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Sc@@ rat@@ ching did that he said that he could throw his license over the table . &quot;
&quot; M@@ oody , best known by its preparation of the un@@ written master Black Caviar , recorded the racing @-@ treatment rule , after a pack of mud or tone on the horses has been carried out , what was called against the rules . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot;
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has mist@@ ak@@ enly called on the leg .
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it could have been the whole day that was that way .
but it also had so on the racing day .
M@@ oody could be confront@@ ed with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack at the racing day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
&quot; people who set these rules , know nothing about the horse . &quot;
&quot; we all see that we need rules but here you went too far , &quot; said M@@ oody . &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ am@@ y propos@@ es against ri@@ vals for claim to ring fight
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ am@@ y has critic@@ ised criticism on the backl@@ ash of his players as &quot; agenda Setting &quot; from two prime ministers to the NR@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robin@@ son said that the refer@@ ee of the Storm players &quot; Ring@@ wil &quot; has allowed to compete with his team during the high Storm fin@@ s in Sydney on Fri@@ day@@ light .
Bris@@ bane G@@ enn@@ ett B@@ enn@@ ett made a little conf@@ used note on the Storm Team after his crew had sc@@ ored the Final victory against North Queens@@ land C@@ ow@@ boys on Satur@@ day@@ time . he called the game a &quot; sample score &quot; of the Rugby League and said that the two from Queens@@ land do not too good &quot; in the R@@ ingen .
Bell@@ am@@ y def@@ ended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his crew and said that they were concent@@ rating only on their &quot; Contact . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ am@@ y added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team will allow him to be confident , since it was worried that they were worried about the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; this always appears to - I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robin@@ son said about Ring@@ wil , when she took us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ am@@ y on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we have changed anything about our defen@@ sive system or techniques in the whole year . but during the last six weeks we have made our contact with links to a real focus , and this did it for us . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ento has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to exercise . it is therefore most likely to get used to lose , so it was a bit of shock for him . &quot;
it is quite funny , as this is always coming up again at this time of year . &quot;
Bell@@ am@@ y has attacked B@@ enn@@ ett idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and remember that B@@ enn@@ etts St George Ill@@ awar@@ ra won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he compared his game on Satur@@ days evening with our first day evening and how exciting her play was , &quot; said Bell@@ am@@ y . &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was cri@@ tici@@ zed in the year 2010 St George as a boring team and Way@@ ne said that he will take care of a di@@ vorce .
&quot; but now he has a team , that can play and that we look as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
&quot; this is the ball game that you want to play , if you have these kinds of players . &quot;
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so that they can play as this . &quot;
&quot; I build stronger trust , because they say these things , because they are a bit worried about having to play against us . &quot;
six weeks ago they did not think of us when the big Games went .
Bell@@ am@@ y also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters a higher result achieved than the game bron@@ cos against cr@@ ow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I have not yet seen it , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts at our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
or are Paul and do not make points something exciting ?
for me it is the schedul@@ es .
&quot; when they mention , it means that we will meet in a phase yet . &quot;
&quot; the Storm Team has free to receive this weekend since they have won the right , either North Queens@@ land C@@ ow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Satur@@ days evening in the morning at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . the ticket sales begins from the next day tomorrow . &quot;
Ser@@ bi@@ er with 200@@ .000 $ deposit for drug candidates
&quot; a man who possibly caused a life @-@ long sentence , because of his desire to come into possession of 40 kil@@ ograms co@@ ca@@ h caused by Queens@@ land , was released upon a deposit of 200,000 $ . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested in the last month after the Bundes@@ police 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay took place in South America through V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and entered in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed if he met his fellow @-@ stor@@ y@@ les during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Ro@@ adh@@ ouse where the police found 40 kil@@ ograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
&quot; despite having a possibly li@@ fel@@ ong pun@@ ishment for the attempt to possess a commercial amount of Kok@@ ain , ar@@ gu@@ ed the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the entire amount and that in the coffee could have been of a harm@@ less reason . &quot;
&quot; the judge of the Supre@@ me Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was worried about the stron@@ gh@@ old in Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot;
in the criminal law he bel@@ low the police about his place of residence .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic@@ s mother and step@@ father had a guarantee of 200,000 dollars as security together to achieve its release .
&quot; after reading the ei@@ pper declar@@ ations of the two persons it is clear that the circulation of security of 200,000 dollars a real financial burden , &quot; said judge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not suff@@ ice to keep him away , not to seem , war@@ ned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against deposit , under the conditions that he announces his Australian and his ser@@ p@@ hic pass , alongside the police every day , and turn to a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;

he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and he asked to send more photos .
he said that he did it to rock them .

&quot; cars from the compact class are currently in demand high : about 28,@@ 1 per cent of new registr@@ ations , falling according to power stations ( KBA ) alone in August on this segment . &quot;

it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; thus the volume of the volume , also well s@@ ells , the new Astr@@ a should also not be much more expensive . &quot;

&quot; the Federal Constitu@@ tional Court has given a Ex @-@ po@@ ison of the Pen@@ al Institutions , which was located right in a small cell . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are entitled to a financial compensation , if they are housed in small cells . &quot;
this has decided the Federal Constitu@@ tional Court in a decision on Wednesday published Wednesday .
suffer@@ ers may even hope to put the judges even then on money if they were imprison@@ ed only a few days in the narrow rooms ( az . : 1 Bv@@ R 112@@ 7 / 14 ) .
&quot; this was a ex @-@ pris@@ ed with his constitutional delay in Karlsruhe : he was lod@@ ged with a single plot with approximately five square metres of ground floor , the toilet was not separated . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man who has been left with the indications of his life by now on free foot , in a larger cell . &quot;
his am@@ us@@ ation def@@ ec@@ age because of the mis@@ er@@ able warran@@ t against the land of Berlin prev@@ ail .
&quot; yet , the constitutional delay took the judgment of the Chamber of the Chamber of Berlin and transferred the case to the renewed verification . &quot;
you will see the man bre@@ ach of the man .
Kam@@ mer@@ gers now decide on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons from the frag@@ ile period only a few days of liability for compensation , be a balance of balance whatsoever , was called it . &quot;
otherwise it would be a short@@ ened of the legal status of the personality to fear .
the chamber must now clari@@ fy the amount of the money .
the constitutional delay in the past often have often strengthened the rights of prisoners .
&quot; so they said only in April a her@@ b damage , because he was naked in a cell . &quot;
&quot; Human un@@ worthy is a decision of 2011 , according to the multi @-@ disciplinary establishment of a cell without separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Berlin Philharmonic also confirmed the Berlin Constitu@@ tional Court , which had a hum@@ ling in a parallel settlement in November 2009 . &quot;
&quot; at the then , it was a day between 15 to 21 hours a day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell , as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case . &quot;
the Berlin pris@@ ons have come into the Headlines during the last few weeks .
&quot; prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours , the ag@@ gres@@ siv@@ ity rising , even because of the ten@@ se situation already come . &quot;
&quot; according to information of the adjust@@ ing press@@ ors , 21 places in cones are not occupied , 19 should 2016 away . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the re@@ fuge@@ e policy : &quot; we create it &quot;
immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; around 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany according to the forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Federal Ministry of Germany , following the statement of vice @-@ anz@@ ler Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SD@@ P ) , Germany is even able to take a million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) has given the unusual challenge to demonstrate : &quot; I say again and again : we can create it and we create it . &quot;
what matters in Germany is convey@@ ed the following overview .
&quot; before various forecasts between 35@@ 0000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Economics ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) Apartments - and the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as before being built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
&quot; dramatic is the lack of living room , but above all in paying guests : 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 pil@@ ates out of the rental time , and in order to apply this particularly favourable apartments will also be elig@@ ible for refugees . &quot;
&quot; Federal Ministry of Minister H@@ end@@ ri@@ cks ( SD@@ P ) , therefore , I want to double the promotion , currently 518 million to one billion euros . &quot;
too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 pil@@ ots have had to be created and would have to invest in the Bund for funding in the amount of 6.6 billion per year .
&quot; in this , scientists and the Federal Minister of Finance have to give more tax subsi@@ dies for investments in housing construction . &quot;
&quot; according to the assessment of the Institute for labor market and occupational research , the 55 percent of the post@@ ers in Germany must be employed . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany would have been asked about their qualifications to help them to get started with the introduction , Claudia Walter , project management for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
but it is crucial for the integration of refugees but it is important for the integration of refugees .
&quot; labor is the key to social contacts , for the este@@ em in the society society , but also for self @-@ este@@ em of the immigration society , says Mig@@ rations medi@@ an Diet@@ rich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , it was given a political shift : from the work offered to refugees for the recognition of labour . &quot;
&quot; while there was an ongoing trial for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this will be reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the Resi@@ den@@ im forti@@ fied , the asylum seek@@ ers limited to a place of residence . &quot;
&quot; in society - also because of the field of the labour @-@ labour @-@ labour , the perspective that refugees should be implemented quickly to allow employment to the labour market . &quot;
a large hur@@ d@@ le for access to the labour market are lack of knowledge .
&quot; so far , there is still no improvement in the offer of general and in @-@ related language courses . &quot;
analysis also show that jobs most often be communic@@ ated by personal contacts .
the construction of networks is therefore a view to the throne of the kingdom to work integration .
&quot; the Berlin school administration has established that only a few refugees @-@ parents give their children to the kit@@ as , roughly ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the ent@@ om@@ ed parents , it is only once very important to meet the family , &quot; says Il@@ ja Co@@ quim@@ bar , speaker for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration . &quot;
&quot; to convince the family from the advantages of the K@@ ita , distri@@ butes the administration of manual operations in various languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need for appro@@ aching a large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase capacity capacity by the Berlin Senate , by allowing more tra@@ inees . &quot;
in the countries students are prepared without knowledge classes in the classes .
&quot; however , they are not always taught by full instruc@@ tors and teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by educational , who have only a qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no lack of interest in them , says Be@@ ate St@@ ager from the Berlin school administration . &quot;
the German Stud@@ enten@@ werk is estimated that about 20 percent of refugees in Germany wants to study .
&quot; in principle , no state asylum seek@@ ers or in@@ dul@@ ted the study - the only exception was so far Berlin , In@@ sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) now has given its position . &quot;
a study of study refugees could be facilit@@ ated to the higher education institution .
&quot; for refugees with a pro@@ vocation or di@@ vorce , do not get any services according to the asylum seeker , more when they begin to study . &quot;
&quot; the latter , generally not get a BA@@ Fö@@ G , as it does not fall under the circle of the del@@ ayed persons . &quot;
&quot; cl@@ ay@@ ed refugees had to have lived in Germany so far , to be elig@@ ible to be elig@@ ible in Germany , from 1 January 2016 to short@@ ens this s@@ anne on 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but this financial pres@@ sur@@ es must be closed , but ask Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin@@ s State Secretary for Science , and the German Stud@@ enten@@ werk &quot;
the students should immediately get BA@@ Fö@@ G .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , the religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should be the same rights as they have the same rights as they have the churches , and to further develop the existing state @-@ churches in a new state of religion . &quot;
important would be the founding of a Islamic welfare state which car@@ es professional to take care of the re@@ fu@@ elling .
the rights are also obligations .
&quot; thus , the representative of Islam must be a clear contact person and ready to work with the state in many areas and give them some control possibilities . &quot;
&quot; this also includes the willingness , to set up against religious fundament@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; the chairman of the central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ e@@ k , expressed on Thursday the concern , religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany . &quot;
those who wanted such conflicts in Germany have immediately wanted their right to stay here in Germany ; he said he said in the Bav@@ arian radio .
he proposed to translate the Basic Law on Arabic .
there will be a lot more than today to be a topic of the whole society in future .
&quot; thus , the majority of society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism will change . &quot;
&quot; in Germany - as a result of European decisions , there has been an anti @-@ discri@@ min@@ atory system for a decade and a general gender equality law . &quot;
&quot; but it became very slow , how the NS@@ U series showed , in the police and authorities the rac@@ ist mot@@ if are system@@ atically ignored . &quot;
&quot; equal chances for all : what migrants organizations , and the interest groups of non @-@ white against international agreements as the anti @-@ raci@@ al in@@ vention Deutschland commit , must stay in the next few years when the country will remain peac@@ efully and use its new citizens - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is able to provide so far expected to feed refugees , do practi@@ se health @-@ President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gomery . &quot;
&quot; what Man@@ - Power and capacities are concerned , we create it , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , there are also common to flow money into the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid Eng@@ ob@@ asses , calls for Mont@@ gomery , all the com@@ ers equal to the registration of health products . &quot;
services could later be settled with the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; and in the long term , it was highly ques@@ tion@@ able to explain so many people with the restricted @-@ specific production process , which the asylum seeker . &quot;
otherwise make the doctors above all the language barri@@ ers to create .
&quot; so far , the Berlin Public Health @-@ scientist in The@@ a Bor@@ de has been proven , migrants are worse off their diseases than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , even in medical practice would have to be accepted interpre@@ ting costs , calls them . &quot;
it would be helped with many refugees but also with more gener@@ aliz@@ ations in the emergency @-@ department .
and with another diagnostic view .
under re@@ fuge@@ e vines such as it is significantly more untreated disabilities ; and in the young people it go to HIV @-@ enlight@@ en@@ ment .
&quot; with the partially other health @-@ bil@@ ders German doctors from their education , but clear , mi@@ tigation Mont@@ gomery . &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ite be@@ ak or tu@@ ber@@ culos@@ is are not so difficult to detect . &quot; and what is concerned with the ir@@ ility , be even un@@ avo@@ ided by refugees in sight . &quot;
Syri@@ ans would have had a developing educational system , a couple of refugees and even doctors . &quot;
&quot; in order to practic@@ ing practice , however , they would have to im@@ ply their qualification and ref@@ used again . &quot;
&quot; at least half of those in Germany to come , after estimates of bund@@ ling physi@@ que ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) psych@@ ically sick , most suffer from an post traumatic stress @-@ failure or under depression . &quot;
&quot; especially vulnerable , be re@@ fuge@@ e interviews , explains Diet@@ rich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recent published study of TU München has been occupied that every fifth sy@@ re @-@ re@@ fuge@@ e re@@ fuge@@ e c@@ avi@@ ties occur in Germany .
&quot; who is going on an post @-@ traumatic stress reduction , suff@@ ers among others in so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with respir@@ atory , go@@ dd@@ le and dead@@ lines . &quot;
&quot; more symptoms are bed@@ - and concent@@ ric disorders , strong sever@@ ity and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent the symptoms are chron@@ ically would be an early treatment necessary , stated Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; until now , only four percent of psych@@ ic sick refugees have received a psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; though , psych@@ ic diseas@@ ed asylum seek@@ ers can present an application for psych@@ otherapy , but the processing usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they would not be educated in the social contr@@ actor or doctors who are not trained for the psych@@ ic diseases , whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; lead frequently to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;

H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build up to 30.@@ 000 jobs in the context of restructuring and savings efforts at the company &apos;s services .
&quot; in this year , HP will be divided into two different companies later and separate the computer and printers business from his fast growing company hardware and its service business activities . &quot;
the expected actu@@ ation result leads to a load of over 2,@@ 7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in a statement . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will allow a competitive , more competitive costs for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ president and Chief Executive that should lead the unity of separation . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise is focused less and stronger than it is HP today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of shops that support companies in transition to a new style of business &quot; , &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
as a stand@@ alone company we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 bn US $ and &quot; will be focused on providing war@@ ri@@ fied technology solutions to companies so that an explanation of the company .

FC Arsen@@ al @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta tells you that team@@ food face before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ enger stressed towards Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and provided that his rehabilitation after plan is there , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly be missed at least the next four games for England and in view of its history , its participation in the next summer is most uncert@@ ain . &quot;
&quot; the great shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere has ended the last season after a separate le@@ aks injury , and then returned to his old PDA during the pres@@ eas@@ on . &quot;
&quot; this kind of injury does not threat the career , &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
it is a bone that is not well done .
this is not a greater case .
this was only an accident .
&quot; it was not in connection with his daughters , or with the inj@@ uries that he had before . &quot;
&quot; this may be true of purely medical view , but as W@@ enger also recognized , there is the related danger of other inj@@ uries , always when a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops a uncomfortable pattern .
the study of Premier In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut in six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of ar@@ sen@@ als 157 lig@@ aments in the last five seasons .
the wid@@ est picture for ar@@ sen@@ al is that they have been at six of eight play@@ times since 2007 / 08 one of the two Premier League clubs which have recorded most vulner@@ abilities .
&quot; tight accepts the potential of a dev@@ ils , but ar@@ sen@@ al believes that an improvement in the loss of injury is going during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , if you return from an injury , you have a sus@@ cep@@ tible period of time , a time in which you strengthen your body and win ? &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope to stabili@@ ze his body , I am confident that he will do it and he will run a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
ar@@ sen@@ al begins its Champions League this season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the Games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ sp@@ ur am coming Wednesday , and W@@ enger makes a rotation within the team . &quot;
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelled to Croatia that may start Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ uch@@ y and Art@@ eta .
W@@ enger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gi@@ b@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and The@@ o Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and the players who need it , a small car@@ nival , &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
&quot; although ar@@ sen@@ al clear favorites are to share with group of F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ tim@@ id@@ y@@ ale effect in Europe . &quot;
&quot; Dynam@@ o is also un@@ be@@ aten after 41 games , after the &quot; &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was started in the last season . &quot;
the stadium was sh@@ aken on Tuesday night by an earthquake that were measured at the Rich@@ ter@@ sk@@ ala .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; close is the opinion that ar@@ sen@@ al has drawn the teaching from the past season with the Champions League &apos;s capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and remains committed by the remote hope to lead the association with its first European ap@@ oc@@ al tri@@ umph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immen@@ sely , &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
it has never worked at ar@@ sen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer . &quot;
friendly Fe@@ ast : the Com@@ edy show that gave us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships !
&quot; the absence of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need@@ y for men to open themselves , now still further des@@ perate than ever before has happened to young men on a 15 @-@ year course . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important death of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the United Kingdom , and it remains more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to announce the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ain@@ st Living Mis@@ er@@ ent ( calm - campaign against a her@@ edit@@ ary life ) 2015 than the year of the man , with the goal of asking the culture to question , asking the men to seek help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the heart to master this challenge .
&quot; a recent study with more than 2,@@ 000 high school pupils with press@@ ants fixed that when the passionate women had a enough high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood &quot; , &quot; his chances of satisfaction has double . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , hal@@ ved a circle of spiritual healthy friends the risks of mental problems . &quot;
but of course you have to have made friends to make a friendship .
&quot; in the age of social media guid@@ ing communications , with its focus on style about substance is the indi@@ gen@@ ability of answer often more important than a meaning@@ ful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital life have the need to be strong , viable and successful to appear , dou@@ bled , even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologist ex@@ trinsic values call ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trinsic values - our inner long@@ ing for personal development and friendship , which affects our mental health much more profound . &quot;
and how a video invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire did recently declared , money can not buy luck really . &quot;
the Beautiful at Friends was that these focus was placed on the head .
&quot; every character was not defined by his work , but by his personality defined by interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent h@@ ugs , Mom@@ ents at so@@ ccer , and the long@@ ing of Ros@@ s after Rachel - all this came out of knowledge that men can definitely refer to any case , even though they often keep herself to explore , completely their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as an employee of the phone care I explained : ... &quot; my audi@@ ences for people who feel de@@ pressed and confident , showed me really clearly how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
&quot; the males who can contact us , often feel not able to speak with friends . &quot;
&quot; the old &quot; &quot; I come &quot; &quot; come &quot; &quot; a tremendous impact as the feeling that it is percei@@ ved as a weakness if one speaks about problems openly . &quot;
&quot; Friends &quot; &quot; Friends &quot; &quot; is one of the shows that arri@@ ves to me in the mind if I try to offer long @-@ term rin@@ se mechanisms . &quot;
it clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
&quot; as much my objective out@@ sider trading on the phone , can also help people in the eye of desp@@ air , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , if you attend this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest when you celebrate the day totally newly designed setting , why do not take your friends to have a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or even better if you &apos;re sitting in Star@@ bu@@ cks , you can see him alone , give him a smile and say Hi . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .

&quot; Maria meets to help you eat , mal@@ m@@ ö . &quot;
Angel Di Maria celeb@@ rates Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Edin@@ son Cav@@ ani after his hit opposite Mal@@ m@@ ö .
&quot; Maria meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps to go to Mal@@ m@@ ö . &quot;
here are the play@@ ful and the reaction to the game .
&quot; Angel Di Maria and Edin@@ son Cav@@ ani held a course , as Paris Saint @-@ Germain its Champions League season with a extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 win against Mal@@ m@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ ley stadium on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as PSG ProntoSIL players who raised the French master over the way , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally sc@@ ored their prot@@ ru@@ sion than Cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1st minute a head sm@@ ector . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and S@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k Group also in the group A needs Paris a strong start against the Swedish Masters , as it does not only serve the qualification for the two separate rounds , but an improvement on the road to the quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , there was no class@@ ement of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ him@@ o@@ vic@@ s ver@@ ished opportunities before the gate . he was later started in the game against his hom@@ et@@ own team and against the association with whom he began his illustr@@ ate career already in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to win home or out@@ ward in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to cause 2 : 0 to win our enemy problems and also relaxed , even if there are certain things we have to stay in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a good sign . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we won &apos;t have one or two other gates . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic returned after his injury in one of three changes in the Paris team , that was a 2 : 2 un@@ decided on his place at Bordeaux in the first League , but he was st@@ olen from the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine whis@@ ky was then described as a man who was taken to the next stage in Europe , when he ran into the last month of Manchester United , and he pointed out why , when he ran into Joh@@ an Wil@@ and pass nicely into the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; however , someone believed that he would achieve a great victory that was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Mal@@ m@@ ö , the Cel@@ tic proposed in a Play @-@ off , in order to reach this level , with nine national players on the field and had a five @-@ scale defence and two deep positioned in the middle @-@ field . &quot;
&quot; but except a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , the far taken to Kevin Tr@@ apps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 34@@ th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead she gave himself at times , with some mal@@ nour@@ ishment and poor deals , not least from I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , who was not less than five verses alone in the first half of the scrat@@ ched and then abandoned , after Cav@@ ani had inserted him after the start . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless he pointed out much more happ@@ ick when he carried his fellow @-@ player into play , and it was a pass of I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , the Di Maria in a tor@@ ch turned out , which was distr@@ acted by Wil@@ de in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pas@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; the second gate fell slightly shortly after the hours brand thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Uruguay : achieved his sixth string , after I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic had a left side of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; the ended all thoughts on that Mal@@ m@@ ö could come back in the game , and only an excellent entry by Wil@@ and from the short@@ est distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , was able to stop the end result , before spare @-@ Player E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was detected by the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Mal@@ m@@ ö , Age Har@@ eide , gave later that he played a class above his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; &quot; our last Champions League game was last year last year . &quot;
&quot; since then , we only played in the Swedish League , which has not the same level . &quot;
the qualification games are not enough . &quot;
Hu@@ t from before Paris !
it was a great game of them !

Det@@ roit Tig@@ ers Gr@@ ills at Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins past
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Det@@ roit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; formerly they were one of the best teams in the Bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers stand on the last square in the American League Central . &quot;
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as Sp@@ o@@ iler but played this part perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target Field .
the T@@ wins attacked a chance for A@@ scen@@ sion within a play half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ Card .
&quot; for Det@@ roit , although only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so hard to gr@@ asp the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all vict@@ ories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad A@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; tiger Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon kept its early offen@@ sive support , as Det@@ roit three times in the first two inside , then once in the sixth , and then once more in the nin@@ th . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit 6 times in the 1 / 3 cour@@ age@@ ings and made possible three R@@ uns .
it was only his third start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year strong , &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to throw in the Bul@@ l@@ pen each game , and so I want to go back in the game . &quot;
&quot; design@@ ate Tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first r@@ alled since mid August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first three @-@ hit @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle Hol@@ ders on July 6 . &quot;
&quot; he has done the stroke well , &quot; said sp@@ m . &quot;
&quot; he looked good out of the ( soul training ) , looked clearly better in the Bul@@ l@@ ring , and he brought it to the game . &quot;
&quot; with three vines at the end of the seventh , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into play . &quot;
center F@@ iel@@ der B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left field line .
right F@@ iel@@ ders Aaron H@@ icks has reached a flo@@ od and Simon brought his second baz@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier on Stri@@ ket@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Hard@@ y .
&quot; Hard@@ y over@@ ran the wall , the only man , with whom he became confront@@ ed , in front of the design@@ ate R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ Schlag@@ mann Miguel S@@ ano , who is the right @-@ handed version of Dre@@ w Ver@@ h@@ agen a Two @-@ Run . &quot;
with a pair of run@@ ners and the completion of the second brought ver@@ ick the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor lo@@ ops up to one Double Play .
&quot; it was that in the Major League &apos;s leading 27 times in this season , that pl@@ ou@@ ps proposed a double Play
&quot; after Det@@ roit at the end of the nin@@ th out@@ ings make a Insurance @-@ Run , managed by the B@@ BI @-@ Double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce R@@ ond@@ on , and achieved the status of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
but the right @-@ handed stands for S@@ ano with three pitch for his fifth file .
Det@@ roit prof@@ ited for the pr@@ el@@ ude of the game of an even non mov@@ able Phil Hug@@ hes .
&quot; the tig@@ ers sc@@ ored three R@@ uns in the first two out@@ ings against the right @-@ handed @-@ veter@@ an , which was cancelled in front of the game of inj@@ uries , after having been missing for a sp@@ inal cord more than a month . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wish , I said Mr Hug@@ hes , &quot; &quot; said Mr Hug@@ hes , &quot; &quot; said Mr Hug@@ hes , when I put up and sense that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches as in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after having received the Le@@ ad@@ off bat@@ ter , Hus@@ band gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Fe@@ sler . &quot;
a two @-@ out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z in the game that made a single &quot; up the Middle &quot; at the first Run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed to create his 0 @-@ 21 track series with the run@@ ners in the sc@@ oring position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed by a single on the right hand , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game than he tried to get to the third that the threat was closed . &quot;
the Tig@@ ers placed in the second one to achieved a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ ding Anthony G@@ osis for 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ it@@ or . &quot;
&quot; he has not be@@ aten very well , but he has the right place . &quot;
Hug@@ hes was in a pitch @-@ Coun@@ t where he had no points in the third inning before he was replaced by the rel@@ ic jurisdiction of A.@@ J.@@ Ach@@ ter .
&quot; for Hug@@ hes , it came to three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four cor@@ ps . &quot;
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z divided into account of a violation of the wor@@ m industry .
he is investig@@ ated by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the Schul@@ er of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .

the EU states have so far failed to agree on a common approach to the crisis .
&quot; on the coming Tuesday ( 22 September ) , the EU ministers want to take a new approach to binding distribution of another 120 000 refugees . &quot;
&quot; given the strong re@@ fuge@@ e brand in Germany , the federal government wants to support the federal states in the initial intake and distribution of the people . &quot;
&quot; the Bund def@@ ended this together with the countries , announced Merkel at the late afternoon evening after almost four @-@ hour consultation with Prime Minister in the ch@@ anc@@ ellor of Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ coat , those people , the protection , reb@@ els these too . &quot;
&quot; but who did not have a lead perspective , could not remain in Germany too . &quot;
this idea was clearly split in the round .

Rome now has a Martin @-@ Lu@@ ther @-@ Square
almost 500 years after the Reformation there is now a Martin @-@ Lu@@ ther Square .
in the presence of Stadt@@ Vice President Ig@@ na@@ zio Marino on Wednesday a hi@@ red square in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill was bap@@ tis@@ ed on the name of the German reform .
&quot; at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; he will now be hon@@ oured as &quot; German The@@ ologist of the Reformation . &quot;
the park lies in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the Cultur@@ es of the evangel@@ ical Church@@ es in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , priest of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , re@@ minded on Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es over centuries , often only in secret their faith . &quot;
&quot; with the place I will be visible in the symbo@@ lic manner , that their tradition of the Christian faith in Rome was welcome . &quot;
Martin Lu@@ ther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was held as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k to the y@@ early retirement 15@@ 10 / 11 several months in Rome .
he received the city back then as dec@@ im@@ ed sin @-@ fork .
his negative impressions may have encouraged him to join Rome according to histori@@ ans in his later fight against Rome .
Lu@@ ther was then introduced with his theories on the Ab@@ out@@ sh@@ andel the spl@@ itting of the final church .
hammer artist inv@@ ented three years into personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( g@@ ild@@ ed ) Dorn@@ enk@@ rone is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and Bible @-@ tex@@ tual updates .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible that is now released with splendid paintings now . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , the picture was formulated for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his very personal interpre@@ tations Bi@@ b@@ lical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has preserved the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means equal to &quot; funny &quot; pictures . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , the respective themes can be quite thin . &quot;
&quot; nearly three years Ot@@ mar Old has worked on his bi@@ ble project for which he has made a subjective artistic selection from the many different topics of the &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these are cycles of cycles , the topics like cru@@ ising , pl@@ agues , command@@ ments or co@@ ater@@ ally . &quot;
he has spont@@ ane@@ ously fascinated by several partners : this applies to the Lu@@ ther Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation and the Kettler publisher with its focus on art books .
and since the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost is based on the painting with the respective Bible sets .
&quot; he has interpreted the Bible designated by Ot@@ mar Old Bi@@ bel@@ ungs and thus translated into the pre@@ y , into current inter@@ relations . &quot;
these texts are as Verbal mirror of Al@@ ts Pain@@ t@@ ings .
&quot; nestled among the original Bible county of Martin Lu@@ ther , and each one sentence of the artist , who were formulated his very personal thoughts on the specific situation . &quot;
the cl@@ asp has golden letters .
&quot; thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , its emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
&quot; Emotions were ultimately born to all trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Old , 1940 in Wer@@ nig@@ ero@@ de and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family who belong to the strict prot@@ est@@ ant country . &quot;
&quot; since the education happened once with the pipe , Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
&quot; I have tried to work up , to carry me back with the Lord father again . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to help the art in quick@@ er time to help : &quot; &quot; the perception of imaging , is today shaped by Re@@ kl@@ ame , and which is loud . &quot;
Symbol@@ ism is being shi@@ fted .
artists have a different desire and her@@ er to show things .
pictures always have something secret and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ os@@ au@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the spect@@ ators put into the pictures &quot; let them work , discover and feel what power they have : &quot; the picture is looking for his opponents . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost and on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; has always been &quot; &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Art &quot; , &quot; I like to compre@@ h@@ end his pictures . &quot;
&quot; I have not informed the Bible completely to gr@@ asp the Bible , but that is important for him as well as mysterious topics . &quot;
&quot; this was no collaboration on eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the images , the text merely explains . &quot;
&quot; for Hans Mö@@ hler from the Lu@@ ther @-@ Verlag this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Images speak for se@@ duc@@ tors both the ( bib@@ lical ) language of love and responsibility .
part of the origin@@ als - paper and linen paintings - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition which will be opened on 15th November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
start @-@ up for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn
&quot; plans to be found , place found , companies charge , stra@@ in@@ age for a round course : a year later was almost everything ready - but still before the official opening of the BM@@ X subway has been finally finished . &quot;
&quot; om@@ issions in politics and administration were responsible for desp@@ air , especially among the inhabitants that the rail@@ ways were not toler@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; so hill sec@@ lu@@ ded , new place for - now with formal planning and application for building permit . &quot;
&quot; the approval will be noti@@ fied in October , the First Association of Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck could now share in the nur@@ sery and youth Committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope that this year happens more visible , &quot; she said . &quot;
it will then be started without &quot; further mem@@ or@@ ry &quot; with the works at the former indoor swimming pool .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fied commitment for refugees
the DF@@ B exp@@ ands its commitment to refugees from 2019 to 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga will take a clear sign in the weekend . &quot;
the football re@@ acts to the con@@ cis@@ e position in Germany and sec@@ ures its policies with the help of t@@ ackl@@ ing the problems of the upcoming problems .
&quot; I consider this , the biggest challenge of our land since the re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; however , in principle no one can say , I do not do anything , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this must be of every single interest to get this topic in the handle , &quot; said DF@@ B @-@ Chef Wolfgang N@@ ier@@ sbach . &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to intensi@@ fy the re@@ fuge@@ e situation in Germany on 23 September .
&quot; I am next Wednesday in the ch@@ anc@@ ellor and tre@@ ats there the state Minister Mrs Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the ch@@ anc@@ ellor . &quot;
&quot; since the topic will certainly play a central role , he announced . &quot;
the football could help .
but the decisive Switch must face the policy .
the German football Federation has therefore expanded its re@@ fuge@@ e &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; for four years .
&quot; about the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun @-@ Foundation , we have ensured that this program is continuing to continue by 2019 , &quot; stated N@@ ier@@ sbach on the edge of the U@@ EF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
also some states support this program .
&quot; already this weekend the 36 profil@@ ing a clear sign , if they are on the left tri@@ kot@@ ers instead of the usual sponsorship logos ( her@@ mes ) the Auf@@ druck Disc &quot; We will help - # re@@ aliz@@ es@@ welcome . &quot;
&quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how to only can , &quot; said L@@ ever@@ kus@@ ie Sport@@ alm Rud@@ i V@@ ö@@ ller &quot; &quot; Zeitung ( Tuesday ) and referred to as &quot; self @-@ comprehen@@ sibility . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ fuge@@ e drama goes every one , neither may it be able to see . &quot;
&quot; we can use football Bundes@@ liga , no , we have to use our strength , our influence and our ways to help the many refugees who have already so incredibly gel@@ ells , to help , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim Managing Director Peter retreat spoke of a &quot; prominent signs of the League . &quot;
EM @-@ Quali@@ fication game against Hungary on the country charges the national team of women 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; N@@ ier@@ sbach testi@@ fies the support of refugees as &quot; a large communal area of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 licenses have been started in their places their own projects was great .
just as great it is that small and smallest clubs are very active .
&quot; the message &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; which we have spent , will be lived in football . &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this year and next year , the association will jointly contribute to the integration of refugees with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government each of 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have also called the whole amount for 2015 , &quot; &quot; N@@ ier@@ sbach . &quot;
reports : SAP Stab@@ ili@@ zer loses an eye in an accident
&quot; the resistance of Europe largest software Group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has lost several reports , according to a fall of July the left eye . &quot;
&quot; in the accident at the stair@@ way in his brother &apos;s house he had fallen in the United States after midnight , which he carried on into the left hand of the &quot; &quot; Economic week &quot; &quot; of the week . &quot;
&quot; he is almost embarrass@@ ed , has turned out of Tan@@ pp@@ t on the road - that he told us so the last week , &quot; c@@ ited the &quot; Wi@@ where &quot; SAP @-@ co @-@ founder of the has@@ n plat@@ ner . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could go out of his work .
&quot; early October we meet in front of the super@@ visory board in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Turn@@ table . &quot;
the 54 years old manager will be with the meeting and &quot; full work @-@ capable . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; South German newspaper &quot; ( Thurs@@ days exchange ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue performing the software group in October . &quot;
&quot; I am full for SAP , fully in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was all the time in a regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so plat@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t p@@ end@@ elt usually between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP head@@ office in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to him with such a personal story to the public , the manager of &quot; SZ &quot; : &quot; everyone can happen that something . &quot;
&quot; important is to stand up again , when you go down . &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ replacement pilot Mag@@ n@@ osis besides skir@@ m@@ ish ...
&quot; Mag@@ n@@ osis y@@ az@@ ates an appropriate photo and explained , he put the bre@@ ach of the bre@@ ach , when he pl@@ ung@@ ed by the wheel . &quot;
he therefore comes from rep@@ ented in Singapore on the weekend as little as a reser@@ voir for the two mill@@ ers Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and Jen@@ son Button in@@ question how a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
Soccer : b@@ v@@ b without re@@ us against Kras@@ no@@ dar : Weiden@@ f@@ eller in the gate
Bor@@ ussia Dortmund saw all hopes on a com@@ eb@@ ack of Marco Re@@ us in the first group game of Europe League finally sm@@ ashed .
the national player is also missing the Table of the football Bundes@@ liga as well as in du@@ el with the F@@ K Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 o / Sky ) .
&quot; we cannot rely on him unfortunately , &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ top@@ spiel against L@@ ever@@ k@@ usen , let the BV@@ B @-@ Coach open : &quot; we expect a return from him into training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high load of his pro@@ s , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change his pedi@@ gre@@ e position on the spot . &quot;
so he announced a change on the door@@ way .
that is why Roman Weiden@@ f@@ eller takes the place by Stamm@@ ke@@ eper Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he exercises on an absolute top level , &quot; pra@@ ised the football teacher the world champion . &quot;
&quot; whether the Weiden@@ er @-@ eller in the future is coming to use in all the Europe @-@ League games , Tu@@ ch@@ el left open . &quot;
with a high lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood he will also strive for the second participation .
&quot; the for@@ ested statement from fellow @-@ player re@@ us that the final count for the BV@@ B in the Europe League will be the goal , hold mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l for in@@ complete , &quot; this lies Marco not so wrong . &quot;
I think that we have a good chance to access the title .
Rob@@ oter@@ motor@@ s : government wants the pione@@ ering for Germany
&quot; in Germany , according to the will of the Federal Government on the change of the car of technological adv@@ ancing . &quot;
the Federal Cab@@ inet was decided on Wednesday a Strateg@@ ic ep@@ aper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( C@@ SU ) among other things investment in expanding digital infrastructure .
&quot; do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the automobile I@@ AA from a &quot; new mobili@@ en era . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the automated driving and connected driving will raise the road safety and ensure less st@@ oves , saying do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot;
&quot; he also wants to discuss the topic with his counter@@ part from the G@@ 7 states , who will also come together with representatives of the industry at the I@@ AA . &quot;
the Strateg@@ ic ep@@ ap@@ ier of the German Federal Ministry is stressed among other things the importance of mobile broad@@ band @-@ building and a high @-@ level as@@ cen@@ sion on digital radio .
the testing of new technology is currently taking a review on the 9 motorway in Bavaria .
&quot; so that the driver is no additional det@@ ain@@ able risks , the German government wants to examine the legal framework conditions and , where necessary , to adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; thus , Germany wants to stand up for instance for an international time that the permitted maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars raised from 10 to 130 tri@@ om@@ eters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the federal government wants to stand up for a change in the Vienna Convention so far from the human being as a driver . &quot;
&quot; with automated driving , the car is taking over the car , the driver becomes more and more to passenger . &quot;
&quot; the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras , which capture the environment and process data in a process . &quot;
&quot; according to the study by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , we will be technically possible by automated driving on high@@ ways up to 2020 . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , be expected to be expected on public roads &quot; &quot; only far from 2020 . &quot;
&quot; value creation in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the location of Germany , the authors of the study will appreciate around 8,@@ 4 billion euros . &quot;
&quot; the digital networking of the P@@ K@@ W@@ s can lead to greater security and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said the SPD @-@ Reports S@@ ör@@ en Bart@@ ol . &quot;
the issue of liability in cases of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clari@@ fied but clearly stated .
&quot; however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars tend to be sc@@ ep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday during the AA meeting of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the EU@@ TER DE@@ K@@ RA will lead to the outcome that only eight percent of Germans believe that their cars are expected to compete in the next ten years , 31 percent are expected not at all in it . &quot;
&quot; 21 percent of the respon@@ dents until 2025 with aut@@ on@@ om driving cars , in the USA 33 percent . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; following a survey of digital &apos;s Bit@@ k@@ om , only seven percent would agree to take control during the entire trip on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the highway that could reach 15 percent in flowing traffic at least 15 percent , in the St@@ au 45 percent . &quot;
good every voting would leave your car under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says teamwork and a double @-@ start at bi @-@ EM
the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer wants to compete with the same stand at the cover of 25 September until 4 October .
the final decision should be handed down at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; this is a great loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; we are however heavily enough , even without Tim@@ o the title to pick , &quot; said War@@ est@@ rainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the EM workshop in Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; B@@ oll was on this point on the flight to a long @-@ term , sponsorship contract in China . &quot;
the 34 years old German champion is expected on Friday .
&quot; without Tim@@ o is the dis@@ advantage , we are now no longer such a clear Favor@@ ite , &quot; explained single @-@ europe@@ am@@ ei@@ ster Dim@@ it@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; Ham@@ el@@ ner , who goes the arm@@ chair in J@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , but re@@ minded of the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; back then Tim@@ o was also missing , and we are Europe again grown . &quot;
&quot; in this case , we should base ourselves , &quot; explained the world of the world of the world . &quot;
the English football @-@ national player Luke Sha@@ w von Manchester United has raised a severe violation at the right .
&quot; in the Champions League game at PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven , the def@@ ender was made with a backl@@ ash by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno and changed after long treatment . &quot;
the first diagnosis is marked with the 20 year old co @-@ player from Bas@@ tian &apos;s rul@@ ers to a shift .
Gaul@@ ette feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant :
it is a mix of great fashion show and a guard of the Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ ette ( 63 ) wrote an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : display mannequ@@ ins which look thanks to video projects .
&quot; they bear the spectacular creations from the French designer , who has been with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits into the great star of the fashion scene - and therefore that he added men in Rö@@ cke &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant of the Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; previously it was so easy , meanwhile it &apos;s genuine , &quot; said Gaul@@ ette . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The S@@ ide@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk , which is seen from the 18th of September at the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o @-@ Cultural Foundation , it is a happiness that the Mo@@ des@@ ch@@ öpf@@ er has changed his y@@ early attitude toward a fin@@ au about his person . &quot;
&quot; actually he has been on the other hand , for : &quot; for me sound@@ ed a little bit of death , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when you die , you get into the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously made in can@@ adian Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; it is about so much more than just beautiful dres@@ ses , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Die@@ deren . &quot;
&quot; go to tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; exhibits will give an insight into the man &apos;s view@@ able work , which has written Mo@@ de@@ history without ever have an education . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ olog@@ ically is the show is not constructed , but it is an excellent , chore@@ o@@ graph instrument , for which much effort was operated : to run the d@@ olls , for example its sty@@ list is engaged . &quot;
14 tons of material made the cre@@ ators according to the indications of the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot by Munich .
just before the start of the Okto@@ ber@@ fest was still a special shot : a leder@@ h@@ osen @-@ Out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Heidi meets Madonna .
&quot; he always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; women are car@@ vers &quot; &quot; ) and for men who are a bit different , &quot; &quot; no@@ tier . &quot;
also Gaul@@ ette Teddy Teddy is to be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; it stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ liable fashion@@ ed cas@@ ual of the designer . &quot;
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad@@ ly in football ) he attracted his Teddy Bear and dres@@ ses .
&quot; playing with a d@@ oll , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot;
mode of mode did he later have brought up itself later .
he st@@ ems Mo@@ de@@ tim@@ ers and saw the designs of other designer to be told in Munich to the Gaul@@ ette in Munich .
later I bought it but of course .
he did not pay for his first own fashion show .
&quot; they got nothing , but the plumbing is kept . &quot;
jewellery instead of Gard@@ ins - Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze as fashion @-@ niche
earlier it went to the long embroider@@ y machines in and around Pl@@ auen to cut metres .
&quot; the Emb@@ ro@@ i@@ dered substances and peaks origin@@ ated in large quantities for customers , which they have processed for example to blan@@ kets and she@@ er curtains . &quot;
&quot; this alone does not work today , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Mo@@ vies and Gre@@ ys . &quot;
instead the fashion is important again .
&quot; in the early times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze played mode a greater role , then has been driven by the home textile industry and is now re@@ discovered as niche . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt is called some examples : top in jewelry , in accessories such as bags and in regional trails . &quot;
&quot; at all , the so @-@ called Vintage fashion , which is committed to past styl@@ istic meeting , increasing number of potential . &quot;
&quot; who in the textile industry in Germany do not have any nas@@ al service , is no longer on the market . &quot;
in case of us they already produce half of all orders .
compos@@ ites Gre@@ ys is a member of nine further companies a member of the branch @-@ association Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and embroider@@ ies .
only they may carry the protected label .
in the last 15 years there were about 80 percent of its sales .
private specialized shops and also the wholesale prices are available almost no more .
our products can hardly be able to reach our clients on this way .
the mass ware will nowadays have much cheaper than manufactured in the Asian region and almost exclusively distributed via chains .
&quot; also , we@@ aker the export , currently to Russia and in the USA . &quot;
enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association tries to score points as Cor@@ dul@@ a Bauer by Stick@@ per@@ le expl@@ aining in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; since this year we run a quality seal , which shows that we produce eco @-@ friendly and socially responsible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt follows : &quot; this also refers to the used materials . &quot;
diplom@@ a Th@@ te Schmidt te@@ aches at the Snow@@ leader of the West@@ s@@ äch@@ s@@ ische Hochschule Zwickau - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and speci@@ alizes in embroider@@ ies and l@@ ace .
&quot; to continue the competition from the Asian region , it has to find high quality and innovative products . &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designer and the factories that have to think economically , says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design often will only slightly varies in order to hold a customer base . &quot;
a few years ago a former Tex@@ i Re@@ uter &apos;s new snow@@ ball @-@ tip new .
we swallow@@ ed the machine in some places small kitchens .
&quot; the Pl@@ ush Gold@@ ev@@ ed@@ ges in Bianca Hall@@ eb@@ ach , inspired by it : &quot; &quot; previously I could start with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ board tip for their jewelry .
in an elabor@@ ate process they shaped the patterns in silver .
&quot; many people of the region identify with the topic Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; she also delivers to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers , whose ancestors have lived in Pl@@ auen and surroundings and who would like to have a re@@ membran@@ e . &quot;
this is how I see my jewelry as a modern Ambassador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze .

it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the Banks Banks in times of world economic crisis in England .

XI pus@@ hes the economy broader to open the world
&quot; the economy must be wider to the outside , to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group that was charged with the hand@@ leb@@ ar of the reform . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; China should stand up to improve foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business tal@@ ents , &quot; he said in a consultation at the 16th session of the central leadership group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot;
start@@ ups promote and stimul@@ ating reforms will bring new moment@@ um and vit@@ ality and offer new space for economic growth , said Xi . &quot;
&quot; the executive group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a neg@@ atives list to regul@@ ate the market access , relaxation of the limit level of control ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the resident of Mel@@ an@@ yst@@ ems . &quot;
&quot; after the statement , a neg@@ atives list will be created , the sectors and companies have not been identified for investments . &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs .
&quot; the initiative is of significance , since it proves to the market a greater role in the ingredi@@ ent of resources , a right state of business environment and open the market open , said the statement . &quot;
the government will also insp@@ ire controls on the deleg@@ ated powers and make sure that companies will decide how they carry out their business .
&quot; statement also said that China border areas allow , new models of cross @-@ border co @-@ operation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth . &quot;

EU wants to double @-@ cur@@ y thres@@ hold in smoking
&quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mer@@ cur@@ y in large rob@@ ber@@ y and consumers thereby a clearly higher dose of thr@@ ill gifts . &quot;
&quot; the consumer organization materi@@ ales , which is an appropriate work of the EU , specifically cri@@ tici@@ zed the plans : &quot; risks and side effects mis@@ placed industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full power in moment@@ um and inf@@ ants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of 50@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; hence , the limit values of the nervous system should be raised up for large fish@@ es at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish , of &quot; economic @-@ policy &quot; &quot; of one to two milli@@ gram mer@@ cur@@ y per kil@@ ograms of fish . &quot;
&quot; big ro@@ fish @-@ fish , however , are already as strong with mer@@ cur@@ y , that based on the still prev@@ ailing limit values are not sold for approximately 50 percent of the total length . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling of the limits , only 14.5 percent would be un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in return for this traction , the EU is aim@@ ing to al@@ ign the limit values in other fish from currently 0,5 cen@@ tig@@ ram on 0,1 milli@@ gram of 0.1 milli@@ gram cur@@ y per kil@@ ograms . &quot;
&quot; every@@ th@@ watch this but referred to as &quot; tri@@ ck , &quot; because smaller portions , such as carp usually are so low st@@ um@@ ed that they already hold the planned high@@ s already today . &quot;
&quot; lower@@ ing at Kl@@ esh@@ ly is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ des di@@ version man@@ eu@@ ver , that helps the economy alone , &quot; stated Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot;
mer@@ cur@@ y is one for the people of high @-@ tox@@ ic heavy metals which is greatly enrich@@ ed over the food chain above all in smoking .
&quot; the Federal Government thus war@@ ns that &quot; &quot; already low amounts of especially for inf@@ ants of the nervous system &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Federal Ministry of Justice refers to its homepage with regard to the current high values but that a &quot; health haz@@ ards of the general population is not expected .
mer@@ cur@@ y refers mainly through the co@@ le@@ vers in the environment .
&quot; the German co@@ le@@ power stations , according to a written information of the Federal Ministry of Economics , Ann@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ orn is more than six tons of mer@@ cur@@ y in the year , two thir@@ ds of the total volume of Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mer@@ cur@@ y in fishing around in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube is &quot; &quot; permanent and surface &quot; &quot; had been crossed out of the paper &quot; &quot; mirror &quot; &quot; in March . &quot;
