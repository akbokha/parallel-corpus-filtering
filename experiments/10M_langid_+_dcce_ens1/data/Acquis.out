whereas the agreement in the form of a letter to change the Annex A to the Agreement between 1 to the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss E@@ id@@ gen@@ ossen@@ schaft ( 1 ) is to conclude :
between the European nuclear community and the Swiss fran@@ co @-@ oper@@ atives in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plas@@ map@@ hysics
&quot; the EURO@@ PE nuclear community , below &quot; &quot; Eur@@ atom &quot; , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , below , &quot; &quot; Commission &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Swiss feder@@ ation , named &quot; &quot; Switzerland &quot; , &quot; represented by the Swiss Bundes@@ rat , listed &quot; Bundes@@ rat &quot; , &quot; &quot;
&quot; this program comprises the creation of a large tra@@ ys system , the project J@@ ET ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation of a common company after chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Agreement - can be transferred to the &quot; &quot; Joint Company J@@ ET &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Switzerland deals for several years with research projects in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plas@@ map@@ hysics and is well familiar with the relevant area concerned .
&quot; as far as the practical use of controlled nuclear fusion has even complete works , it is in the interest of the agreement to avoid un@@ necessary efforts to prevent un@@ necessary efforts to prevent un@@ necessary efforts to acceler@@ ate how to speed up a higher priorities due to the energy crisis . &quot;
&quot; this agreement should be able to put any contrac@@ tual partners in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plas@@ map@@ hysics from the representatives of controlled nuclear power , and thus the common objective of this research work , d.@@ h . the cost @-@ free competitive electricity production by making use of controlled nuclear power production , faster to achieve . &quot;
&quot; to achieve the target of the occurr@@ ence of the present agreement , the contract parties in Annex I and II of this agreement is defined in Annex I and II of this agreement , &quot; Eur@@ atom &apos;s program &quot; and &quot; Swiss program . &quot; &quot;

- to monitor the development of research projects and so that best results will be achieved in accordance with the goals of this agreement .
Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two deleg@@ ates in which the Eur@@ atom program used in the following &quot; &quot; VG &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the VG , the exchange of information and cooperation in all matters concerning the ongoing or planned programs and activities in the field of the Eur@@ atom program , this task refers to all research and development activities , focusing on this agreement . &quot;
&quot; it encour@@ ages in particular the cooperation and coordin@@ ating between the associated organs and judges their T * , in the interest of the two parties involved in the Eur@@ atom program and in the Swiss programme as well as in Article 1 of the present agreement , whereby the scientific and technological developments will be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; according to the action of their rules , VG one or more Swiss representatives at the framework of the Eur@@ atom program advis@@ ory services , whenever the responsible Swiss authorities are therefore looking forward . &quot;
&quot; the advis@@ ory groups , which determin@@ es the VG research proposals in terms of supporting scientific results , take this task with regard to all research and development work , resulting in this agreement with respect to all research and development work . &quot;
Switzerland is represented in the framework of the Eur@@ atom program used by the director of one of the participating laboratories .
&quot; to monitor the directors of the directors , who has been able to monitor the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program , which are involved in the framework of the program , the capacity to be used in terms of all research and development work which fall under the present agreement . &quot;
it especially ensures the best use of the personnel and for the exchange of the eff@@ es between laboratories that are involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program and the Swiss program .
a Swiss representative is entitled to participate in the meetings of all within the framework of the Eur@@ atom program .
&quot; the coordination of the directors involved in the scope of the directors involved in the respective field with knowledge , staff , as well as knowledge and skills , which are taking part in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program Labor@@ atori@@ ums , accept this task on the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program laboratories , which fall under the present agreement with regard to all research and development efforts . &quot;
&quot; the BA@@ F belong to the core - and energy @-@ research responsible for every member state of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and each affili@@ ated third state . &quot;
&quot; searching , the Commission advis@@ es the Commission on the implementation of the program and the various modifications in the ex@@ ecu@@ tions as well as in preparation for future programs and definition of its total understanding , coordin@@ ating and integration of national activities at a joint level in the field of fusion . &quot;
