this document is a summary of the European Public Government report ( EP@@ AR ) in which explains how the Committee on Human@@ istic Studies ( CH@@ MP ) presented to recommendations with regard to the application of the drug .
&quot; if you need more information on your disease or treatment , please read the package of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you would like further information regarding the recommendations of the CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg irrit@@ ated ( tablets that arise in the mouth ) as a solution to take ( 1 mg / ml ) and as inj@@ ection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. Sh@@ res thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or vision of things which are not available ) , mist@@ r@@ ust and mad@@ rig@@ ation ; • Bi@@ polar disorder , in which the patients lack of epis@@ odes ( periods ) altern@@ ating with periods of normal mood . &quot;
&quot; A@@ bili@@ fy becomes the treatment of moderate to severe severe epis@@ odes , and for the prevention of man@@ ic epis@@ odes in patients who have addressed in the past to the medicine used in the past . &quot;
the inj@@ ection solution is applied to the fast control of st@@ aged un@@ rest or behavi@@ ors if the or@@ ale intake of the drug is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution to the one or the mel@@ ting tab@@ let@@ ins are applied to patients with the sc@@ ure of tablets difficulties . &quot;
&quot; patients who are taking other drugs at the same time as A@@ bili@@ fy , the dosage should be adjusted by A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; this affects the signals between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of ner@@ ve cells . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ ecre@@ z@@ ol has probably works mainly as a &quot; partial Ag@@ on@@ ist &quot; for the recep@@ tors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also ser@@ otonin ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in less dimensions than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itters work to activate the recep@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder is a role playing , the activity of the brain contributes to norm@@ alis@@ e , causing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms . &quot;
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent the ren@@ unci@@ ation of symptoms , was investig@@ ated in three studies over up to one year . &quot;
the effectiveness of the inj@@ ection solution was compared in two studies at 805 patients with both schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases that are compared to a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy has been stabili@@ zed on twelve weeks to 347 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo , in which the lack of symptoms were already stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy symptoms . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy inj@@ ection solution was in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered from Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours . &quot;
&quot; in all studies the transformation of the patient has been investig@@ ated using a standard sk@@ ala for bi@@ polar disorder , or the number of patients who spoke to the treatment . &quot;
the company also carried out studies by investig@@ ate how the body is able to take the mel@@ ting tab@@ s and the solution to loc@@ ate ( rising ) .
&quot; in the two studies with the inj@@ ection solution showed patients , the A@@ bili@@ fy in dos@@ es of 5,@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg received a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms . &quot;
the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder reduced A@@ bili@@ fy in four of the five short @-@ term studies of more effective than plac@@ ebo .
A@@ bili@@ fy prev@@ ail@@ ed up to 74 weeks long effective than plac@@ ebo in previously treated patients with previously treated patients and if it was in addition to an existing treatment last .
&quot; A@@ bili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg @-@ cans are also more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms , un@@ rest and were similar effectively like Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extr@@ ap@@ y@@ ram@@ id@@ ale dist@@ urbances ( heart@@ y ) , nerv@@ ousness , sw@@ elling ( heart@@ beat ) , vom@@ iting , nau@@ tical ( heart@@ beat ) , vom@@ iting , nau@@ ght@@ lessness , Insom@@ ni@@ otic . &quot;
the Committee on Human@@ ists ( CH@@ MP ) succe@@ eded in the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and of moderate to severe man@@ ic epis@@ odes associated with Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ Disorder as well as in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who were mostly man@@ ic epis@@ odes in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
&quot; in addition , the Committee came to the result that the benefits of inj@@ ection solution at the fast control of dist@@ urb@@ ing un@@ rest and behavi@@ oral disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic epis@@ odes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if a or@@ ale therapy is not suitable to prev@@ ail over the risks . &quot;
June 2004 the European Commission for the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eu@@ tical Europe Ltd . a licence for the inver@@ t@@ ying of A@@ bili@@ fy in the entire European Union .
AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y is shown to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic epis@@ odes of Bi@@ polar disorder and for prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mostly man@@ ic epis@@ odes associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a reduction dose of 15 mg / day independent of meals .
an increased effectiveness in dos@@ es on a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combinations therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and Bi@@ polar @-@ i@@ - disorder in patients of age 65 years has not been proven .
with regard to the larger sensitivity of this patient group should be considered a lower initi@@ als if clinical factors should justi@@ fy this justi@@ fy ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ duc@@ tor is derived from the combinations therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol dosage should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
the appearance of su@@ icide diseases belongs to psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of a epid@@ emi@@ ological study demonstrated that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there is no elev@@ ated su@@ icide rate with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be used with caution in patients with known cardi@@ ovascular disease , ph@@ uro@@ us disease , hy@@ po@@ etic disorders , hy@@ po@@ emia ( deh@@ ydr@@ ation ) , hy@@ po@@ emia ( deh@@ ydr@@ ation ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ zel@@ eri@@ zed and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical tri@@ m , which one year or less last@@ ed , there were occas@@ i@@ onal reports on during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in@@ loy@@ ed Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ ese . &quot;
if at one with AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y patients treated signs and symptoms of a satur@@ ation dy@@ sk@@ in@@ ese should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment .
&quot; if a patient signs and symptoms developed on a m@@ ns indicate , or un@@ clear high f@@ ever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y , will be set . &quot;
&quot; therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be used in patients with cl@@ amps in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese or in states that are applied with cl@@ amps in connection , with caution . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in patients with psych@@ osis which were associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , an elev@@ ated mort@@ ber@@ is@@ iko compared to the plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; however , in one of these studies , a study with the dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the an@@ ise for un@@ wanted frag@@ rant events with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol patients treated . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emic , in some cases extremely and associated with ket@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em com@@ a or death , was reported in patients with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic medication , including AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y . &quot;
there are no precise risk assessment of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related un@@ wanted events with AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs treated patients who are direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sie , Poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ark@@ y and weak@@ ness ) are observed and patients with diabetes Mell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes Mell@@ itus should be monitor@@ ed regularly with regards to a det@@ eri@@ oration of glu@@ co@@ se values . &quot;
&quot; a weight gain is generally known for schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar al@@ ie due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ dity , the use of anti@@ psych@@ otic medicines , in which weight loss is known as side @-@ effect and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol on the central nervous system , if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective drugs with a superior side effects such as se@@ di@@ mentation ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 @-@ Ant@@ agon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ ine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , whereby this effect is not relevant to clin@@ ically . &quot;
in a clinical trial with healthy promot@@ ers a high effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 in@@ hibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) the Au@@ c of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol around 107 % while the C@@ max remained un@@ changed .
&quot; it is expected to expect other highly effective in@@ hibit@@ ors from CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects and therefore should contain similar dos@@ ing productions . &quot;
with CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) Met@@ abol@@ is@@ ier@@ ers can result the common application with highly effective in@@ hibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ zentr@@ ationen as compared to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ si@@ ven metabol@@ ites .
&quot; if one draws the common gift from K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other high @-@ effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ hibit@@ ors with AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y , the potential benefits should be the potential risks to the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective in@@ hibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HIV @-@ prot@@ eas@@ ed@@ hibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore should contain similar dos@@ ing productions . &quot;
after setting the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 in@@ hibit@@ ors should be the dosage of AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y to be raised from the beginning of the companion therapy .
Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 can be administ@@ ered with AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y , can be calculated with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ ecre@@ z@@ ol@@ - Kon@@ zentr@@ ationen . &quot;
&quot; in clinical tri@@ als , dos@@ es of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol per day does not have significant effect on the met@@ ab@@ olic of the sub@@ str@@ ate of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ ph@@ an / 3 @-@ meth@@ xy@@ morph@@ in@@ an @-@ R@@ atio ) , 2C@@ 19 ( War@@ far@@ tin ) , 2C@@ 19 ( War@@ ep@@ raz@@ ol ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ ph@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should be saved to noti@@ fy their doctor if they are pregnant or maintaining a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
&quot; due to the in@@ sufficient data base for the safety when humans and due to the creation studies in the animal studies , this medicine should not be used in pregnancy , unless the potential benefits clearly justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fo@@ etus . &quot;
&quot; however , in other anti@@ psych@@ otic medication , patients should be war@@ ned , dangerous machines , including power vehicles , to operate , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol on them does not have any negative influence . &quot;
the following side @-@ effects are more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medic@@ ally relevant side effects ( * ) : &quot;
the frequency of the below side effects are defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study group over 52 weeks in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , a total of reduced incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) from EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , Dy@@ ston@@ y and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ ese , compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 57@@ ,@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study group over 26 weeks was the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study group over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14,@@ 8 % in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , and 15.@@ 1 % for patients suffering from O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in therapy . &quot;
man@@ ian epis@@ odes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ Disorder - In a controlled trial over 12 weeks was the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment .
in another study about 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 17.2 % for those under li@@ thium treatment .
in the long time period phase over 26 weeks at a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study was the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for with plac@@ ebo treated patients .
&quot; comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and plac@@ ebo , in which potential changes of rout@@ in@@ ely controlled lab parameters , has been no medic@@ ally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; enh@@ anc@@ ements of the CP@@ K ( Kre@@ atin @-@ Ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally tempor@@ arily and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment patients observed in comparison to 2.0 % of using plac@@ ebo treated patients . &quot;
&quot; reported to the side effects that may occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and above whose appearance was also reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , sp@@ ati@@ c@@ ascular events , and increased mort@@ ality in older dem@@ entia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes Mell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
in clinical tri@@ als and since the market leadership has been un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional ac@@ ute over@@ do@@ ings with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol alone with adult patients with estimated dos@@ es of up to 1260 mg and without deaths .
&quot; although there is no information about the effectiveness of a her@@ modi@@ fying lens , in the treatment of a flo@@ ating with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ; it is un@@ likely that hem@@ at@@ aly@@ tic value is in the treatment of a brid@@ ging of benefits , da Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol features a high plas@@ map@@ le connection . &quot;
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ Disorder via the combination of a particip@@ atory effect on dop@@ amine D2@@ - and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recep@@ tors and a ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recep@@ tors .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ ecre@@ z@@ ol demonstrated in vit@@ ro a high aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D2@@ - and D3 recep@@ tor , as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , for the ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ren@@ ergen and the hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ recep@@ tor . &quot;

in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1.@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol compared to plac@@ ebo a st@@ atis@@ tically significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms .
&quot; in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled study was in week 52 of the proportion of respon@@ dents , which is a call to study medi@@ tate in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values are defined as sec@@ ondary students , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ uph@@ - Dep@@ res@@ sion@@ sr@@ ts scale , showed a significant stronger better than at Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
in a plac@@ ebo controlled trial over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chron@@ ic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia showed himself a significant higher reduction of the down@@ rate that was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol group and 57 % under plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in a O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational @-@ blind @-@ study with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients receive a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the output level ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg at an average weight of approx . 5 kg ) . &quot;
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage about 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ian or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ Disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol a opposite plac@@ ebo affected the effectiveness at reducing chemical symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ Disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol compared to plac@@ ebo no legal effectiveness .
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo@@ - and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ian or mixed episode of a Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which was comparable to plac@@ ebo , which was comparable to the li@@ thium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol pointed out a week 12 a compar@@ ative share of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic Rem@@ ission of Man@@ ia on such as li@@ thium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo controlled study about 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ian or mixed episode of a Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which are partially not reflect on Li@@ thi@@ um@@ - or Val@@ pro@@ at @-@ Mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ ene symptoms , as compared to mon@@ otherapy with li@@ thium or Val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;

&quot; with Ari@@ pi@@ ecre@@ z@@ ol , there are no differences in the pharma@@ co@@ ine@@ tic between male and female healthy pro@@ ban@@ den , as demonstrated in a pharma@@ co@@ operative examination as well as gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
a Populations @-@ specific evaluation of the phar@@ mak@@ oc@@ ine@@ tik has no reference to clin@@ ically significant differences in terms of ethnic affili@@ ation or the effect of the area on the phar@@ mak@@ oc@@ ine@@ tic of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
the pharma@@ co@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ ecre@@ z@@ ol were similar to patients with severe kidney failure .
&quot; a single @-@ bi@@ osis study at Pro@@ ban@@ den with different liver ill@@ ant ( Child @-@ Pug@@ h Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the pharma@@ co@@ generation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , but the study embr@@ ac@@ ed only 3 patients with liver circul@@ ating of class C , which is not enough to attr@@ act conclusions on their met@@ ab@@ olic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on security vulner@@ abilities , tox@@ icity with repeti@@ tive Gab@@ e , Re@@ productions , Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and to can@@ al potential make the pre@@ clinical data not recognis@@ e any particular dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; tox@@ ik@@ ically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ es or expos@@ ures that significantly exce@@ eded the maximum dosage , or exposure while people have significantly exce@@ eded them for the clinical application . &quot;
the effects embr@@ ac@@ ing a dos@@ ing @-@ dependent on @-@ tox@@ icity ( Li@@ po@@ fus@@ cin @-@ Pig@@ ment @-@ accum@@ ulation and / or par@@ ench@@ ym@@ omet@@ ry ) during advice to 104 mg / kg / day ( the 10@@ fold of the middle ste@@ ady @-@ state exposure ) at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10@@ fold of the middle ste@@ ady @-@ state exposure ( Au@@ c ) at the recommended maximum dose when men ) .
&quot; in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis has been established as a result of the cip@@ itation of sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ s of the hydro@@ xy@@ di@@ zz@@ z@@ ol in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeti@@ tive fol@@ ks of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1- to 3@@ fold of the recommended maximum dose when people based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;

&quot; patients with chron@@ ic kidney failure or in patients who have preserved a chem@@ otherapy , should always be in the recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per Dec@@ il@@ ites in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot;
&quot; the appreci@@ ation of all patients are in front of the treatment to ensure that no iron gel is , and iron comp@@ artments should be administ@@ ered during the entire treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who obtain a chem@@ otherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an an@@ emia caused by a ery@@ thro@@ po@@ iet@@ in@@ man@@ gel or by means that the body does not provide sufficient at the body &apos;s own ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin also applied to operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a blood @-@ blood@@ ed .
&quot; it is produced by a cell , into which a gene ( DNA ) was brought to the formation of ep@@ ox@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to as inj@@ ection as inj@@ ection into a V@@ ene in the framework of a major study with 479 people , which is compared to one by kidney problems . &quot;
&quot; all patients participating in this study was at least eight weeks long E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o entered into a v@@ ene inj@@ ected , before they were either submitted to waste amed or continue to E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
main indi@@ ces for the effectiveness was the change of her@@ m@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ es between the beginning of the study and the flight period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
&quot; the company also laid out the results of a study , in which the effects were studied with the ones of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at 114 cancer patients who received a chem@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; in the study with patients , which caused by means caused by kidney problems , the her@@ m@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ es of patients , which were put forward to waste amed as with the those patients who continue to E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to the patients , the further E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o received an increase of 0,0@@ 63 g / dl of the starting point of 12,@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
the most common side @-@ effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure that occasionally lead to symptoms of a encephal@@ opathy ( her@@ n@@ problem@@ e ) such as su@@ dden , st@@ ech@@ ing mig@@ rant , head@@ aches and confusion . &quot;
Ab@@ se@@ amed must not be applied to patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to ep@@ ox@@ et@@ tin @-@ fa or any of the ingredients .
&quot; waste amed as inj@@ ection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that there is no allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ ists ( CH@@ MP ) succe@@ eded in the conclusion that for Ab@@ se@@ amed in accordance with the provisions of the European Union of the evidence was provided that the medicine was a comparable quality , safety and effici@@ encies such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company that represents Ab@@ se@@ amed , will provide for medical professionals in all Member States information packages , including information about the safety of the drug . &quot;

8 In patients with chron@@ ic kidney failure should not be exce@@ eded in the section 4.2 recommended upper limit of the Hä@@ m@@ og@@ lo@@ bin @-@ target concentration .
in clinical studies have been observed an increased Mort@@ ality risk and risk to serious cardi@@ ovascular diseases when Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimul@@ ated agents ( ESA ) with a her@@ m@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ - target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7,5 mm@@ l / l ) .

&quot; according to the present knowledge is not acceler@@ ated by the treatment of an@@ emia with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa in adults with kidney failure , which are not dial@@ ysis . &quot;
&quot; for tum@@ ours patients under chem@@ otherapy , should be considered a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ ox@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ Gab@@ e and the ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etic response to be considered ( patients , which may need to be trans@@ duc@@ ted ) . &quot;
&quot; if the H@@ B @-@ rise is greater than 2 g / dl ( 1,25 m / l ) per month or a H@@ B value of 13 g / dl ( 8.@@ 1 mm@@ ol / l ) , the dosage must be modified according to section 4.2 ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemical agents , balance between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) . &quot;
the decision for the application re@@ combin@@ ative Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a utility risk policy under the involvement of the respective patients who should also take into account the specific clinical context .
&quot; patients who are intended for a larger elek@@ tive orthop@@ edi@@ c procedure , if possible , before the start of the ep@@ ox@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy is the cause of an@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; patients who under@@ take a greater casual orthop@@ edi@@ c procedure , as they should have an increased risk for thro@@ mb@@ otic and v@@ ascular diseases , especially during an underlying cardi@@ ovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , cannot be excluded that in treatment with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa for patients with a starting point of &gt; 13 g / dl a elev@@ ated risk for post@@ operative thro@@ mb@@ or@@ ous events can exist . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled studies have not been proven for ep@@ et@@ ine , that they can improve with tum@@ our patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic an@@ emia or improve the risk of tum@@ or pro@@ gression . &quot;
&quot; 4 months in patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer , who received an chem@@ otherapy , when a her@@ m@@ og@@ lo@@ bin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7,5 - 8,@@ 7 mm@@ ol / l ) &quot;

the most common side @-@ effect during treatment with ep@@ ox@@ tin al@@ fa is a dos@@ ing @-@ dependent rise in blood pressure or the det@@ eri@@ oration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
a increased incidence of thro@@ mb@@ ov@@ ary events ( see section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients under treatment with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine .

the overall survival in the studies could not be explained by the differences in the incidence of thro@@ mb@@ osis and thus related complications in combination with re@@ combin@@ able human@@ oid ery@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin treated patients and with controls s@@ atisfac@@ tor@@ ily .
&quot; there is an elev@@ ated risk for thro@@ wn current events with tum@@ ours , which will be treated with re@@ combin@@ able human@@ oid ery@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin , and a negative effect on the overall survival can not be excluded . &quot;

&quot; in the first study almost 8 000 older women involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and it was investig@@ ated the number of sp@@ inal products and ac@@ fr@@ ac@@ tures over a period of three years . &quot;
the second study embr@@ ac@@ ed 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years which recently suffered a hip ; it was investig@@ ated the number of fr@@ ac@@ tures over a period of up to five years .
&quot; in Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two studies in total 479 patients and compared with ris@@ on@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) . &quot;
Haupt@@ indi@@ k@@ ator for the effectiveness was whether the sal@@ ary of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ are in the ser@@ um ( an enzy@@ me that c@@ ari@@ zing bone building ) in the blood again norm@@ alised or at least 75 % compared to the starting point .
in the study with older women the risk of sp@@ aci@@ dity at patients suffering from A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( without other oste@@ opor@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ kam@@ ente ) over a period of three years compared to the patio under plac@@ ebo by 70 % .
compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ kam@@ ente ) with the those under plac@@ ebo the risk of fr@@ ac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study with men and women shared 9 % of patients suffering from A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a a frei@@ ght ( 92 of 1 065 ) compared to 13 % of patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur in the first three days after the in@@ fusion and are less frequent .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must not be applied to patients who may be over@@ sensi@@ tively ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ l or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the ingredients .

&quot; summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Government report ( EP@@ AR ) , in which explains how the Committee on Human@@ istic research ( CH@@ MP ) , in order to assess recommendations with regard to the application of the drug . &quot;
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type @-@ 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insul@@ in @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can not be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( a di@@ abet@@ es@@ medi@@ k@@ ament ) . • It can be used together with another Di@@ abet@@ es@@ medi@@ k@@ ament ( Du@@ al@@ apy ) .
it can be applied in addition to met@@ form@@ in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) that can be used with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant or insul@@ in can be kept the old dose of sul@@ ate treatment , except for patients with hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia ( hum@@ ane blood sugar ) ; here should be reduced the dose of sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ um disease or insul@@ in . &quot;
&quot; this means that the bodi@@ ly insul@@ in can be better processed and the blood @-@ sugar levels , which can be better easily set to type @-@ 2 diabetes . &quot;
&quot; with more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of Ac@@ tos in Tri@@ ple@@ tion , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant , in addition they received up to 3.5 years either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the studies the concentration of a substance was measured in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ m@@ og@@ lo@@ bin , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) , which is the same as good of the blood sugar . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which can conclude that the blood of the dos@@ es of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg were reduced . &quot;
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ tion therapy showed itself the effect of the extra gift of Ac@@ tos to existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant in a decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % while the extra gift of plac@@ ebo has led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
&quot; in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insul@@ in with 289 patients were examined , the patients who have in addition to insul@@ in , compared to 0.@@ 14 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients who took additional plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were tend@@ encies , infections of the upper resp@@ iratory infection , weight gain and hy@@ po@@ op@@ hobia ( decre@@ ased sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) . &quot;
Ac@@ tos may not be applied to patients with possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) compared to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or one of the other ingredients so still in patients with liver problems , heart failure or di@@ ab@@ etic che@@ on@@ osis - in the blood ) . &quot;
it was decided that Ac@@ tos in the scope of a mon@@ otherapy ( in the sole use ) is intended to serve as an alternative to the default treatment with metal form@@ in in patients where the met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
October 2000 the European Commission for the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited a licence for the inver@@ t@@ ying of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
&quot; the tablets are white until white , round , curved and carry on one side the mark@@ ings &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; and on the other side the cap@@ tion &quot; &quot; AC@@ TOS . &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is also shown to combination with insul@@ in in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar is set up with insul@@ in in@@ adequate and with which met@@ form@@ ality is un@@ suitable ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; for the application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on patients under 18 years , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients , who are at risk at least one risk factor ( e.g. former heart attack or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ are cardi@@ ovascular disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the low@@ est available dose and increase the dosage . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of a heart failure , weight gain or ov@@ aries , especially those with reduced cardi@@ al reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of a heart failure , weight gain , and furn@@ aces when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is used in combination with insul@@ in . &quot;
a cardi@@ ovascular out@@ come study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on patients suffering at 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing metast@@ atic mak@@ ascular disease has been carried out .
&quot; in this study , an increase in the reports about heart failure , which does not lead to an increase in mort@@ ality in the study . &quot;
patients with increased output of liver suffer@@ ers ( AL@@ T &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the North area ) or with other signs of liver disease may not be used to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on .
&quot; if the AL@@ T @-@ mirror is increased to the 3 @-@ fold of the upper limit of the North area , the liver ym@@ ers are as soon as possible again . &quot;
&quot; if a patient symptoms developed to refer to a hep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ solved nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , appe@@ tite , and / or dar@@ ker Har@@ n , are the liver care values . &quot;
the decision whether the treatment of the patient with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on should be continued to advance the laboratory parameters of the clinical assessment .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has been demonstrated a dos@@ ing @-@ dependent weight loss which is connected by fatty deposits and in some cases associated with a hydr@@ ation .
as a result of a her@@ modi@@ lution caused by the therapy with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on a reduced reduction of the middle t@@ amp@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ es ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) .
similar changes have been observed in compar@@ ative controlled studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on for patients under Met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of the h@@ og@@ ue in um 3 @-@ 4 % ) and to a lower extent also in patients under sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant and insul@@ in ( relative reduction of the h@@ og@@ ue to 1 @-@ 2 % ) and the ha@@ emat@@ ok@@ r@@ its around 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a consequence of the increased insul@@ in sensi@@ tiveness in patients , the Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on as oral or three @-@ operation combinations with insul@@ in , the risk of dos@@ ing @-@ dependent hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ tic leu@@ k@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; according to the market leadership , under the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ th@@ indi@@ an , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , including a appearance or det@@ eri@@ oration of a di@@ ab@@ etic Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ dem@@ s with a decre@@ ased of tend@@ encies . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct link between taking Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and the appearance of Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ dem@@ s a direct connection , but sec@@ uring doctors should be aware of the possibility of a Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ dem@@ s ; a proper ophthalm@@ ologist should be considered in consideration . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of messages un@@ wanted events with regard to bone bre@@ ach of random@@ ized , controlled , double fl@@ ashes clinical studies have been treated over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients who were treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on . &quot;
the armed Fra@@ ktur was 1.@@ 9 fr@@ ac@@ tures per 100 patients with the Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated women and 1.1 fr@@ ac@@ tures per 100 patients with women who were treated with a compar@@ ative failure .
&quot; in the Pro@@ active study , a study over 3.5 years to investig@@ ate cardi@@ ovascular events , contra@@ sts fr@@ ac@@ tures of 44 / 870 ( 5.3 % ; 1.0 fac@@ tures per 100 patients ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 fr@@ ac@@ tures per 100 patients ) with patients . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if an patient wishes to be a pregnancy or this one represents , the treatment is shown ( see section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; Studies at the investigation of inter@@ actions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on does not have relevant effects on the pharma@@ co@@ ge@@ tic or pharma@@ co@@ aer@@ odynam@@ ics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ co@@ um@@ on and Met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; inter@@ actions with drugs , which are met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed by these enzy@@ mes , e.g. or@@ ale contrac@@ ep@@ tive , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium , and H@@ MG@@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ ent@@ ones are not expected . &quot;
the simult@@ aneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome m P@@ 450 2@@ C8@@ - In@@ hibit@@ or ) resulting in an increase in the au@@ c of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on around the 3 @-@ fold .
the simult@@ aneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome m P@@ 450 2@@ C8 @-@ In@@ duc@@ tor ) resulting in a reduction of the au@@ c from Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on at 54 % .
&quot; this is due to that treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on which decre@@ ased in pregnancy @-@ standing hyper@@ insul@@ in emia and increased insul@@ in @-@ resistant , and thereby the availability of met@@ ab@@ olic sub@@ str@@ ates for the f@@ og@@ ic growth is decre@@ ased . &quot;
&quot; common &gt; 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 ; &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 ; &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 ; &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 ; &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 ; &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 ; &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 ; &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 ; &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 ; &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 ; &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , acci@@ dents . &quot;
these lead to a tempor@@ arily change of the Tur@@ g@@ ors and the brake index@@ es of the lens as they can be observed in other hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emic effect .
&quot; in clinical studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on tr@@ aten AL@@ T @-@ An@@ tig@@ ating on the tri@@ angles of the norm@@ alities , as frequently as in plac@@ ebo , but more rare than in comparison of met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ye . &quot;
in a Out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing metast@@ atic mak@@ e@@ ascular disease was the frequency of serious her@@ zin@@ er@@ ation under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 1.6 % higher than under plac@@ ebo when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on b@@ p .
&quot; since the launch was rarely reported on Her@@ zin@@ lit@@ az@@ on , but more frequently when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was used in combination with insul@@ in or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; it became an abstr@@ acts analysis of messages un@@ wanted events with regard to bone bre@@ eds out of random@@ ized , controlled , double fl@@ ashes of clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients in the treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated groups and over 7.@@ 400 patients treated with compar@@ ative diagnostic group . &quot;
&quot; over a period of 3,5 years of ongoing Pro@@ active study , fr@@ ying fr@@ ac@@ tures at 44 / 870 ( 5.4 % ) of the patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated patients compared with 23 / 905 ( 2.5 % ) with patients . &quot;
&quot; if taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days occurred no symptoms . &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on seems to have an activation of specific core recep@@ tors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ator pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ator ) .
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduces the glu@@ co@@ production in the liver and the peri@@ ph@@ ere Gluco@@ sever@@ ity in case of insul@@ in @-@ resistant boo@@ sts .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ver@@ sus Gli@@ cla@@ zi@@ d as mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years to investig@@ ate the time until after@@ g@@ low effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ( 8.0 % after the first 6 treatments ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after the treatment of therapy , a blood@@ stream control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on at 69 % of treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under gli@@ cla@@ zi@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ eb@@ ok@@ on@@ tro@@ l@@ ated study about 12 months , patients , their blood vessels in spite of three @-@ mon@@ ati@@ ger optim@@ isation , with insul@@ in in@@ adequate , to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo random@@ ized . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c is reduced by 0.@@ 45 % , compared to the patients who have only received insul@@ in ; a reduction of insul@@ in osi@@ ties treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated group has been observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies over one year showed itself under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , a st@@ atis@@ tically significant reduction of the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ atin@@ in @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ ent compared to the starting points . &quot;
&quot; the effect of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( Mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg ver@@ sus plac@@ ebo ) was checked in a small , on 18 weeks test examination of type @-@ 2 @-@ di@@ ab@@ etics . &quot;
&quot; in most of clinical tri@@ als , compared to plac@@ ebo a reduction of the entire plas@@ ma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as slightly , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL@@ - cholesterol levels . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies over a period of up to two years decre@@ ased Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on compared to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or Gli@@ cla@@ zi@@ de , the overall plas@@ mat@@ ri@@ gly@@ z@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L Cholester@@ in levels . &quot;
&quot; compared to plac@@ ebo , under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was no st@@ atis@@ tically significant increase in L@@ DL Cholester@@ in cholesterol , while Met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cla@@ zi@@ d decre@@ ased values were observed . &quot;
&quot; in a study about 20 weeks decre@@ ased Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on not only the n@@ ets @-@ tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d@@ level , which can also affect the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absor@@ ption as well as the hep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ z@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ active study , a cardi@@ ovascular disease study , 5@@ 238 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced m@@ rov@@ ascular disease in groups random@@ ized who received an existing anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic and cardi@@ ovascular therapy either Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; according to or@@ aler application Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on quickly res@@ or@@ ated , whereby the peak concent@@ rations to un@@ changed Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in plas@@ ma usually reach 2 hours by application . &quot;
&quot; this base corresponds to the validity of M @-@ IV to the effectiveness in about the triple of the effectiveness of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II minimal . &quot;
&quot; in Inter@@ action@@ studies could be det@@ ected that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on the pharma@@ co@@ ge@@ tic or pharma@@ co@@ odynam@@ ics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ co@@ um@@ on and Met@@ form@@ in . &quot;

Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e has been a total of 294 patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes in which the panc@@ re@@ as can produce no insul@@ in and type @-@ 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to use the insul@@ in effectively .
&quot; in the study after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ fied Hä@@ m@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) is measured , which is part of the blood sugar . &quot;
Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e led to a decl@@ ine of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c Spi@@ eg@@ els that pointed out that the blood sugar is similar to a different human@@ insul@@ in .
Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e should not be applied to patients who may possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Human@@ insul@@ in ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the dos@@ es of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e could possibly be adapted when it comes along with a number of other drugs that can affect the blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found ) . &quot;
the Committee on Human@@ ists ( CH@@ MP ) succe@@ eded in the conclusion that the benefits of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e in the treatment of diabetes compared to the risks .
October 2002 the European Commission adopted by the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S approval for inver@@ t@@ ap@@ han@@ e throughout the European Union .
mixed insul@@ in products are usually used once or twice daily if a quick initi@@ ate effect will be desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the inj@@ ection sk@@ ull must be rank@@ ed at least 6 seconds long under the skin to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .

&quot; if changing to Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e in the patient is required , it can be necessary during the first dos@@ ing or in the first weeks or months after conversion . &quot;
&quot; some patients , in which hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emic reactions to a change of animal in human insul@@ in occurred , reported that the early War@@ n@@ oth@@ s of a hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia is less characterized or different from their prec@@ eding insul@@ in . &quot;

&quot; when the ur@@ inary stand@@ ings after two to four weeks is still over 6 mg a discreet , the dose may be raised up to 120 mg once every day . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment of treatment , the patients may still occur with tox@@ ic acci@@ dents , therefore , that patients may have taken at least during the first six months in treatment with A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic . &quot;
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ@@ tran@@ splantation as it was not examined for these groups .
&quot; in the first study , at the 1 0@@ 72 patients distributed , the effectiveness of a different A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ es ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) with the one plac@@ ebo ( head@@ quarter ) and from Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine used to treat hyper@@ qu@@ ic@@ emia ) . &quot;
in the second study two dos@@ es were compared to two dos@@ es of A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) one year long to 762 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
&quot; in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg a day . &quot;
main indi@@ ces for the effectiveness was the number of patients that lay their ur@@ ic acid in the blood at the last three measurements under 6 mg / dl .
&quot; in the first study 48 % ( 126 from 262 ) of patients , the A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic in a dosage of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients , which once taken once every day 120 mg , in the last three measurements of a urea in the blood of below 6 mg / dl . &quot;
in comparison with 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) patients suffering from Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of 134 patients taking plac@@ ebo .
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , nau@@ sea , nau@@ sea and normal liver values . &quot;
&quot; especially in patients with cardi@@ ac disease , possibly an increased risk of certain side effects , which concern the heart and the blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ ists ( CH@@ MP ) succe@@ eded in the conclusion that A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic acid in the blood was more effective than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and the blood vessels . &quot;

the data collected in two years of the open extension study in phase 3 showed that the permanent ste@@ ering of ser@@ um di@@ so@@ bri@@ cks in &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) has needed a withdrawal of incidence over the months 16 @-@ 24 a treatment against a cardboard cell ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed ) .
&quot; this was associated with a reduction of tox@@ ic size , resulting in 54 % of patients a complete dis@@ appearance of the gi@@ vers to month 24 . &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also received in patients who received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ period studies ( see section 4.4 ) .

&quot; the patient has to take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or take other medicines ( including an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vit@@ amine ) . &quot;
&quot; to avoid a irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient is to take place until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the ear@@ liest thirty minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D3 are already used separately in medic@@ inal products that are approved in the European Union , the company placed data from earlier studies and the published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study with 35 men and 682 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to pro@@ pose the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE in relation to the increase of vitamin D mirr@@ ors .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment the proportion of patients with low vitamin D @-@ mirror were treated with the patients who were treated with AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE ( 11 % ) than with those who took exclusively al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also put data in front of the data that the included in AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is exactly the dose that is required for the prevention of a bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain , bones , or joints ) and symptoms of the diges@@ tion appar@@ atus , Dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sie ( diges@@ tion ) , co@@ incidence , dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia ( di@@ arr@@ ative ) , flu@@ c@@ ency , dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia ( swal@@ low abdom@@ en ) as well as acid v@@ eins . &quot;
&quot; with patients with any over@@ sensitivity ( all@@ ergy ) against al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , vitamin D3 , or any of the other components must not be applied to AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE . &quot;
&quot; it may not be applied to diseases of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hy@@ po@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( s@@ light calcium levels ) or in patients that cannot stand up at least 30 minutes . &quot;

AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is only possible with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , bever@@ age or imp@@ orts of drugs ( including an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vit@@ amine ) for the day . &quot;
the following hin@@ ts are exactly to follow to reduce the risk of mal@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
&quot; • AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE shall be swallow@@ ed according to the age of the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not leave the tablet or tablet in the mouth , as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a . • The patients should not take place before the first for@@ es@@ tion of the day , at the ear@@ liest thirty minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; B. pep@@ cid Ul@@ kus , active gast@@ ro@@ intestinal ble@@ eding or surgical procedures in the upper Gastro@@ intestinal confusion except P@@ yl@@ or@@ oplast@@ y , only under special caution ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; Ecological reactions , such as Ö@@ tz@@ agi@@ tis , ös@@ oph@@ age@@ ale Ul@@ zer@@ a and ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al ro@@ gen@@ es , were reported in patients under the intake of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( sometimes these tou@@ ches and required a nur@@ series ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore be attentive to all signs and symptoms which should be pointed to any mal@@ oph@@ age@@ ous reactions , and the patients shall be pointed out to the occurr@@ ence of symptoms , or retro@@ sp@@ inal pain , or new or to push for medical advice and medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;

it is very important that all the dos@@ ing of the patients will be passed on to the patient and to be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; while in large ex@@ haus@@ tive clinical studies have been established with al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no increased risk , rarely ( according to market leadership ) stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , including some severe and with complications , reports ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;

dos@@ ing recommendations - Nu@@ t convey@@ or proph@@ y@@ lax@@ is of tran@@ splan@@ t Adv@@ ant@@ is The or@@ al Adv@@ ant@@ ra@@ f therapy should start with 0.20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily for@@ ks in the morning .
further dosage can be required later as the phar@@ mak@@ oc@@ ine@@ tic of t@@ acro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of stabili@@ zation of patients after tran@@ splantation .
dos@@ si@@ eves / tran@@ splan@@ t proph@@ y@@ lax@@ is of the tran@@ splan@@ t Adv@@ ant@@ al therapy should begin with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as a daily for@@ ks in the morning .
dosage Recomm@@ end@@ ation - Mig@@ rating from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f must be implemented a tran@@ splan@@ t capsules of twice daily intake of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules on a once daily intake of adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f to take place in proportion of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) to be carried out on the entire day@@ time dose .
kidney and liver tran@@ splan@@ t after a conversion of other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ va at Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f once daily needs to start treatment with each in kid@@ neys and liver tran@@ splantation for the proph@@ y@@ lax@@ is of tran@@ splan@@ ts .
&quot; heart@@ tran@@ splantation With adult patients , which are inser@@ ted on Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , is an or@@ ale initi@@ als of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day daily once a day . &quot;
&quot; other tran@@ splan@@ ts , though there are no clinical experience with Adv@@ ant@@ ra@@ f at l@@ amm@@ - , p@@ ank@@ ech@@ - and dar@@ m@@ ble splan@@ ts patients in a or@@ ral Initi@@ al osis of 0.2 mg / kg / day and at intestinal tran@@ splan@@ ts in a or@@ al initi@@ ator of 0,@@ 3 mg / kg / day to application . &quot;
dos@@ es adap@@ tations in special patients with reduced liver function for maintenance of blood subjects in the ang@@ reb@@ ate area can be required in patients with severe liver disorders .
patients with reduced kidney function Da the kidney function has no influence on the pharma@@ co@@ sis of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus can be trig@@ ger@@ ed that a dosage is not required .
&quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus , however , a careful monitoring of the kidney function ( including regular determination of the ser@@ um cre@@ atine , is recommended by the calculation of the cre@@ atin@@ inc@@ in@@ ance and supervision of the ure@@ ter ) . &quot;
conversion of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f At the conversion of a Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ - on a T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy is caution ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations to Tal@@ ks in full blo@@ ody The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of waste @-@ value and compatibility at the individual @-@ level of full @-@ blo@@ ody @-@ t@@ acro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ ks @-@ controls .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the t@@ acro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ ks during the first two weeks of tran@@ splantation followed by peri@@ odic controls during educational therapy .
&quot; blood levels of t@@ acro@@ li@@ mus should also change to conversion of Pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , dos@@ is@@ customiz@@ ing , changes to immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or with simult@@ aneous use of substances which may change the t@@ acro@@ li@@ mus @-@ full concentration , ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is a medicine with a low clear@@ ance , adjust@@ ments may need several days until the ste@@ ady State is entering . &quot;
the data in clinical studies make it possible that a successful treatment in most cases is possible when the slow@@ ing in the blood 20 ng / ml do not exc@@ eed .
in clinical practice lie the Tal@@ ks of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus in full blo@@ ody in the first time after liver tran@@ splan@@ ts usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and with kid@@ neys - and ru@@ tran@@ splan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
&quot; during the subsequent treatment therapy of liver , kidney , and cardi@@ ac splan@@ ts were usually used ble@@ eding in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious un@@ wanted events , including tran@@ splan@@ ts or other side effects , which can occur in a result of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus Unter@@ - or over@@ ex@@ position . &quot;
patients should always keep the same T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus form@@ ulation and the corresponding daily dosage should be done only under the tight@@ ening control of one in the tran@@ splantation experienced physi@@ cian ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .

proph@@ y@@ lax@@ is of the tran@@ splan@@ t of the tran@@ splan@@ ts in adult tran@@ splan@@ ts and tran@@ splan@@ ts are still no clinical data for the recur@@ ded wor@@ ding Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f .
&quot; due to possible inter@@ actions , which can lead to a reduction of the t@@ acro@@ li@@ mus in the blood and a weak@@ ening of clinical tri@@ als ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ation ) , or other plant drugs during a treatment with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with di@@ arr@@ h@@ ö is a particularly careful monitoring of the t@@ acro@@ li@@ mus@@ - concent@@ rations in the blood , since the t@@ acro@@ li@@ mus @-@ blood@@ mirror may be subj@@ ected in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f , was reported as Kar@@ di@@ omy@@ opath@@ ic chamber or se@@ pt@@ ow@@ able hyper@@ trop@@ hy , which can therefore also be used under Adv@@ ant@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; further factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders , a treatment with cor@@ tico@@ ster@@ oids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver disorders , infection , fluid @-@ load and eco @-@ load . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive , the exposure of sun@@ light or UV @-@ light should be restricted due to appropriate clothing or use of a screen by using a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; patients who are taking the her@@ acro@@ li@@ m , symptoms for PRE@@ S such as head@@ aches , changing level of consciousness , scrat@@ ches and vision should show a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g . &quot;

the simult@@ aneous use of drugs or herbal remedies which are known as in@@ hibit@@ ors or in@@ duc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can increase the metabolism of t@@ acro@@ li@@ m and thus reduce the blood values of t@@ acro@@ li@@ m .
it is therefore advised to change the t@@ acro@@ li@@ vi@@ - blood levels in simult@@ aneous gifts of substances which can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism to maintain equal concent@@ rations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
&quot; a strongly pron@@ ounc@@ ed inter@@ play with an@@ tim@@ y@@ k@@ ica like k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , i@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and Vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole , as well as with the Macro@@ lid anti@@ biotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV @-@ prot@@ eas@@ ers ( z . &quot;

&quot; since T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus can set up the cle@@ ans@@ ance of ster@@ oid @-@ contra@@ sts , and thus the hormone ex@@ position can increase in decisions about recep@@ tive policies . &quot;
the results of animal experim@@ ents showed that T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus pot@@ entially decrease the clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ on and can extend their half @-@ value .

&quot; advoc@@ ate is similar to another in the European Union called Re@@ dul@@ ate , but is similar , however , so that the medicine has no prot@@ otypes or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies in patients with severe and moderate op@@ hili@@ a A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was investig@@ ated by the prevention of ble@@ eding , as well as in surgical procedure . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the effectiveness of advoc@@ ate was rated in the prevention of ble@@ eding in 86 % of 510 new blood @-@ pis@@ odes associated with &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of advoc@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are Sch@@ win@@ del , head@@ aches , Py@@ rex@@ ie ( Fi@@ eber ) and the formation of antibodies to factor VIII . &quot;

&quot; after the CH@@ MP the answers to the company was checked on the questions , were still some questions un@@ solved . &quot;
based on the testing of initial submitted documents created the CH@@ MP to day 120 a list of issues that sent to the company .
the CH@@ MP opinion was not suffici@@ ently proved that the inj@@ ection of adv@@ ancement in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ tum@@ ours benefits for patients .
&quot; the committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug in the body , the type of de@@ preci@@ ation as well as the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not suffici@@ ently proved that adv@@ exin can be produced in reliable ways and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who are in close contact with patients . &quot;
the company translated the CH@@ MP did not know whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who currently part in clinical tri@@ als or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ance .
&quot; changed activity &quot; means that the tablets are so composite , that one of the effective components immediately and the other slowly is released over several hours . &quot;
aer@@ ina@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of the seas@@ onal rhin@@ itis ( hy@@ s ) caused by all@@ ergy against pol@@ len ur@@ ged in@@ flammation of the nas@@ al paths ) in patients with nas@@ al g@@ lows ( hide nose ) .
for adults and young people from 12 years the recommended dose of aer@@ ina@@ ze twice daily a tablet that should be taken entirely with a glass of water or without food .
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ended as soon as the symptoms , above all the sw@@ elling of the Nas@@ ensch@@ lei@@ m@@ haut ( block@@ ed nose ) . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be trac@@ ed to the con@@ stip@@ ation of the nose .
the main objective dimensions were the changes of the sever@@ ity of the hay@@ stack of the hy@@ ac@@ ular symptoms that reported by the patients before the start of treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the trial the patients carried their symptoms all 12 hours into a diary and rated with a standard sk@@ ala , how heavy the symptoms in the last 12 hours were . &quot;
&quot; when ob@@ struction of all the bra@@ ve symptoms than the con@@ stip@@ ation of the nose reported the patients who took the aer@@ ation of symptoms around 46.@@ 0 % , compared with 35,@@ 9 % in patients , the p@@ seud@@ o@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone in alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al membran@@ e was considered , the patients showed under Aer@@ ina@@ ze a lin@@ ing of symptoms by 37.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients , the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aer@@ ina@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are od@@ ach@@ ability , vi@@ tic@@ ular hyper@@ activity , an@@ chor@@ age , psych@@ otherapy , fatigue , Insom@@ ni@@ pot@@ ency , fatigue , bra@@ in@@ eness , fatigue and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ yth@@ ts may be used in patients who may not be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , p@@ seud@@ o@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or any of the other ingredients , against ad@@ ren@@ erge agents or Lor@@ at@@ adin ( another medicine used to treat allergi@@ es ) are not applied . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ yth@@ ts may also not be applied to patients who suffer from a fr@@ end@@ y ( hyper@@ tension ) , cardi@@ ac disease ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ ose ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ ose ( hyper@@ tension ) or already have a risk for hem@@ or@@ rh@@ etor@@ ic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission adopted by the company SP Europe a licence for the inver@@ t@@ ying Aer@@ ina@@ ze in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , is in a whole to swal@@ low ( i.e. without them to cr@@ ashing or ch@@ ew ) . &quot;
Aer@@ ina@@ ze should not be applied due to the failure of data to im@@ per@@ sever@@ ance and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) not for children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms of the symptoms .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the time of use on 10 days , as in long @-@ term application the activity of p@@ seud@@ o@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine can decrease in time with the time . &quot;
&quot; after decl@@ ine the sw@@ elling of the mu@@ co@@ us membran@@ es in the upper breath , the treatment can be continued with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; since Aer@@ ina@@ ze p@@ seud@@ o@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine contains , the medicine is also con@@ ce@@ aled in patients who are treated with a mon@@ o@@ am@@ ino@@ x@@ id@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) in@@ hibit@@ ors or within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the alph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of p@@ seud@@ o@@ eph@@ ones , such as Bro@@ mo@@ crip@@ i@@ tin , Per@@ go@@ id , Cab@@ erg@@ ol@@ in , Er@@ go@@ id , Cab@@ erg@@ ol@@ ine , Phen@@ yl@@ phen@@ ot@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , Nap@@ met@@ ol@@ in , Nap@@ haz@@ ol@@ in , Nap@@ haz@@ ol@@ ine etc . ) . &quot;
the safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient @-@ reflection and the data is not sufficient to speak for appropriate recommendations for dosage .
the safety and effectiveness of aer@@ os@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver disorder and the data are not sufficient to observe the recommendations for dosage .
patients must be informed about that the treatment of occurr@@ ence of hyper@@ tension or a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ mic or by pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardi@@ ac arr@@ hyth@@ mia , nau@@ sea or any other neurolog@@ ical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or strengthening of head@@ aches ) . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of the following patient groups , patients suffering from digit@@ alis patients with cardi@@ ovascular disease patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with a m@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ inf@@ arkt in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , blad@@ der , blad@@ der , or bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ mus in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
Aer@@ ina@@ ze is at least 48 hours before performing dermat@@ olog@@ ischer tests that anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka otherwise can prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin re@@ productions or reduce to their extent .
&quot; as part of clinical ex@@ ams with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , where Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole additionally got administ@@ ered , however , have not been observed any clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions or changes of plastic concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; with the results of psych@@ ological tests could not be reported significant differences between the use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and with plac@@ ebo treated patients , regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone or with alcohol was taken . &quot;
this is not identified for the met@@ ab@@ olic of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin enzy@@ me was not yet identified so that inter@@ actions with other drugs cannot be excluded completely .
&quot; Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in@@ fr@@ amed in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not , and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ studies have shown that the drug is not in@@ hibit@@ ing CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and neither a sub@@ str@@ ate nor in@@ hibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ co@@ se . &quot;
&quot; however , the im@@ per@@ sever@@ ance of the use of aerob@@ ics during pregnancy is not assured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ anci@@ es , however no increase in frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the Nor@@ mal population . &quot;
as a re@@ productive studies of animals do not always be transmitted to man and due to vas@@ o@@ on@@ stri@@ ial properties of p@@ seud@@ o@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine should not be applied to the pregnancy .
&quot; however , the patients should be solved in very rare cases to a ben@@ om@@ ous cases that can lead to an imp@@ air@@ ment of transportation or the capacity to the operator of machines . &quot;
&quot; Symptoms may vary between a Z@@ NS Depression ( se@@ di@@ ment , Ap@@ nea , ver@@ min@@ ated spiritual attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , com@@ a , cardi@@ ovascular , stair@@ case ) and a Z@@ NS @-@ sti@@ m@@ ulation , Tre@@ ble , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tu@@ als . &quot;

in controlled clinical tri@@ als was established in a recommended dose of 5 mg a daily basis of slots in comparison to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; the or@@ al application of p@@ seud@@ o@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can produce other sympath@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ dia or manifest@@ ations of a Z@@ NS arous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it took about 1.@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seas@@ onal rhin@@ itis , with the 414 patients of aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies the hist@@ amine effectiveness of aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets , determined by the total scor@@ es for symptoms ( except nas@@ al path@@ ology ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ seud@@ o@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets with regard to the remote effect , determin@@ ing based on the nas@@ al @-@ skin @-@ skin , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin through the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;

A@@ eri@@ us was investig@@ ated in a total eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and young people with allergic rhin@@ itis ( including four studies at seas@@ onal rhin@@ itis and two studies in patients who also had as@@ thma ) .
&quot; the effectiveness en@@ sured by changing the symptoms ( it@@ ch , number and size of the squares , imp@@ air@@ ment of the sleep , and the performance of the day ) before and after six@@ teenth treatment was determined . &quot;
&quot; other studies were submitted to medi@@ tate that the body will take the sy@@ rup , the solution to take and the mel@@ ting tab@@ let@@ ins in the same way as the tablets and the application with children is harm@@ less . &quot;
&quot; in allergic rhin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were generated , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us to an average amount of symptoms ( symptoms ) rose 25 to 32 % , compared to the acceptance of 12 to 26 % in the patients who received a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
in the two studies at Ur@@ tik@@ aria frau@@ d frau@@ d the withdrawal of symptoms with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared with 40 and 33 % compared with plac@@ ebo treated patients .
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us should not be applied to patients , which may possibly be over@@ sensi@@ tively ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , Lor@@ at@@ adin , or any of the ingredients . &quot;

&quot; one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms in allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ acting and Persian rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there is limited experience from clinical studies at the effectiveness of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin for young people from 12 to 17 years ( see sections of 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of inter@@ til@@ ting allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be taken according to the previous disease and may be taken after the sound of the symptoms and can be taken back in their res@@ ign@@ ation .

clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not established in the framework of clinical studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin tablets were not established in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole additionally got administ@@ ered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clin@@ ically @-@ pharma@@ cological study was not increased by A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol the high @-@ performance effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; however , the patients should be informed about it that it can be in very rare cases to bl@@ iss , which can lead to an imp@@ air@@ ment of transportation or the capacity to the operator of machines . &quot;
&quot; at clinical studies in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chron@@ ic idi@@ opath@@ ic re@@ tik@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us as in patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; most of the most common side effects , which was reported more frequently than with plac@@ ebo , fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , mouth@@ wash ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with 578 youth@@ ful patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side @-@ effect head@@ aches , that occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of patients with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and were treated with 6,@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ branch study , in which up to 45 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nine Clinical dose ) have been observed , have been observed not clin@@ ically relevant effects . &quot;
&quot; this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ in@@ flam@@ mat@@ ory cy@@ tok@@ ines like IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human masturbation / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es one as well as the in@@ hibition of expression of the Ad@@ j@@ ul@@ ls . &quot;

&quot; in a clin@@ ically @-@ pharma@@ cological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) over ten days has been adopted , showed no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; with an individual dos@@ si@@ - study with adults showed Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg has no influence on standard measuring sizes , including the strengthening of subj@@ ective sl@@ es@@ tion or the tasks that are connected to the fly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis was A@@ eri@@ us effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating the symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , Nas@@ en@@ secre@@ tion and Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z the nose , it@@ ary flow , and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ enni@@ al , may be allergic to rhin@@ itis in dependence on the duration of symptoms or even in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and Persian rhin@@ itis . &quot;
interval rhin@@ itis is defined as occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
Persian rhin@@ itis is defined as occurr@@ ence of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as the basis of the total scor@@ es of the question@@ na@@ ire to the quality of life at Rh@@ ino @-@ Con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis was demonstrated , decre@@ ased A@@ eri@@ us effectively caused by seas@@ onal rhin@@ itis . &quot;
the chron@@ ic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tik@@ aria was investig@@ ated as the underlying path@@ op@@ hysi@@ ology because the underlying path@@ op@@ hysi@@ ology is similar to equi@@ valence in various forms and chron@@ ic patients can be easier to pro@@ spek@@ tive .
&quot; as the Hist@@ amine is a vital factor in all of ancest@@ ral diseases , is expected that des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is also acknowled@@ ged among other forms of the urine test to improve the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chron@@ ic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tik@@ aria was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the her@@ ence of size and number of squares at the end of the first dos@@ es inter@@ v@@ alls .

an improvement of the it@@ ching more than 50 % was treated with 55 % of the patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin patients compared to 19 % of using plac@@ ebo treated patients .
the treatment with ap@@ eri@@ us reduced the dist@@ urb@@ ance of sleep and the growth considerably as determined by a 4 @-@ points scale to evaluate this variable .
&quot; in a phar@@ yn@@ ge@@ tic study , in which the patients @-@ dem@@ ograp@@ hies with the general seas@@ onal rhin@@ itis was comparable , was achieved at 4 % of patients a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
there are no stop points for a clin@@ ically relevant re@@ ulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days before .
&quot; however , this is not identified for the met@@ ab@@ olic of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin enzy@@ me however not identified so that inter@@ actions with other drugs cannot be excluded completely . &quot;
&quot; Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in@@ fr@@ amed in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ studies have shown that the drug is not in@@ hibit@@ ing CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and neither a sub@@ str@@ ate nor in@@ hibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ co@@ se . &quot;

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken regardless of meals to alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms in allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ acting and pers@@ ist rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rhin@@ itis is caused by children under 2 years by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data are pre@@ valent in the treatment of a inf@@ ectious rhin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper breathing infections , or anatom@@ ical an@@ om@@ al@@ ies should play a role in the diagnosis of an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical investig@@ ations and corresponding labor@@ ers and skin exam@@ inations . &quot;
around 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years met@@ ab@@ oli@@ ze Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is restricted and experienced a higher sub @-@ load ( see under section 5.2 ) .

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s Vac@@ cines and Diagnos@@ tics S.r.@@ l . the Committee on Human@@ istic nei@@ medium ( CH@@ MP ) officially launched that the company takes his application to approval of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and older men .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be caused by adults and el@@ derly people to protect flu that is caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of influ@@ enza @-@ A @-@ Virus .
&quot; this is a special type of vaccine , which could cause in front of a trunk of Gri@@ pp@@ e@@ virus that may cause an future p@@ and@@ emic . &quot;
&quot; a Gri@@ pp@@ ep@@ and@@ emic breaks off when a new trunk of wrath is emerging , which can easily spread from man to man because the people still have no imm@@ unity ( no protection ) . &quot;
&quot; according to the vaccine of the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the immune system contained in the vaccine contained parts of Gri@@ pp@@ e@@ virus as &quot; &quot; physical &quot; &quot; and is antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; thus , the immune system was later able to form in contact with a Gri@@ pp@@ e@@ virus this tribe . &quot;
&quot; subsequently the membran@@ e covering of the virus with the &quot; Ober@@ flächen@@ anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membran@@ e surface , which recogni@@ zes the human body as a physical body ) and used as an integral part of the vaccine . &quot;
the inspection of some of the study centers showed that the study was not performed according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; thus , the scope of clinical data base is not based on the evaluation of the security of the vaccine in order to meet the requirements of the guidelines of the E@@ ME@@ A for pre@@ datory vac@@ cines . &quot;
should you take part in a clinical test and require further information on your treatment please contact your treatment doctor .
&quot; if you would like further information regarding the recommendations of the CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is applied in combination with other anti@@ vi@@ ral pharmaceutical drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with human immun@@ iz@@ che@@ virus from type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which are the acquired immun@@ iz@@ ing ficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who can not swal@@ low the capsules as a solution to take , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r since the security of this combination was not examined . &quot;
&quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should only be attri@@ buted when the doctor has checked , which anti@@ vi@@ ral drug has had previously taken , and the pro@@ bability ass@@ essed that the virus is based on the medic@@ inal medicine . &quot;
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily associated with twice a day 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ vi@@ ral medicines .
for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg is the recommended dose of as@@ gener@@ ating after body weight .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase reduces taking it in combination with other anti@@ vi@@ ral medicines , the HIV quantity in the blood and keeps them at low level . &quot;
&quot; AIDS not to he@@ al , however , the damage of the immune system can also delay the development of associated infections and disorders . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in combination with other anti@@ vi@@ ral medicines , but without rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with the 736 HIV @-@ infected adults who were previously treated with prot@@ eas@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; with low @-@ si@@ zed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r rein@@ forced medicine A@@ gener@@ ase has been taken at 206 adult , which used to be previously made prot@@ eas@@ e@@ wor@@ ms , with other prot@@ eas@@ ers . &quot;
Haupt@@ indi@@ k@@ ator for the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ected concent@@ rations of HIV in the blood ( Vir@@ us@@ last ) or the change in Vir@@ us@@ last after treatment .
&quot; in studies with patients who previously had no prot@@ eas@@ e@@ wor@@ ms later , after 48 weeks , more patients had a vi@@ ral minimum under 400 copies / ml than under plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase has been less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also has been the Vir@@ us@@ last but with the children who were treated earlier with prot@@ eas@@ ers earlier , only very few on the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults , who were treated earlier with prot@@ eas@@ ers , that with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r rein@@ forced medicine A@@ gener@@ ase the Vir@@ us@@ last after 16 @-@ week treatment as effectively as other prot@@ eas@@ e@@ wor@@ ms : &quot;
&quot; with the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ eas@@ e@@ wor@@ ms , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of the Vir@@ us@@ last after four weeks as with the patients who have previously continued their previous prot@@ eas@@ e@@ wor@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ) , Flat@@ r@@ ency ( blocks ) , vom@@ iting , r@@ ash , and Fatigue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied to patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r or any of the ingredients .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ asis can also be applied to patients , the cur@@ rant ( a herbal supplements to treat depression ) or drugs , which are just like A@@ gener@@ ase and are harmful in high concent@@ rations in the blood health . &quot;
&quot; as for other drugs against HIV consists of patients who are taking as@@ gener@@ ative , the risk of a Li@@ po@@ dy@@ st@@ roph@@ y ( changes in the distribution of the body group ) , a oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( symptoms of bone tissue ) or of an immun@@ iz@@ ec@@ tivi@@ ties@@ syndrome ( symptoms of an infection , which are caused by a re@@ covering immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee on Human@@ ists ( CH@@ MP ) succe@@ eded in the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ are used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral medicines to treat patients with prot@@ eas@@ ers previously treated HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharma@@ cological amplifier vol@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee set firmly that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase has taken in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously did not have prot@@ eas@@ e@@ wor@@ ms . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; because at the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information .
October 2000 approved the European Commission for G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited responsible for the frei@@ ght of A@@ gener@@ ase in the entire European Union .
A@@ gener@@ asis is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1- infected , Prot@@ eas@@ eri@@ mer ( PI ) @-@ treated adults and children older than 4 years . &quot;
&quot; for usually , as@@ gener@@ ase capsules to the pharma@@ co@@ sis @-@ master@@ y of Amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r performed together with low dos@@ es of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual vir@@ al resistance of the patient and the pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ avail@@ abil@@ ty of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take up to 14 % lower than one of Amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r as cap@@ sel ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ s are not inter@@ change@@ able ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg Amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral medicines .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ s without the rein@@ forced addition of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ding ) must be applied to higher dos@@ es ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral medicines to become a daily dose of 2400 mg ampli@@ avi@@ r that should not be exce@@ eded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the phar@@ mak@@ oc@@ ine@@ tic , effectiveness and safety of as@@ gener@@ ating in combination with low dos@@ es of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ eas@@ ers were not examined in children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for the application in children under 4 years , due to the failure of data to im@@ per@@ sever@@ ance and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
based on pharma@@ co@@ ine@@ tic data should be the dose of as@@ gener@@ ative capsules in adult patients with medium @-@ wei@@ ght@@ ered liver disorder on 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver disorders to 300 mg twice daily .
the simult@@ aneous use should be done in patients with light or moderate liver disorder with caution in patients with severe liver disorder ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase should not be given simultaneously with medication that have a small therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates of Cy@@ to@@ chro@@ m P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
&quot; herbal supplements , the cur@@ se ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) included , may not be used because of the risk reduction in the risk of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r during taking amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r during the intake of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
patients should be pointed out that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral therapy does not lead to cure HIV infection and that they continue to develop opport@@ un@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral therapy including treatment with as@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transmission of HIV on others through sexual contact or cont@@ amination with blood .
&quot; usually , as@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be used together with low dos@@ es of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients who are suffering to chron@@ ic hep@@ atitis B or C and with anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral combination therapy , have an elev@@ ated risk for heavy living @-@ effects with pot@@ entially fatal course . &quot;
&quot; for the event of simult@@ aneous anti@@ vi@@ ral treatment of hep@@ atitis B or C , please read the information concerning this medicine . &quot;
patients with pre @-@ existing liver function including a chron@@ ic @-@ active hep@@ atitis show an increased frequency of liver disorders under anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral combinations and should be monitor@@ ed according to clinical practice .
&quot; the simult@@ aneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on or other glu@@ co@@ ok@@ or@@ rho@@ ids , which is not recommended by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , it is not recommended that the possible benefits of treatment is the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ tico@@ ster@@ oid of effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the benefits function ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the altern@@ ation of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t @-@ shirt Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended by the increased risk of My@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ ysis . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some drugs , which can cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects such as Carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ in , t@@ ric@@ y@@ cli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring of the International standardi@@ zation R@@ atio ) , are methods for determination of the active concentration . &quot;
&quot; in patients who take this medicine at the same time , as@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective because of the less plastic pipe of Amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r . ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; because of the possibility of met@@ ab@@ olic inter@@ actions with Amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tive may be changed , but the information is not sufficient to appreciate the type of inter@@ actions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitor@@ ed on opal@@ esc@@ ary symptoms , in particular if there are still low dos@@ es of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
due to the possible risk of tox@@ icity due to the high prop@@ ylene gly@@ col@@ lateral solution to the one is this lo@@ wer@@ ing form for children under an age of four years of age @-@ pe@@ eled and should be applied with regard to certain other patient groups .
A@@ generic should be set on duration 5 if a r@@ ash of system@@ ic or allergic symptoms are accompanied or the mu@@ co@@ us membran@@ e ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral therapy including prot@@ ocol@@ s , has been reported on the appearance of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an ex@@ ac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases which were required to their therapy medicines which were associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emic .
&quot; B. higher age , and with medication @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral treatment and the associated met@@ ab@@ olic disorders , associated . &quot;
&quot; with hem@@ m@@ op@@ hil@@ en patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ eas@@ ers , reports are reported on an increase in ble@@ eding including spontaneous co@@ uns@@ ellor hem@@ at@@ oms and ha@@ ff@@ thro@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; with HIV @-@ infected patients with serious immun@@ og@@ ral therapy ( ART ) can develop an anti @-@ retro@@ vi@@ ral combination therapy ( ART ) such a anti @-@ anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral or res@@ i@@ du@@ ale opport@@ un@@ istic infections , which leads to serious clinical tri@@ als or det@@ eri@@ oration of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a multi@@ fac@@ torial simil@@ arities is accepted ( including application of cor@@ tico@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , higher Body @-@ Mass Index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose especially in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ate with low therapeu@@ tical width A@@ gener@@ ase should not be given simultaneously with medication that have a small therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates of cy@@ to@@ chro@@ m P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ sub@@ str@@ ates with small therapeu@@ tical width A@@ generic with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be conf@@ used together with drugs whose agents are mainly connected to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and for the increased plas@@ mas@@ al side effects associated with severe and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in a 82 % reduction in the Au@@ c is caused by amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r that can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and can result in a resistance .
the attempt to balance the low@@ ed plastic man@@ sion through a dos@@ ing increase of other prot@@ ease in@@ hibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r devices have been observed very often un@@ wanted effects on the liver .
cur@@ ator ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The Ser@@ um level of Amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r can be found by the simult@@ aneous application of herbal supplements ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient takes already in the cur@@ sing level , the amp@@ l@@ avi@@ ew is and , if possible , the Vir@@ us@@ last to check and replaced the cur@@ rant . &quot;
a dosage adjustment for one of the medicine is not required when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r last@@ ed along with amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vir@@ enz below ) .
508 % ra@@ ises for c@@ max on the other by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
&quot; in clinical tri@@ als , dos@@ es of 600 mg Amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , applied the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this treatment material . &quot;
52 % lower when Amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
&quot; a dos@@ ing of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but it is not recommended a closer monitoring because the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; there was no pharma@@ co@@ ma@@ tic study carried out in combination with th@@ dan@@ os@@ in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , due to the an@@ ta@@ ci@@ des component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and as@@ gener@@ are at least one hour each other ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
therefore with Gab@@ e from E@@ fa@@ vir@@ ility in combination with Amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dosage is required .
the treatment with E@@ fa@@ vir@@ ility in combination with amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ eas@@ e@@ wor@@ ms would be saved .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in to other prot@@ eas@@ e@@ wor@@ ms and existing limited data can be interpre@@ ted that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ is possibly sen@@ sible by Amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if this drug should be used simultaneously , as del@@ avi@@ r@@ din may be less effective because of the di@@ pped respectively may possibly be less effective . &quot;
&quot; if this drug is used together , caution ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ rology monitoring is to be made as an accurate forec@@ ast of the combination of Amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
the simult@@ aneous gift of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ tin ( Au@@ c ) of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin to 193 % and thus a rise in ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin connected side effects .
&quot; if there is necessary for clinical tri@@ als , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is required along with A@@ gener@@ ase , becomes a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data . &quot;
Phar@@ mak@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with as@@ gener@@ asis in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , however the plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ al of both medicine could be increased in the case of simult@@ aneous fort@@ une . &quot;
the simult@@ aneous use of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase in the C@@ max of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in the Plasma by 25 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily without the simult@@ aneous application of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , shirt or in@@ duc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , if they are used together with as@@ gener@@ ase , possibly lead to inter@@ actions . &quot;
patients should therefore be connected to tox@@ ic reactions that are connected to these drugs when they are used in combination with as@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ eas@@ e@@ wor@@ ms it is advis@@ able that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da could not be taken at the same time as as@@ gener@@ ase , as it can come to res@@ or@@ p@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; the simult@@ aneous use of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ s@@ ants , which are known as Enzy@@ me , phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , Carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ r ) , with Amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a gra@@ dation of the plas@@ mas@@ avi@@ r . &quot;

&quot; the cover of the effectiveness of as@@ gener@@ ating in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which with PI pre@@ defined adults according to vi@@ rology ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nu@@ cle@@ os ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , pre@@ domin@@ antly with low @-@ si@@ zed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; single @-@ three @-@ three ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus @-@ sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least one another PI and at least one NR@@ TI were included in the study study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ leg@@ acy of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in terms of the period ( HIV @-@ 1 @-@ R@@ NA ) in the plas@@ tic@@ .@@ al ( HIV @-@ 1 @-@ R@@ NA ) in the plas@@ ma after 16 weeks in accordance with a non @-@ sub@@ stitution of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
&quot; the cover of the effectiveness of un@@ bound@@ ed al@@ on@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 years , of which 152 were treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ative solution to take and capsules in dos@@ es of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22@@ ,5 mg / kg twice daily , whereas the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
there was no low do@@ zed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of those treated with PI pre@@ treated patients had previously been given at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the mer@@ ging NR@@ TI@@ s .
after 48 weeks about 25 % of the study included in the study of a plas@@ ma @-@ HIV concentration &lt; 10.000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with a medi@@ an increase in the CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the starting point .
19 Bas@@ ics on this data should be considered in the treatment project with PI pre@@ treated children the use of &quot; un@@ fulfilled &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
after or@@ phan@@ age the average duration ( T@@ max ) is up to maximum ser@@ um concentration of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % ra@@ ises for c@@ max on the other by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) along with Amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
&quot; the fil@@ ing of Amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % of departure of the Au@@ c , but has no effect on the concentration of Amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in the ste@@ ady @-@ State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected , although the simult@@ aneous dietary supplement the extent and the rate of res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
the appar@@ ent volume is about 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and leaves on a large placement volume as well as an enormous penetration of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissues .
&quot; this modification leads to a decrease of the overall concentration of the drug in the plas@@ ma , whereby the amount of un@@ trained amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r which represents the active proportion is probably un@@ changed . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ trained amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , vibr@@ ate the pro@@ zent@@ u@@ al portion of the free active component in dependence on the overall drug concentration in the ste@@ ady @-@ state across the range from C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicine must be in@@ duced in CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ duc@@ ate or in@@ hibi@@ ate or a sub@@ str@@ ate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with caution , if they are given simultaneously with as@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gab@@ e of A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily amp@@ ri@@ avi@@ r exposure as with adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
Amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r is from the solution 14 % less bio @-@ avail@@ able as of the capsules ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase solution and aur@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ change@@ able .
&quot; also the ren@@ al clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r neg@@ l@@ ected , therefore the impact of a kidney failure to be the elim@@ ination of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
this treatment schem@@ es lead to amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r @-@ plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ ds comparable to those who are made to healthy pro@@ ban@@ den after a dose of 1200 mg Amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simult@@ aneous tra@@ verse of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .

the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hep@@ at@@ cell@@ ular ather@@ oma and car@@ cin@@ oma has not yet been solved and the relev@@ ance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
&quot; however , for the present ex@@ posi@@ tional data on the people , both from clinical studies as well as from the therapeutic application , however , some evidence of the acceptance of a clinical relev@@ ance of this reference . &quot;
&quot; in a standard batter@@ ie of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse @-@ hom@@ os@@ ening lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes leg@@ ged , was Amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ iny nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ically . &quot;
these liver tox@@ icity can be monitor@@ ed and proven in clinical everyday life through measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase and proven . &quot;
&quot; so far , in clinical studies have not been observed yet significant liver tox@@ icity in patients , neither during the trial of as@@ gener@@ ating or after the end of the treatment . &quot;
Studies on tox@@ icity at vir@@ ility who were treated with the control of 4 days showed both the control and with amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r treated animals a high mort@@ ality .
&quot; with a system@@ ic Plas@@ ma@@ ex@@ position , the significantly less ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) as the expected exposure under therapeutic dosage , however , have been observed a number of low@@ ed changes including Th@@ y@@ mus@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and reduced sk@@ el@@ eton , which refer to a del@@ ayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ gener@@ a capsules are used without the rein@@ forced addition of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ding ) , must be applied higher dos@@ es to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral medicines to become a daily dose of 2400 mg ampli@@ avi@@ r that should not be exce@@ eded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simult@@ aneous use should be made in patients with weak or easier liver disorder with caution in patients with severe liver disorder ( see section 4.3 ) .

A@@ generic should be set on duration 27 when a r@@ ash of system@@ ic or allergic symptoms are accompanied or the mu@@ co@@ us membran@@ e ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; an increased risk for Li@@ po@@ dy@@ st@@ roph@@ y has been associated with individual factors such as higher ages , and with medication @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral treatment and the associated met@@ ab@@ olic disorders . &quot;
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in a 82 % reduction in the Au@@ c is caused by amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r that can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and can result in a resistance .
508 % ra@@ ises for c@@ max on the other by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
&quot; a dos@@ ing of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but it is not recommended a closer monitoring because the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ fa@@ vir@@ ility in combination with amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ eas@@ e@@ wor@@ ms would be saved .
&quot; if this drug is used together , caution ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ rology monitoring is to be made as an accurate forec@@ ast of the combination of Amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if there is necessary for clinical tri@@ als , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is required along with A@@ gener@@ ase , becomes a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dose 31 ger@@ ates , although there are no clinical data . &quot;

&quot; in the study , the security of the drug was examined , but it was also measured with its effectiveness in terms of reducing the ge@@ ag concent@@ rations in the urine and in terms of the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; with children under the age of five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me took about 60 % , and half of the treated children pointed out at the end of the study a normal large liver . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nau@@ sea , abdom@@ inal pain , mol@@ rop@@ athy ( joints ) , har@@ ness , f@@ ishes , f@@ ever and reactions at the in@@ fusion site . &quot;
&quot; very common side effects for patients under the age of five are increased blood pressure , decre@@ ased oxygen supply ( acceler@@ ated heart rate ) , f@@ ever and ch@@ ills . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may be used in patients who may not be extremely sensitive ( allergic ) to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other ingredients ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lak@@ etic reaction ) .
the European medic@@ inal agency ( E@@ ME@@ A ) will update all new information that may be well known and required this summary of required .
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients , the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , with regard to the reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies . &quot;
June 2003 the European Commission for the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. is a licence for the inver@@ t@@ ying of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human beings α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O @-@ M@@ amm@@ ers ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , Eier@@ stock of Chinese HAM@@ ST@@ ERS ) . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used to treat patients with assured diagnosis of a Mu@@ kop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ char@@ id@@ osis I ( MP@@ S I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase @-@ lack ) to treat the non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MP@@ S I or other inher@@ itable met@@ ab@@ olic disorders .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h may be when the patient contributes to a maximum dose of 43 e / kg / h .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients may not be recommended for dos@@ ing scheme .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is not determined in patients with kidney or liver care .
&quot; with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which are defined as any in connection with the imp@@ acts , which occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion accounts ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be monitor@@ ed and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be made available in an appropriate clinical environment , in the re@@ vit@@ alizing facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies immediately . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase @-@ 3 study , it is expected to form almost all the patients Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months of treatment . &quot;
&quot; patients , the antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ borne reaction , must be treated with regard to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with caution ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; as little experience with regard to re @-@ consumption of treatment after a longer break , due to the theore@@ tically increased risk to over@@ sensitivity reaction after a break of treatment should be cau@@ tious . &quot;
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tika ) to minimi@@ ze the potential occurr@@ ence in@@ fusion un@@ conditional reaction .
in case of a s@@ light or medium @-@ severe in@@ fusion treatment should treat the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in response to the reaction .
&quot; in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion un@@ conditional reaction , the in@@ fusion must be halt@@ ed until the symptoms are brought to the decl@@ ine , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen . &quot;
in@@ fusion can be recorded with a reduction of in@@ fusion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred again .
3 are ( Anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or Cor@@ tico@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of in@@ fusion rate .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied at the same time with chlor@@ o@@ quin or Pro@@ c@@ ain , because a potential risk of an inter@@ ference with the intra@@ oc@@ ular reception of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase exists . &quot;
&quot; animal experim@@ ental studies cannot be direct or indi@@ rect harmful effects on pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no data to new@@ bor@@ ns that were exp@@ ul@@ ed against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , over the mother &apos;s milk , is recommended to breast@@ feeding during the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
the side effects in clinical studies were arranged mainly as in@@ fusion @-@ related responses to be observed at 53 % of patients in the phase @-@ 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and at 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
un@@ wanted medication developed in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me that have been observed during the phase @-@ 3 study and its extension in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older in a treatment duration of up to 4 years are often listed in the following table below : 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; in some patients with severe MP@@ S @-@ I @-@ related participation of the upper resp@@ iratory tr@@ act and lungs in pre@@ history , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ mus , resp@@ iratory and facial ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children un@@ wanted drugs in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a ph@@ as@@ - 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with mainly heavy reliability and a treatment of up to 12 months , have been reported in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients there was within 3 months after the beginning of treatment to a ser@@ oc@@ on@@ version , whereby the patients aged under 5 years with a severe aband@@ on@@ ary form mostly within one month to a ser@@ oc@@ on@@ version ( average after 26 days at patients aged 5 years and older ) . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the phase @-@ 3 study ( or until a premature form@@ att@@ ing out of the study ) were in 13 / 45 patients not caused by radio@@ activity , including 3 patients , where it has never come to Ser@@ ok@@ on@@ version . &quot;
patients with error @-@ down to low antibodies are a stur@@ dy reduction in the har@@ ness in urine while in patients with high antibodies to determine a variable reduction of g@@ ag in the Har@@ n .
four patients ( three in the phase @-@ 3 study and one in the phase @-@ 2 study ) showed a mar@@ gin@@ al to low neutr@@ alised in@@ hibit@@ or@@ ic effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vit@@ ro which seemed to affect the clinical effectiveness and / or the reduction of g@@ ag in the Har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies did not seem to stand in connection with the incidence of un@@ wanted medication . also when the appearance of un@@ wanted antibiotics typically fell together with the formation of ignor@@ ant antibodies .
the reason for the enzy@@ mes is in one for the hydro@@ l@@ ysis of the accum@@ ulated sub@@ str@@ ate and the prevention of a further accum@@ ulation causes of the enzy@@ me .
&quot; after intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is swi@@ ft@@ ly removed from the circulation and cells into the l@@ ys@@ os@@ om@@ es , most probably about Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recep@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were investig@@ ated in a random@@ ized , double blin@@ ds , plac@@ eb@@ ok@@ on@@ tro@@ l@@ ated phase @-@ 3 study at 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; the patients were recru@@ ited for the study , the majority of patients were determined by the Middle phen@@ otype and only a patient pointed to serious phen@@ otype . &quot;
&quot; patients were recru@@ ited when they had an for@@ ci@@ fied exp@@ ir@@ ator@@ ic volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters . &quot;
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the pro@@ cal change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute navigation of the 6 @-@ Min@@ ut@@ - Ge@@ ht@@ est .
&quot; all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients compared to the plac@@ ebo group and the en@@ vi@@ ability that is shown in the following table .
&quot; in the open extension study , an improvement and / or maintain this effects of up to 208 weeks in such al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and the 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as shown from the table below . &quot;
the acceptance of the expected pro@@ zent@@ u@@ als FE@@ V is not significantly more significant about this period of time and the absolute L@@ amm@@ vol@@ um@@ ina increased further propor@@ tional to the body size of growing children .
&quot; from 26 patients with a Hep@@ atom@@ ic , prior to treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) to the end of the study a normal liver size . &quot;
&quot; within the first four weeks a significant waste of the G@@ ag @-@ mirror was established in Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ atin@@ in ) , which remained constant up to the study . &quot;
&quot; regarding the heter@@ ogen@@ eous disease area between patients , which was taken into account the clin@@ ically significant changes in the 6 @-@ minute ge@@ ht@@ est , moving area of the shoulder hei@@ ms ( 58 % ) , there was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a det@@ eri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
&quot; it was conducted a one @-@ year @-@ year @-@ two study conducted , in which mainly the security and pharma@@ co@@ sis of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was investig@@ ated at 20 patients the time of their recording in the study under 5 years old ( 16 patients with the heavy aband@@ on@@ ular form ) . &quot;
&quot; with four patients , the dosage was increased because of increased G@@ AG@@ - mirror in the Har@@ n in a week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg . &quot;
&quot; if several patients became a size of size ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) , according to the Z @-@ Score for this age group , and all 4 patients suffering from the severe aband@@ on@@ ular form ( &lt; 2,5 years ) and all 4 patients with the medium @-@ form factor ( &lt; 2,5 years ) and all 4 patients with severe aband@@ on@@ ular form only limited or no progress made in cogni@@ tive development . &quot;
in a phase @-@ 4 study investig@@ ations were conducted in pharma@@ co@@ odynam@@ ic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dos@@ ing schem@@ es on the G@@ ag @-@ mirror in the Har@@ n , the Leb@@ a volume and the 6 @-@ minute ge@@ ht@@ est . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the dosage scheme with 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous every 2 weeks can be in patients who have difficulty with weekly in@@ fusion , a representative alternative ; however , is not proven that the long term clinical effectiveness of these two dos@@ ing schem@@ es is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medi@@ cines Agency ( E@@ ME@@ A ) will evaluate each new information that will evaluate each year , and if required , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated . &quot;
the pharma@@ co@@ ine@@ tic profile for patients aged 5 years was similar to that in older and less heav@@ ily affected patients .

&quot; for the treatment of mal@@ ig@@ ar Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ der@@ oms , A@@ lim@@ ta was investig@@ ated in a major study of 456 patients who had previously received chem@@ otherapy against their disease . &quot;
the effects of non @-@ single lung cancer have been treated the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 571 patients with local advanced or metast@@ atic disease that previously worked with chem@@ otherapy with the effects of Doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medicine against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta also has been compared with Gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ in ( another medicine against cancer ) and both in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 725 patients who had previously received any chem@@ otherapy for lung cancer .
&quot; patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ pl@@ atin , survi@@ ved on average 12,@@ 1 month , compared to 9,@@ 3 months in the sole reference of Cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; patients who had previously received an chem@@ otherapy , was the average survival of time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8,@@ 3 months , compared to 7.4 months in Doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; however , patients also referred to patients with cancer cells , if the cancer of A@@ lim@@ ta is longer survival for longer than with the compar@@ isons of A@@ lim@@ ta longer survival . &quot;
September 2004 the European Commission for the company El@@ i Lil@@ ly Nederland B.@@ V. is a licence for the inver@@ t@@ ying of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each throug@@ h@@ bottle must be raised with 4.2 ml 0.@@ 9 % of Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ ch@@ ori@@ d inj@@ ection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) - which results a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary Do@@ - sis is taken from the throug@@ h@@ bottle and with 0.7 % iger Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ ch@@ ori@@ d inj@@ ection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) on 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is displayed in combination with Cis@@ pl@@ atin as the first @-@ line therapy of patients with local metast@@ atic or metast@@ atic bron@@ chi@@ al@@ kar@@ cin@@ oma except for extremely high @-@ scale @-@ ep@@ ith@@ eli@@ um Hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .

the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of the top ( KO@@ F ) received as intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of Cis@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours after completion of the P@@ emet@@ rex@@ ed@@ - In@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ single bron@@ chi@@ al@@ kar@@ zin@@ om , chem@@ otherapy is the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² ins known as intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle . &quot;
the reduction of the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reaction needs to be given on the day before and on the day of P@@ ei@@ rex@@ ed @-@ Gab@@ e as well as the day after treatment a cor@@ tico@@ ster@@ oid .
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ emet@@ rex@@ ed must be taken at least 5 cans of fol@@ ate , and the intake must be continued during the entire therapy time as well as for more 21 days after the last P@@ emet@@ rics dose . &quot;
patients also have to receive a in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular inj@@ ection vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week before the first P@@ emet@@ rex@@ ic dose as well as for every third evidence .
&quot; in patients , the P@@ emet@@ rex@@ ed should be created , should be created before every Gab@@ e a complete blood picture , including a differenti@@ ation of the leu@@ co@@ cy@@ tes and a thro@@ mb@@ ism . &quot;
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , Asp@@ art@@ at @-@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Al@@ an@@ in @-@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or SG@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 @-@ fold of the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dosage must take place under consider@@ ations of the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood @-@ blood , or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the predic@@ table treatment cycles . &quot;
&quot; after recovery the patients must be treated appropri@@ ately in tables of the tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are treated for ALI@@ M@@ TA as a mon@@ otherapy or in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity Criteria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) Tru@@ C@@ TC degree 2 ble@@ eding .
&quot; if patients should develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( Neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the therapy with ALI@@ M@@ TA must be inter@@ rupted , until the patient gets the value before the treatment &quot;
the treatment with ALI@@ M@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if in patients after 2 dos@@ is@@ tive tox@@ icity or non @-@ hem@@ ical tox@@ icity or non @-@ hem@@ ical tox@@ icity level 3 or 4 occurr@@ ence or so@@ - fort he takes place 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
Clinical studies have no reference that in patients at the age of 65 year@@ s@@ ers or compared to patients aged between 65 years and is an elev@@ ated by @-@ acting ris@@ i@@ - ko .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to in@@ adequate data for harm@@ lessness and effectiveness .
in clinical studies were necessary in patients with a cre@@ atin@@ in @-@ cle@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min there are no dosage adjustment necessary to go out for all patients recommended dosage adjustment . &quot;
the data base in patients with a cre@@ atine under 45 ml / min was not adequate ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver functioning of &gt; the 1,5 @-@ fold of the upper leg ; or &gt; 5,0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( near liver metast@@ ases ) is not specifically examined in studies . &quot;
patients must be monitor@@ ed with regard to the bone market and P@@ emet@@ rex@@ ed must not be passed on patients before their absolute neut@@ rop@@ ine value again has a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ mb@@ al cycle again has reached a value of ≥ 100@@ .000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
a dosage reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of the absolute neut@@ rop@@ ine value , thro@@ mb@@ al count and maximum non @-@ ug@@ mat@@ ology tox@@ icity as they observed in the previous treatment cycles - ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ ch@@ th@@ ic tox@@ icity such as Neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie , f@@ ebr@@ ile Neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie and infection with degree 3 / 4 Neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie has been be@@ amed if a pre @-@ treatment with fol@@ ate and vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients must be dependent with P@@ emet@@ rex@@ ed patients treated , fol@@ ate , and vitamin B@@ 12 as proph@@ y@@ - lak@@ etic measure for reduction @-@ related tox@@ icity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with light to medium @-@ efficiency in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simult@@ aneous intake of non@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ oxid@@ ative Anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and mind@@ es@@ - TE@@ NS 2 days after therapy with P@@ emet@@ rex@@ ed therapy ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; all patients , intended for treatment with P@@ emet@@ rex@@ ed treatment , the intake of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half pres@@ sur@@ plus for at least 5 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ emet@@ rex@@ ed therapy ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients , when these events occurred , corresponding risk factors for the appearance of ren@@ al events , including Deh@@ ydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid , accum@@ ulation in trans@@ ac@@ ular space a dra@@ inage of the ergometer in front of the P@@ emet@@ rex@@ ed treatment . &quot;
&quot; 5 serious cardi@@ ovascular events , including M@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ inf@@ arkt , and zer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events have been reported in clinical tri@@ als with P@@ emet@@ rex@@ ed occasionally , when this medication was typically administ@@ ered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ical ingredi@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; for this reason the simult@@ aneous use of prop@@ elled li@@ mbs ( except Gel@@ b@@ fi@@ eber , this vac@@ c@@ ination is con@@ ce@@ aled ) not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the possibility of an ir@@ reversible activation of the re@@ productive capacity is formed by P@@ emet@@ rex@@ ed , men should be pointed out before the treatment - gin@@ al , advice on the sperm @-@ service . &quot;
patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ atine in @-@ Clear@@ ance ( 80 ml / min ) can result in high dos@@ ing non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti ph@@ onic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1,3 g daily ) and ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1,3 g daily ) and ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ lic ex@@ cre@@ tion with the result of a multip@@ lied occurr@@ ence of side effects . &quot;
&quot; therefore , caution is provided if in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ atine in @-@ cle@@ ance ( 80 ml / min ) high dos@@ es of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or Ac@@ e- t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ lic acid can be applied in high dosage . &quot;

&quot; as no data relating to the interval potential of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ value as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or Ro@@ fe@@ co@@ xi@@ b , must be avo@@ ided the simult@@ aneous application with P@@ emet@@ rex@@ ed for at least 5 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ emet@@ rics . &quot;
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the pro@@ curement status during the disease and the possibility of inter@@ actions between or@@ al antibodies and ant@@ ine@@ oplast@@ y chem@@ otherapy demands an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ m@@ ical R@@ atio ) if the decision taken to treat patients with or@@ al antibodies .
&quot; there are no data for the use of P@@ ei@@ rex@@ ens in Schw@@ ang@@ eren , but as at an@@ de@@ - ren an@@ timet@@ ab@@ ites are expected to be expected for a application in the pregnancy of heavy birth effects . &quot;
P@@ emet@@ rex@@ ens must not be applied during pregnancy if absolutely in@@ - and after thor@@ ough check@@ out of the user for the mother and the risk for the fo@@ etus ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; as the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage of the re@@ productive capacity is made by P@@ emet@@ rex@@ ed , men should turn out before the treatment of treatment , advice on the sperm volume . &quot;

the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the populations of all patients who received the testing poor in the treatment poor ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a st@@ atis@@ tically significant improvement of the clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and Dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with the mal@@ ig@@ ar Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ ur@@ om was demonstrated by using the Lun@@ - gen@@ ic symp@@ tom@@ sk@@ ala in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / Cis@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the sole Cis@@ pl@@ a- arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two therapies found themselves by improving the lung @-@ functional parameters in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / Cis@@ pl@@ atin arm and a det@@ eri@@ oration of the lung function in the course of the contro@@ l@@ lar@@ m .

&quot; Alo@@ xi is applied to chem@@ otherap@@ ies and vom@@ iting ( like cis@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate out@@ breaks for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( such as Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , D@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or Carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be used by the extra gift of a cor@@ tico@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug which can be used as anti@@ em@@ e@@ tik@@ um ) .
the application for patients under the age of 18 is not recommended as to the effects of this age group not enough information .
&quot; this means that the ingredi@@ ent of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ otonin ) to prev@@ ents the recep@@ tors in the intest@@ ine . &quot;
Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies in 1 842 adults who received the chem@@ otherap@@ ies which are strong or moderate out@@ breaks for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting .
&quot; chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting are , showed 59 % of the patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of with un@@ dan@@ set@@ ron patients ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate out@@ breaks for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , showed 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of with un@@ dan@@ set@@ ron treated patients ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
with a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values are 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
March 2005 the European Commission adopted by the company Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmac@@ eu@@ ticals Ltd . a licence for the inver@@ ted by Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is index@@ ed : for the prevention of acu@@ ated nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting at heav@@ y@@ ad@@ ron chem@@ otherapy due to cancer patients and vom@@ iting at moderate chem@@ otherapy due to cancer treatment .
&quot; the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi to prevent the prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , which is reduced by adding a highly sophisticated chem@@ otherapy , can be strengthened through adding one before the chem@@ otherapy &quot; Cor@@ tico@@ ster@@ oids . &quot;
&quot; da Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ on massage , patients should be monitor@@ ed with an@@ am@@ nest@@ y tro@@ ver@@ ation or signs of a subtle nu@@ cle@@ us after the inj@@ ection . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists however , caution appears with simult@@ aneous gifts of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medication that extends the Q@@ T @-@ Inter@@ v@@ all , or in patients with which the Q@@ T @-@ interval is extended or those of such an extension . &quot;
&quot; except in connection with another chem@@ otherap@@ ist gifts , Alo@@ xi is neither to prevent or prevent or to treat nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in pre@@ clinical tri@@ als , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , the estimated activity of the five oppressed chem@@ otherap@@ ist not ( cis@@ pl@@ atin , cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , and Mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , there showed no significant end@@ ocr@@ acy interaction between a unique intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady @-@ stat@@ e- concentration or@@ al Met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 in@@ hibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; in one of a population @-@ based pharma@@ co@@ ine@@ tic analysis was shown that the simult@@ aneous gift of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 in@@ hibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ od@@ ar@@ on , Cel@@ esi@@ op@@ ar@@ on , Flu@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , Par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , Par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , Par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , Ch@@ ini@@ din , Er@@ otic@@ al@@ in and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) has no significant impact on the clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; experience for the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron at human pregn@@ anci@@ es are not used , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used by pregnant women , unless it is necessary by the treatment doctor as necessary . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies were the most common with a dosage of 250 mc@@ g to be watching side effects ( total 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least possibly with Alo@@ xi in the context of head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and above ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity re@@ constructions and reactions at the final place ( burning , har@@ den@@ ing , complaints and pain ) were given in post @-@ marketing experience . &quot;
in the group with the highest dosage showed similar skins of un@@ wanted events such as in the other dos@@ ing groups ; there were no dose of efficiency to observe .
&quot; there were no dial@@ ysis studies conducted , due to the great distribut@@ ing is a dial@@ ysis , however no effective therapy for a al@@ oe @-@ flo@@ od@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ized pi@@ ining studies have been received a total of 1.@@ 132 patients , which received a standard bet@@ ogenic chem@@ otherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 micro@@ gram Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , with patients compared to the 32 mg of On@@ dan@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ day 3 hours ) , which was given by day 1 without D@@ exam@@ eth@@ as@@ on intra@@ ven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ized dup@@ lic@@ ation study , a total of 667 patients , which received a highly sophisticated chem@@ otherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ arb@@ az@@ in as well as 250 or 750 mc@@ g. Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , with patients compared to the 32 mg of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given to day 1 intra@@ ven@@ ous . &quot;
results of the studies with moderate chem@@ otherapy and study with strongly suffer@@ er chem@@ otherapy are summ@@ ari@@ zed in the following tables .
in clinical studies for the indications of chem@@ otherapy in@@ duced nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( CIN@@ V ) were the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron based on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c inter@@ v@@ alls with the appropriate effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; according to the inv@@ ented pre@@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the involved in the vent@@ ric@@ ular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ation of the associ@@ ates involved and extend the duration of the action spot@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study conducted by 221 healthy pro@@ ban@@ den study was the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of i@@ .v@@ . administ@@ ered Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single d@@ ants of 0,@@ 25 , 0.75 and 2,@@ 25 mg . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption After intra@@ ven@@ o@@ ser Gab@@ e follows on a initi@@ als of the Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ zentr@@ ationen a slow elim@@ ination of the body with an average termin@@ ale half @-@ value of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plastic concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area below the concentration of @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally included in the entire dosage range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg with gest@@ on@@ ist dos@@ is@@ propor@@ tional .
&quot; after intra@@ ven@@ ous Gab@@ e from Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 cans , the middle of 11 co@@ ar@@ ques were between day 1 and day 5 measured medium ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron @-@ Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ ment at 42 ± 34 % . &quot;
&quot; from pharma@@ co@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations indicate that those at once daily intra@@ ven@@ ous Gab@@ e from 0,@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to 3 consec@@ u@@ tive days ; however , the C@@ max after the entry of 0.75 mg higher . &quot;
about 40 % are elimin@@ ated via the kid@@ neys and about additional 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ ab@@ olic compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron using less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recep@@ tor .
&quot; in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ Studies for Met@@ abol@@ isation have shown that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and , in less dimensions , the I@@ so@@ enz@@ ym@@ ers CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 at the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; Eli@@ mination After an intra@@ ven@@ ous individual dose of 10 micro@@ gram / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found about 80 % of the dosage within 144 hours of urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
after a unique intra@@ ven@@ ous Bol@@ usin@@ j@@ ection with gest@@ oring was the total body adjustment of 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
&quot; although in patients with severe liver disorder , the termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ alb@@ eit and the average system@@ ic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , a reduction of dose is therefore non @-@ justified . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , effects were observed only after exposure to be seen as sufficient for the maximum of human therapeutic exposure , resulting in a small relev@@ ance for the clinical use . &quot;
10 From pre@@ clinical studies gave information to that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only be block@@ ed in very high concent@@ rations - which are involved in the vent@@ ric@@ ular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and can extend the action of potential .
&quot; high dos@@ es of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( every dose does not have been given in about the 30@@ folding of the therapeutic exposure in humans , which were given by two years , led to a multip@@ ly frequency of liver , end@@ oc@@ ular , panc@@ re@@ as , panc@@ re@@ as , and skin tum@@ ors , but not on mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the used high dos@@ es and since Alo@@ xi is intended for a unique application , the relev@@ ance of these results will be evaluated for people . &quot;

June 2006 adop@@ ts the Committee on Human@@ cis@@ nei@@ medium ( CH@@ MP ) a neg@@ atives of the permission of the treatment of hep@@ atitis C in the intended drugs called Alph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml inj@@ ection solution .
&quot; this means that Alph@@ eon a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A should res@@ em@@ bles with the same phar@@ ma cutting , which is already approved in the EU ( also &quot; &quot; Reference _ horizontal &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
Alph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chron@@ ic ( long lasting ) Hep@@ atitis C ( one by vi@@ ral infection ) .
&quot; in a micro@@ s@@ copic investigation the liver tissue referred to , the values of the liver enz@@ ym@@ ers Al@@ an@@ in@@ - Amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) increases in the blood of the life . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced to the formation of the drug . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Alph@@ eon provide data to compare the comparison of alph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active structure , composition and p@@ urity of the drug , efficiency , safety and effectiveness of hep@@ atitis C ) . &quot;
in the study of patients with hep@@ atitis C the effectiveness of alph@@ eon has been compared to the effectiveness of the reference rate of 455 patients .
&quot; in the study , how many patients were measured to 12 from a total of 48 treatments , as well as 6 months after setting of treatment to the medication ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood ) . &quot;

&quot; in addition , concerns have been expressed concerns that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug is not sufficient . &quot;
&quot; the number of patients with hep@@ atitis C , who spoke to the treatment with Alph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in the clinical study . &quot;
&quot; after setting the treatment with alph@@ eon , the disease fl@@ amed of more patients back again than with the reference rate ; moreover , Alph@@ eon more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , in the study initi@@ ated test to investig@@ ate the question , in@@ wi@@ ew@@ eit the medication forms an imm@@ unity ( i.e. the body forms anti - special proteins - against drug ) , not suffici@@ ently vali@@ dated . &quot;
it can be applied to the treatment of Imp@@ e@@ tig@@ o ( one with cru@@ ci@@ ous skin infection ) and small inf@@ ect@@ ated Laz@@ er@@ ations ( cr@@ acks or chi@@ pped ) , ab@@ uses and se@@ aled wo@@ unds . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections , which may be caused by meth@@ yl@@ lic @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Al@@ ar@@ go against this kind of infections may not affect . &quot;
Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied to patients from the age of nine months but for patients under 18 years of age may not be more than 2 % of the body surface .
&quot; if the patient speaks for two to three days , the physi@@ cian should investig@@ ate patients again and investig@@ ate alternative treatments . &quot;
it affects block@@ ing the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ om@@ es ( parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and in@@ fr@@ amed the growth of bacteria .
Haupt@@ indi@@ k@@ ator of effectiveness was achieved in all five studies of the proportion of patients , whose infection was canc@@ elled after the end of the treatment . &quot;
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under plac@@ ebo spoke to the treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected der@@ iv@@ go , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ exin are similar to advise : when the results of both studies were gathered together with skin condition , about 90 % of the patients of both groups to treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies , however , Al@@ tar@@ go was found in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( un@@ stuff@@ ed cav@@ ity ) or of infections , which caused by MR@@ SA are not effective enough . &quot;
the most common side @-@ effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation on the order .
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ ists ( CH@@ MP ) succe@@ eded in the conclusion that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go in the short @-@ term skin infections compared to the risks : • Imp@@ e@@ tig@@ o , • infected small Laz@@ ations , ab@@ used or se@@ aled wo@@ unds . &quot;
may 2007 approved the European Commission for G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . a licence for the frei@@ ght of Al@@ tar@@ go in the entire European Union .
&quot; patients , in which within two to three days there is no improvement , should even be investig@@ ated once and be considered as an altern@@ ativ@@ point therapy ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a sen@@ ming or serious local confusion due to the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in o@@ be , the treatment should be broken , the sal@@ ine has been carefully m@@ opped and an adequate alternative therapy of the infection . &quot;
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in should not be applied to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known or proj@@ ected ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical studies in sec@@ ondary , open wo@@ unds was the effectiveness of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in patients with infections , which were caused by a meth@@ ic@@ illin @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) in@@ sufficient . &quot;
an alternative therapy should be considered when after a 2- to 3 @-@ day treatment no better or det@@ eri@@ oration of the infected place .
the effect of simult@@ aneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in and other top@@ ical resources on the same skin is not examined and the simult@@ aneous use of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plas@@ mac@@ mill@@ ers , which have been reached in people according to top@@ ical use on sec@@ lu@@ ded skin or infected wo@@ unds , is a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo not expected to expect ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect against hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B ( diseases that affect the liver ) in children between one and 15 years that are not imm@@ un against these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is applied in the frame of one of two cans of existing vac@@ cin@@ ations and a protection against hep@@ atitis B may only be achieved after con@@ ce@@ ase the second dose .
&quot; for this reason Ambi@@ rix must be used only if the immun@@ isation is a lower risk of hep@@ atitis B infection , and is en@@ sured that consisting of two dos@@ es existing vac@@ cines can be reached at the end . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her dose for hep@@ atitis A or B is desired , Ambi@@ rix or another hep@@ atitis A@@ - or B @-@ vaccine can be given . &quot;
&quot; vac@@ cines have an effect by bringing the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) , &quot; as it can be def@@ enses against an illness . &quot;
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the viruses and surface of anti@@ gens than &quot; foreign &quot; and creates antibodies against it . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix includes the same ingredients as the established vaccine Twin@@ rix adults and since 1997 approved vaccine Twin@@ rix Children .
&quot; the three vac@@ cines have applied to the protection against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix kids can be administ@@ ered in the frame of three dos@@ es existing vac@@ cin@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults are identical ingredients , some of the data that uses the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also used as a letter for the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indi@@ c@@ ator of the effectiveness was the proportion of the vac@@ cin@@ ated children that had developed a month after the last inj@@ ection .
in an additional study with 208 children the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared to a six@@ ty and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix led up between 98 and 100 % of the vac@@ cin@@ ated children a month after the last inj@@ ection for the development of sh@@ ining antibodies against hep@@ atitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix had similar to six @-@ month and at a 12 @-@ month distance between the inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vac@@ cines ) are head@@ ache , appe@@ tite man@@ gel , pain in the inj@@ ection site , red@@ ness , mat ( fatigue ) as well as matur@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix must be used in patients who may not be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an anti@@ biotic ) . &quot;
August 2002 the European Commission held the company G@@ lax@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Biolog@@ icals a. a licence for the inver@@ t@@ ling of Ambi@@ rix in the whole
the standardi@@ zed plan for the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ in@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two imp@@ r@@ ons with the first dose when choosing the choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose .
&quot; if a refres@@ her is desired for hep@@ atitis A as well as for hep@@ atitis B , can be vac@@ cin@@ ated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ents vac@@ cines or with a combination of combinations . &quot;
the according to a pri@@ ce@@ ase di@@ zation with the combinations of anti @-@ hep@@ atitis B - and anti @-@ hep@@ atitis @-@ A @-@ Virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibodies lie in the same size as according to vac@@ c@@ ination with the particular mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ents vac@@ cines .
&quot; it is not yet totally secured , whether imm@@ ig@@ rants who have addressed to a hep@@ atitis A@@ - vaccine would be addressed as protection because they may not be protected by the immun@@ o@@ idal memory by the immun@@ ological memory . &quot;
3 How with all inj@@ ection of inj@@ ection should be available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lak@@ etic reaction after the Gab@@ e of the vaccine appropriate means of medical treatment and monitoring always available .
&quot; if a faster protection against hep@@ atitis B is required , the standardi@@ zed sch@@ ema is recommended that the 360 EL@@ ISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activation hep@@ atitis @-@ A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hep@@ atitis B . &quot;
&quot; at Hä@@ modi@@ aly@@ tic patients and persons with dist@@ urbances of the immune system , according to the pri@@ ce@@ ase anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies can be achieved so that in these cases the gifts will be more import@@ ed . &quot;
as an intra@@ der@@ male inj@@ ection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular con@@ ce@@ ase to an optimal imp@@ fer@@ mentation could be avo@@ ided these inj@@ ection should be avo@@ ided .
&quot; in thro@@ wing cy@@ ge@@ y or blood circulation disorders , Ambi@@ rix cannot realis@@ ed sub@@ k@@ ut@@ an inj@@ ected since it can occur in these cases after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular Gab@@ e . &quot;
&quot; when Ambi@@ rix left in the second life @-@ year in the form of a separate inj@@ ection , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ yel@@ ia , in@@ activated pol@@ om@@ yel@@ i@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us , in@@ activated pol@@ om@@ yel@@ i@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us @-@ Rö@@ t@@ uss@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us @-@ vaccine due to all anti@@ gens are sufficient ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
patients suffering from immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune def@@ ects must be caused by that there may be no adequate immune answers .
&quot; in a clinical trial , which was comp@@ lem@@ ented with 3 imp@@ les of this form@@ ulation in adults , was the frequency of pain , red@@ ness , op@@ pression , ancest@@ ry , nerv@@ ousness and f@@ ever comparable to the frequency that has been observed in the former Thi@@ om@@ ers@@ al and preser@@ v@@ ative vac@@ cines . &quot;
in clinical studies 20@@ 29 Imp@@ r@@ ots Ambi@@ rix left a total of 10@@ 27 imp@@ ris@@ on@@ ment at the age of 1 to 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 and including 15 years the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix has been compared to the 3 @-@ cans of combinations .
&quot; only excep@@ tions were the higher frequency of pain and food based on a calculated basis per imp@@ ris@@ osis Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation base per person . &quot;
Pain was observed after the Gab@@ e of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.7 % of the Pro@@ ban@@ den compared to 39,@@ 1 % in the Pro@@ ban@@ den after the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ cans combinations .
&quot; according to the complete vac@@ u@@ id , 66@@ ,@@ 4 % of the Pro@@ ban@@ den , the Ambi@@ rix received , over pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % at the trial , which were vac@@ cin@@ ated with the 3 @-@ dosage combined with the 3 @-@ dosage combinations . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of Mat@@ ality was comparable to high ( i.e. about the entire vaccine cycle at 39,@@ 6 % of the Pro@@ ban@@ den , the Ambi@@ rix came , compared with 36,@@ 2 % in the Pro@@ ban@@ den , which received the 3 @-@ cans product combinations ) . &quot;
the frequency of pain and mat@@ ology was low and comparable to that which was observed after fil@@ ing the combinations of combinations with the 3 @-@ cans vac@@ cines .
&quot; in a compar@@ ative study of 1- until 11 @-@ year imp@@ air@@ ments , the appearance of locom@@ otive group was comparable to that with the 3 @-@ cans product @-@ shaped hep@@ atitis @-@ A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant@@ em hep@@ atitis B . &quot;
&quot; however , with the 6@@ - to 11@@ - j@@ acks , however , according to vac@@ c@@ ination with ambi@@ tion was a frequent appearance of pain ( at the inj@@ ection site ) per dosage , not per person , reports . &quot;
&quot; the share of imp@@ lies , which reported on severe side effects during the 2 @-@ cans vaccine with ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ cans vac@@ cines with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activation Hep@@ atitis @-@ A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant@@ em Hep@@ atitis B , was st@@ atis@@ tically not different . &quot;
&quot; in clinical tri@@ als , which were carried out at imp@@ air@@ ing at the age of 1 to 15 years , the Ser@@ ok@@ on@@ ver@@ sion@@ sr@@ al were carried out for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.9 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , the month 6 administ@@ ered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Ser@@ ok@@ on@@ ver@@ sion@@ sr@@ ats for Anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4,2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , the month 6 administ@@ ered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a compar@@ ative study , which was conducted at 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year old , 142 two cans of ambi@@ rix and 147 the standard combined with three dos@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in the 289 persons whose imm@@ ogen@@ eit@@ y was ext@@ end@@ able , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection betra@@ y@@ al ( SP in the table below ) against Hep@@ atitis B in the month 2 and 6 to Gab@@ e of the 3 @-@ dosage is significantly higher than with ambi@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; the immune answers that have been achieved in a clinical trial of 1- until 11 @-@ year , a month after completion of the full vac@@ cines ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
in both studies the imp@@ orts of either a 2 @-@ cans vac@@ cines with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ cans vac@@ cines with 360 EL@@ ISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis @-@ A @-@ Virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant@@ em Hep@@ atitis @-@ B @-@ Ober@@ flächen@@ an@@ tigen .
&quot; when people who were between 12 and 15 years old , the per@@ sistence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies could be proven for at least 24 months after the immun@@ isation using Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vac@@ cines . &quot;
&quot; in this study the immune reaction was comparable to both anti@@ gens that was formed after vac@@ c@@ ination of 3 cans with a combination of combinations consisting of 360 EL@@ ISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activation Hep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant@@ em Hep@@ atitis B @-@ Ober@@ flächen@@ an@@ tigen in a dos@@ ing volume of 0.5 ml . &quot;
in a clinical trial at 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ old could be demonstrated that the per@@ sistence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies are comparable to the 0 @-@ 6@@ - months vac@@ cines .
&quot; if the first dose is Ambi@@ rix in the second life of life at the same time with the ascent of a combined Di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ yel@@ i@@ tis@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us stu@@ ds , in@@ activated Poli@@ om@@ yel@@ i@@ tis@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us @-@ ro@@ b @-@ vaccine has been administ@@ ered to all anti@@ gens . &quot;
&quot; a clinical trial , which was carried out with 3 dos@@ es of current form@@ ulation in adults , showed similar to the present phr@@ ase similar Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and Ser@@ ok@@ on@@ ver@@ sion@@ sr@@ ats as for the former form@@ ulation . &quot;
the vaccine is both before and after res@@ um@@ or by ophthalm@@ ologist on any foreign @-@ particles and / or physi@@ cally visible changes .

&quot; the hep@@ atitis @-@ A virus is usually transferred by vi@@ ral foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other paths , such as bathing in by waste @-@ waters . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark Ur@@ ine , a p@@ ale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yellow@@ ing ) and other symptoms which may make a stationary treatment . &quot;
&quot; as with all vac@@ cines , Ambi@@ rix cannot be fully protected from an infection with hep@@ atitis A@@ - or hep@@ atitis B virus , even if the full vaccine has been completed with 2 cans . &quot;
if you are infected with hep@@ atitis B. Ambi@@ rix already infected with hep@@ atitis B. A@@ - or hep@@ atitis B virus ( even if you do not feel uncomfortable or sick ) may not feel uncomfortable or sick .
&quot; a protection against other infections , which are the liver damage or symptoms which are similar to those after a hep@@ atitis A@@ - or hep@@ atitis B infection , cannot be adopted . &quot;
• If you have an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an anti@@ biotic ) .
&quot; an allergic reaction can be found through ju@@ icy r@@ ashes , resp@@ iration or sw@@ elling of the face or the tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vac@@ c@@ ination against hep@@ atitis A or Hep@@ atitis B . • If you have a serious infection with f@@ ever . &quot;
• If you wish to have a protection against hep@@ atitis B ( i.e. in the period of 6 months and before the usually design@@ ation of the second imp@@ ris@@ osis ) .
&quot; with a possible risk of infection with hep@@ atitis B between the first and second vac@@ c@@ ination , the doctor will advise you on your child from a vac@@ c@@ ination with ambi@@ tion . &quot;
instead he will recommend to you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hep@@ atitis C / hep@@ atitis B @-@ vaccine with a reduced amount of effective components per imp@@ r@@ ini@@ in@@ activation hep@@ atitis @-@ A @-@ Virus and 10 micro@@ gram of a re@@ combin@@ ant Hep@@ atitis B @-@ Ober@@ feld@@ cru@@ gens ) .
the second Imp@@ fd@@ osis of this vaccine with reduced levels of effective components is usually processed for a month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vaccine protection against the vaccine in the vaccine .
&quot; sometimes Ambi@@ rix will suffer for people who suffer from severe blood circulation disorders , among the skin and not in the muscle . • If you are exp@@ ecting your child because of a disease or treatment in your body &apos;s own dis@@ infection . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix cannot be given in these cases but the immune answers to those individuals may not be adequate so that a blood test can be required to see how strong the response to vac@@ c@@ ination .
21 Are you your doctor if you use / your child can take additional drugs ( including those you can get without cas@@ ing ) or if you / your child has recently been vac@@ cin@@ ated / or immun@@ og@@ lo@@ bul@@ ins ( antibodies ) / has been planned or planned in the near future .
but it can be that in this case the immune answers to the vaccine is not adequate and the person is therefore not protected against one or both Hep@@ atitis A and B viruses .
&quot; if a different vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , should be vac@@ cin@@ ated to separate places and as possible as possible li@@ mbs . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix left for the same time or shortly before or after an inj@@ ection of immun@@ og@@ lo@@ bul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine is still sufficient . &quot;
&quot; usually , Ambi@@ rix Schw@@ ang@@ eren or breast@@ feeding women will not be administ@@ ered unless it is urg@@ ently needed that they are vac@@ cin@@ ated both against hep@@ atitis A as well as hep@@ atitis B . &quot;
important information on certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( anti@@ biotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vac@@ c@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs to 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs to 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; based on the data that has been known since issu@@ ance of the first approval for the inver@@ ter , the CH@@ MP opinion that the benefit @-@ risk ratio of Ambi@@ rix remains positive . &quot;
&quot; since Ambi@@ rix has been taken only in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this drug is limited due to its low patient position . &quot;
ammon@@ i@@ eed can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with a complete enzy@@ me enzy@@ me or with hyper@@ ammon@@ i@@ tive enzy@@ mes ( hier@@ archy of high ammon@@ ia ) in pre@@ history .
&quot; Amm@@ on@@ schn@@ apps - split into multiple items with meals - swallow@@ ed , among the food mixed or over a gast@@ ric tube ( by the abdom@@ en in the stomach leading ) or a Nas@@ en@@ son@@ de ( through the nose in the stomach leading ) . &quot;
it was not a compar@@ ative study because ammon@@ ite cannot be compared with another treatment or with plac@@ ebo ( a ph@@ eas@@ e@@ ament ; i.e. without active ) .
&quot; Amm@@ on@@ es@@ eed can also lead to appe@@ tite , an ab@@ norm@@ alities , irrit@@ ation , head@@ aches , ob@@ es@@ ness , sp@@ inal pain , flav@@ ours , vom@@ iting , dist@@ urb@@ ing , dist@@ urb@@ ing , dist@@ urb@@ ing , un@@ pleasant body , or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee on Human@@ ists ( CH@@ MP ) succe@@ eded in the conclusion that ammon@@ ium in patients with disorders of the urea cycle to high ammon@@ ia values effectively prev@@ ents .
Amm@@ on@@ eed was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; because of the rar@@ ity of the illness at the time of approval was limited to this medicine .
the use is index@@ ed in all patients with a complete enzy@@ me already in the new@@ born old ( within the first 28 Living Museum ) .
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ fixed form ( un@@ complete enzy@@ me effect , which is manifest@@ ed after the first life @-@ level ) then consists of an indic@@ t@@ ment for use when in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese of hyper@@ ammon@@ i@@ opathy . &quot;
&quot; for inf@@ ants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with sle@@ eves is AM@@ ER@@ PS also available in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form . &quot;
&quot; the daily dose is calculated individually under consideration of protein , toler@@ ances for the growth and development required daily prot@@ ocol@@ s of the patient . &quot;
&quot; after previous clinical experiences , the normal day of daily dose is a normal daily dose of weight : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in Her@@ an@@ growing and adults . &quot;
&quot; patients who suffer from a fixed lack of Carb@@ am@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ asis or Or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ sc@@ arb@@ am@@ yl@@ ase , is the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ ru@@ ll@@ in or Ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
&quot; patients with a ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ asis lack must be ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 4 - 0,@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8,@@ 8 - 15,@@ 4 g / m ² / day . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ ET@@ PS tablets may not be administ@@ ered to patients with eggs , as a risk for the emergence of o@@ hi@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ zer@@ a if the tablets are not right away in the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ EN@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 mm@@ ol ) so@@ dium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 mm@@ ol ) so@@ dium per 20 g Nat@@ ri@@ ump@@ hen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum day@@ time dose . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ ET@@ PS , should therefore be used in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure and severe kidney failure , as well as with Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ re@@ tention and eco@@ system in limited clinical states only with caution . &quot;
&quot; since Met@@ abol@@ isation and ex@@ cre@@ tion of so@@ dium in@@ put@@ ty on the liver and the kid@@ neys , should be applied to the liver with liver or kidney failure . &quot;
the importance of these results in terms of pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ ER@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ sting ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; with sub@@ k@@ ut@@ aner Gab@@ e from phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate on young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ ing of neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and to a st@@ ressed loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
it also found a del@@ ayed matur@@ ation of cer@@ eb@@ ral synagog@@ ues and a decre@@ ased number of functional ner@@ ves in the brain and therefore a disability of the de@@ af growth .
&quot; it could not be established whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is di@@ vor@@ ced by people in the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason is the use of AM@@ ER@@ PS during the lact@@ ation period ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
in clinical tri@@ als with AM@@ FA@@ PS entered at 56 % of the patients at least one undes@@ irable event ( AE ) on and at 78 % of these un@@ wanted events that they did not have linked to AM@@ ET@@ PS .
&quot; frequency is defined as follows : very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able tox@@ ic reaction to AM@@ EN@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) has been reported by a 18 year old an@@ or@@ ek@@ tic patient , which developed a met@@ ab@@ olic rate of hy@@ po@@ kal@@ emia , pan@@ cy@@ top@@ ia , peri@@ ph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy and panc@@ re@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of a survi@@ zation occurred at a 5 month old to@@ dd@@ ler with an acci@@ dental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accum@@ ulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate one that showed at an intra@@ ven@@ ous con@@ ges@@ tion of dos@@ es up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ si@@ zing Neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ ab@@ olic active connection that is caused by ac@@ ul@@ amin with gl@@ ut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine that is sec@@ lu@@ ded by the kid@@ neys .
&quot; St@@ ö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ric seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine can be comparable to urea ( both connections contain 2 nit@@ rogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to the ex@@ cre@@ tion of ex@@ cess styles . &quot;
5 patients with inter@@ rup@@ tions of the urea cycle can be accepted that for each gram@@ mati@@ cal so@@ dium fa@@ i@@ but@@ yr@@ ate between 0.12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine nit@@ rogen can be produced .
&quot; it is of meaning that the diagnosis is early and the treatment is immediately started to improve the survival , and the clinical results . &quot;
&quot; the pro@@ gn@@ osis of the early manifest@@ ed form of the condition with appearance of the first symptoms in the new@@ born old was almost always inf@@ ants , and the disease led himself in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ dial@@ y@@ se and essential amino acids or with their im@@ ages@@ Free analy@@ zed within the first life @-@ year to death . &quot;
&quot; due to Hem@@ at@@ al@@ ysis , the utili@@ zation of ag@@ rid of the stit@@ ch ( so@@ dium ) , prot@@ ri@@ um@@ ben@@ zo@@ at , and so@@ dium of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rates at post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first living conditions ) of post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first living conditions ) of post@@ al diseases on 80 % . &quot;
&quot; in patients , whose disease was diagnos@@ ed in the course of pregnancy and were already treated before the first occurr@@ ence of a hyper@@ ammon@@ ite em@@ body opathy , was the survival of 100 % , but even with these patients there came with the time for many to mental disabilities or other neurolog@@ ical de@@ fi@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a del@@ ayed shape of the disease ( including female patients with the heter@@ ozy@@ g@@ otic form of the Or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ sc@@ arb@@ am@@ yl@@ ase @-@ Man@@ gels ) , which were treated with Nat@@ ri@@ ump@@ hen@@ yl flooring and afterwards permanently treated with so@@ dium diet , was the survival of 98 % . &quot;
already existing neurolog@@ ical de@@ ficit are also barely reversible and in some patients may cause further det@@ eri@@ oration of neurolog@@ ical tra@@ its .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is oxi@@ fies in phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate oxi@@ des , which is produced in liver and kidney enz@@ ym@@ atic with gl@@ ut@@ amine , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine is created . &quot;
&quot; the concent@@ rations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ ab@@ ites in plas@@ ma and urine have been determined by Gab@@ e of a single dose of 5 g Nat@@ ri@@ ump@@ hen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at for individual award as well as repeti@@ tive Gab@@ en of or@@ als , as well as repeti@@ tive gifts of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled studies ) . &quot;
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites was also examined in cancer patients according to intra@@ ven@@ ous Gab@@ e of Nat@@ ri@@ ump@@ hen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
according to a or@@ ral single dose of 5 g Nat@@ ri@@ ump@@ hen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in tablet form were found 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable Plas@@ mac@@ er@@ cent@@ ations by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
for the majority of patients with urea cycle or her@@ m@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) at the next morning after no@@ isy fa@@ i@@ acet@@ ate in plas@@ ma .
&quot; for three of six patients with life cir@@ cuits that were repeated by Nat@@ ri@@ ump@@ hen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three single pants ) , the average phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concent@@ rations in plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ ety on the third day five times higher than after the first for@@ ks . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is served within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of counter@@ ed product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine via the kid@@ neys .
according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests had so@@ dium caused by tox@@ ic and non @-@ tox@@ ic effects ( examination 24 and 48 h after or@@ bit de@@ preci@@ ation of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
&quot; AM@@ ET@@ PS Gran@@ ul@@ at is used either oral ( inf@@ ants and children who can still swal@@ low any tablets , or patients with plac@@ ements ) or via a gast@@ ro@@ wing machine . &quot;
&quot; after previous clinical experiences , the normal day of daily dose is a normal daily dose of inf@@ eri@@ or : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day at new@@ bor@@ ns , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in Her@@ an@@ growing and adults . &quot;

&quot; angi@@ ox is used for the treatment of adult patients with &quot; ac@@ ute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ con &quot; ( AC@@ S , reduced blood flow to the heart ) , for example at inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or mo@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ inf@@ arkt ( cardi@@ ac ) without &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ ung &quot; ( an an@@ om@@ al level worth at electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox applied to the prevention of blood @-@ cl@@ aus@@ ages in patients with a higher dose reaches , and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can contribute to the heart of patients with Ang@@ ina or heart attack on maintaining the blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S , in which the effect of angi@@ ox in the sole gift , or in connection with a gly@@ co@@ se @-@ I@@ I@@ b / I@@ I@@ I@@ a in@@ hibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , a different drug treatment with hep@@ arin ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a G@@ PI is compared . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI patients the patients frequently used a St@@ ent ( a short skirts , which in the arter@@ ies remains to prevent a sh@@ utter ) , and they also received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ ma@@ b and asp@@ ir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; at the treatment of AC@@ S was angi@@ ox - with or without Gab@@ e of G@@ PI , in prevention of new events ( deaths , cardi@@ ac disease or re@@ vit@@ alization ) after 30 days or a year altogether as effective as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; patients who sub@@ missions to one PCI was angi@@ ox in terms of all indicators just as effective as hep@@ arin , except for serious ble@@ eding , when it was significantly more effective than Hep@@ arin . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox should not be applied to patients , which may possibly be over@@ sensi@@ tively ( allergic ) to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , other Hi@@ ru@@ dine or any of the ingredients . &quot;
&quot; it may not be applied to patients who recently had a blood , as well as for people with strong hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or cardi@@ ac infection . &quot;
the Committee on Human@@ ists ( CH@@ MP ) succe@@ eded at the conclusion that angi@@ ox is used in the treatment of AC@@ S and during a PCI replacement replacement for hep@@ um@@ arin .
September 2004 the European Commission for the Company The Medi@@ cines Company UK Ltd was a licence for the inver@@ t@@ ying angi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with ac@@ ute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ con ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ Heb@@ ungs@@ inf@@ arkt ( IA / NS@@ TE@@ MI ) ) in an emer@@ gency room or if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initi@@ ation of angi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intra@@ ven@@ ous bol@@ us@@ ement of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if the patient is done in another episode , an additional Bol@@ us should be increased from 0,5 mg / kg , and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the inputs to 1,@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; after the PCI Express use the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0,@@ 25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the procedure , a bol@@ us@@ ement of 0.5 mg / kg administ@@ ered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1,@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with one PCI consists of a initi@@ als intra@@ ven@@ ous bol@@ us@@ ement of 0.75 mg / kg body weight , with a dose of 1,@@ 75 mg / kg weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention . &quot;
the safety and effectiveness of a sole Bol@@ us @-@ Gab@@ e of angi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
&quot; if this value is short@@ ened ( ACT after 5 minutes ) to under 225 seconds , a second bolt lo@@ wer@@ ed from 0,@@ 3 mg / kg / body weight . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the appearance lower ACT values , it should be carefully mixed and dil@@ uted drugs in front of the application carefully mixed and the Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis rapidly ri@@ dden in@@ ven@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , a further monitoring is no longer required , provided that 1,@@ 75 mg / kg In@@ fu@@ sion@@ sd@@ osis is correct . &quot;
&quot; in patients with medium @-@ heavy kidney disease ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , who treated one PCI ( whether with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din against AC@@ S or not ) , should be a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; is the ACT @-@ value below 225 seconds , is a second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis of 0.3 mg / kg to administ@@ er and the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate growth , which conducted in phase I@@ I@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which conducted the ACT value 5 minutes after Gab@@ e des Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without dos@@ ing adap@@ table on average of 366 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 In patients with severe kid@@ neys ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also for dial@@ y@@ se@@ ful patients is angi@@ ox con@@ tra@@ index@@ ed ( see under section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with angi@@ ox can be initi@@ ated by 30 minutes after the end of the intra@@ ven@@ ous Gab@@ e of un@@ fr@@ ac@@ tionary Gi@@ arin or 8 hours after the end of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous Gab@@ e from the molecular hep@@ arin .

patients are carefully observed during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of a blood of blood especially if bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is administ@@ ered in combination with another anti @-@ ag@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; even if with PCI patients suffering from Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din may occur most ble@@ eding to arter@@ ial points , patients who occur themselves to per@@ cut@@ aneous Cor@@ on@@ ar@@ intervention ( PCI ) , during the treatment in principle all ble@@ eding . &quot;
&quot; in patients , the war@@ far@@ in use and can be treated with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , should be considered to ensure that the value of the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din will again be achieved before the treatment existing level . &quot;
&quot; starting from the knowledge of the Wir@@ km@@ echan@@ ism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ zi@@ en ( Hep@@ arin , War@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tic or thro@@ mb@@ zy@@ ten@@ agg@@ reg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) can be understood that these agents increase the ble@@ eding . &quot;
in the combination of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din with the symbol@@ ism of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din and antibodies are the clinical and biological hem@@ mo@@ st@@ as@@ ep@@ ar@@ ties in any case regularly control .

&quot; both in the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din Group as well as in the co@@ um@@ arin treatment groups , there were more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years more common to un@@ wanted events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
serious ble@@ eding were defined according to the A@@ cu@@ ity and TI@@ MI measures for heavy ble@@ eding as in the foot@@ notes of table 2 .
both light and heavy ble@@ eding can be found significantly less often than in the groups with Hep@@ arin plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / I@@ I@@ I@@ b in@@ hibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ Dru@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / I@@ I@@ I@@ a- In@@ hibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .

Ap@@ id@@ ra is used to treat adults , young people and children from six years with diabetes who need a treatment with insul@@ in . &quot;
Ap@@ id@@ ra is sub@@ cut@@ ted ( under the skin ) into the abdom@@ inal wall , the thig@@ h or the upper @-@ arm inj@@ ected or as a per@@ in@@ fusion with a insul@@ in pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not have enough insul@@ in to control the glu@@ co@@ es@@ pi@@ eg@@ els ( sugar ) in the blood or cannot process the insul@@ in .
In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in is very slightly different from Human@@ insul@@ in and the change means that it affects faster and a shorter impact of human beings has as a short pot@@ ent human@@ insul@@ in .
Ap@@ id@@ ra was investig@@ ated in combination with a long @-@ effective insul@@ in in patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes in which the body can no insul@@ in in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years .
&quot; with type @-@ 2 diabetes , in which the body of insul@@ in cannot be effective , Ap@@ id@@ ra was investig@@ ated in a study with 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indi@@ c@@ ator of the effectiveness was the change of concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ m@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that is di@@ pped as well the blood sugar .
in the first study with type @-@ 1 diabetes after six months a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.7 % to 7.7 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insul@@ in lis@@ ca .
&quot; in adults with type @-@ 2 diabetes the reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration 0,@@ 46 % after six months with Ap@@ id@@ ra compared to 0,@@ 30 % in human Nor@@ mal@@ ine . &quot;
Ap@@ id@@ ra should not be applied to patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insul@@ in l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or any of the ingredients are suffering from a hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ tic leu@@ k@@ emia .
the dos@@ es of Ap@@ id@@ ra may be adjusted when it comes along with a number of other drugs that can affect the blood circulation .
September 2004 the European Commission held the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH is a licence for the inver@@ t@@ ying Ap@@ id@@ ra in the entire European Union .

&quot; any change of the efficiency , the trademark ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , the In@@ sul@@ int@@ yp@@ s ( normal , n@@ ph , z@@ inc@@ ub@@ ates etc . ) , the type of insul@@ in ( animal insul@@ in ) and / or the manufacturer method can draw a change in the insul@@ in . &quot;
&quot; 3 A in@@ sufficient dosage , or the quar@@ ry of treatment , especially in patients with a insul@@ in char@@ geable diabetes , can lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emic and di@@ ab@@ etic che@@ que ; these conditions are potential @-@ threat@@ ening . &quot;
the conversion of a patient to another In@@ sul@@ int@@ ype or a insul@@ in another manufacturer should take place under strict knowledge and may be made possible to change the dosage .
the time of occurr@@ ence of a hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia depends on the real profile of the used insul@@ in and can therefore be changed at re@@ position of the treatment schem@@ as .

In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a double as fast drug occurr@@ ing as norm@@ ative medicine in and gets the complete dis@@ sol@@ ving effect about 2 hours earlier than human insul@@ in .
&quot; the data was obvious that in an application of insul@@ in l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ al gly@@ ca@@ emic control is achieved such as human norm@@ ality , which is given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
