<seg id="5">"B. Shres thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or vision of things which are not available), mistrust and madrigation; • Bipolar disorder, in which the patients lack of episodes (periods) alternating with periods of normal mood."</seg>
<seg id="6">"Abilify becomes the treatment of moderate to severe severe episodes, and for the prevention of manic episodes in patients who have addressed in the past to the medicine used in the past."</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is applied to the fast control of staged unrest or behaviors if the orale intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both diseases, the solution to the one or the melting tabletins are applied to patients with the scure of tablets difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="9">"patients who are taking other drugs at the same time as Abilify, the dosage should be adjusted by Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this affects the signals between brain cells through" neurotransmitters, "i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiecrezol has probably works mainly as a "partial Agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazol like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in less dimensions than the neurotransmitters work to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"as dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is a role playing, the activity of the brain contributes to normalise, causing psychotic or manic symptoms."</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent the renunciation of symptoms, was investigated in three studies over up to one year. "</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies at 805 patients with both schizophrenia or similar diseases that are compared to a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, Abilify has been stabilized on twelve weeks to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the effectiveness of Abilify and placebo, in which the lack of symptoms were already stabilized with Abilify symptoms."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered from Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies the transformation of the patient has been investigated using a standard skala for bipolar disorder, or the number of patients who spoke to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also carried out studies by investigate how the body is able to take the melting tabs and the solution to locate (rising).</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the two studies with the injection solution showed patients, the Abilify in doses of 5,25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg received a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms."</seg>
<seg id="21">The application for the treatment of bipolar disorder reduced Abilify in four of the five short-term studies of more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify prevailed up to 74 weeks long effective than placebo in previously treated patients with previously treated patients and if it was in addition to an existing treatment last.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg-cans are also more effective than placebo the symptoms, unrest and were similar effectively like Lorazepam."</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidale disturbances (hearty), nervousness, swelling (heartbeat), vomiting, nautical (heartbeat), vomiting, naughtlessness, Insomniotic."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee on Humanists (CHMP) succeeded in the conclusion that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and of moderate to severe manic episodes associated with Bipolar-I-Disorder as well as in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who were mostly manic episodes in the treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the Committee came to the result that the benefits of injection solution at the fast control of disturbing unrest and behavioral disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in Bipolar-I disorder, if a orale therapy is not suitable to prevail over the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">June 2004 the European Commission for the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a licence for the invertying of Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is shown to treat moderate to severe manic episodes of Bipolar disorder and for prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mostly manic episodes associated with Aripiprazol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a reduction dose of 15 mg / day independent of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased effectiveness in doses on a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combinations therapy (see section 5.1). "</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar-i- disorder in patients of age 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the larger sensitivity of this patient group should be considered a lower initials if clinical factors should justify this justify (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4-Inductor is derived from the combinations therapy, the Aripiprazol dosage should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">The appearance of suicide diseases belongs to psychotic disorders and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an anti-psychotic therapy (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of a epidemiological study demonstrated that in patients with bipolar disorder there is no elevated suicide rate with Aripiprazol compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripiprazol should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease, phurous disease, hypoetic disorders, hypoemia (dehydration), hypoemia (dehydration) or hypertension (including aczelerized and maligne form)."</seg>

<seg id="49">"the H2-Antagonist Famotiine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazol, whereby this effect is not relevant to clinically."</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical trial with healthy promoters a high effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) the Auc of Aripiprazol around 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected to expect other highly effective inhibitors from CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects and therefore should contain similar dosing productions."</seg>
<seg id="52">With CYP2D6 'bad' (= 'poor') Metabolisierers can result the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher Plasmaconzentrationen as compared to CYP2D6 extensiven metabolites.</seg>
<seg id="53">"if one draws the common gift from Ketoconazole or other high-effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefits should be the potential risks to the patient."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV-proteasedhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore should contain similar dosing productions."</seg>

<seg id="57">"in clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazol per day does not have significant effect on the metabolic of the substrate of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan / 3-methxymorphinan-Ratio), 2C19 (Warfartin), 2C19 (Wareprazol) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphan)."</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be saved to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or maintaining a pregnancy during the treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="59">"due to the insufficient data base for the safety when humans and due to the creation studies in the animal studies, this medicine should not be used in pregnancy, unless the potential benefits clearly justifies the potential risk for the foetus."</seg>
