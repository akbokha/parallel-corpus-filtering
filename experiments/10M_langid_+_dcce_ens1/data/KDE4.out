&quot; the package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . despite its small size , they provide some additional functions and simpli@@ fy the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &quot;
more information about using &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in features can be found in the manual &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ;
&quot; to load this modules in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to load , select settings extensions .... opening the map tools and choose the desired module . &quot;
&quot; this is a list of standard settings from the package KDE ; add @-@ ons , please note that might have more modules on your system , if you have additional software installed . &quot;
&quot; you should install the package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains , before you comp@@ ile this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the cr@@ ash module , click in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on extr@@ as Ab@@ st@@ eries . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to the cr@@ ash , if available , delete . &quot;
the module alignment ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu top@@ bar under extr@@ as attachments . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
&quot; to use the DO@@ M design in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to use Extr@@ as DO@@ M tree , and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the document , example : document@@ aries , all other kn@@ ots are sub@@ elements of this throw . &quot;
the module &amp; fs@@ view ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view of objects with the M@@ IME type ino@@ de / directory for local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different tool@@ bar and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
&quot; the pec@@ uli@@ arity of &amp; fs@@ view ; consists of a called Tree @-@ Map graph@@ ically set with the help of a so called Tree @-@ Map graph@@ ically . each object is shown by a rect@@ angle , whose area is propor@@ tional to its size . this size must possess the property of the sizes of sub@@ ordin@@ ate objects of an object smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; fs@@ view ; reflects the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries is defined . therefore , it can be easily recognized when they can be seen below in the folder hier@@ archy , as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you can be seen . &quot;
in &amp; fs@@ view ; is an entry in the Tre@@ p display a rect@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your fil@@ es@@ ystem . to the easi@@ est navigation possess the rect@@ angles mean@@ ing@@ ful color@@ less and printable settings .
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle , which is swit@@ ched on the view of color mode , can be either depth for light detection of the conspir@@ acy or the picture of another file &apos;s name such as name , owner , group or M@@ IME type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can set up with the various properties of the corresponding file or the folder . for each property , you may define whether there is enough space available to display or whether the area of sub@@ ordin@@ ance can occur ) . then , you can specify the relative position of the cap@@ tion in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; with destiny algorith@@ ms for tre@@ em@@ es@@ eed , the area is propor@@ tional to the size of the entry . it will not always be kept , and this framework will not always be kept . note that less space is lost for the frame if the rect@@ angle is square . &quot;
&quot; as the division of an item for the sub@@ ordin@@ ate entries is done , the implementation remains committed to the label and to avoid mis@@ sil@@ ently the surfaces to arise such as quadr@@ atic are possible . the best methods of this respect are lines , sp@@ old or recur@@ sive branches . &quot;
&quot; you can set the minimal area for an entry on the menu entry point , instead of indicate a room pattern into the area of the ordered order , to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an sub@@ ordin@@ ate entry . &quot;
&quot; originally , &amp; fs@@ view ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map widgets , which was developed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind . &quot;

&quot; so &amp; D came ; contains a fast image processing of basic processing tools . you can use these to assess your photos , comment , to rate and correct . the processing capacity can be easily extended with KDE image plugins Interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; D came ; easy to use , it provides sil@@ tz@@ ating professional skills at your disposal . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit farms and all available modules support the conversion by li@@ bra@@ w , DNG @-@ Export and ICC @-@ color@@ wo@@ und workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with considerably more met@@ ad@@ ata , how &amp; eg ; on the camera or the lens , which can be sought after . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; KDE ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ tization ; an open source project . that means , it is intended to support the end of the end@@ aries . you should therefore report problems and improvement . &quot;
&amp; D came to make the mil@@ den of problems or suggestions for them as easy as possible for them . where you will always find the help menu or wishes .... This is a dialogue with a under@@ lined link . all required information is available here . just follow the instructions to send your account .
&quot; so that &apos;s a project which is supported by a community . i.e. , the user and developer will help each other . if you would like to join a regular user of &amp; D . if you would like to join a regular user of &amp; D ; and hopefully soon we would like to answer any questions by other users . in this mail@@ ing list , you should always have any questions . in this mail@@ ing list , you should therefore be powerful . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ tization ; homepage visit to know news about shared versions and other information about &amp; D .
the best start to get involved and digi@@ tis@@ ed ; to participate in the developer mail@@ ing list . guidance to be written in the developer mail@@ ing@@ list of &amp; D came ; .
&quot; if you start &amp; D arrived ; for the first time you are asked , where you want your images and your database . you can simply specify a local , remote or remote folder . enter the folder folder icon to select a folder . &quot;
in the second box you have to specify a local folder on your computer . here the data will be saved . this path remains the same for all the pictures .
&quot; later you can add a lot of folder as you like to add . &amp; D came , you will also use as Al@@ ben@@ chmark . settings to K@@ AM &quot;
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder , the pictures also contains as bas@@ est@@ ner . &amp; D came ; consi@@ ders any sub@@ folder as an album . no image will be changed . during the search of the folder you get a progress report as these can be seen : &quot;
&amp; digi@@ tis@@ ed ; he was looking for recur@@ si@@ vely the libr@@ arian fa@@ d throughout the depth . you can do not include sub@@ folder , unless it &apos;s in hidden folder . this allows you to insert a point in front of the name of the folder . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as a basic folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ ches have no photos as symbols . you can change the by using a any photo from the album and this will be used as Alb@@ um@@ symbol . further details can be found in the section albums . &quot;
&quot; once you configure the bas@@ est@@ ner you can set up in &amp; D , you can learn to set up your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to manage My albums and My keyword , to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; data handling : if you use the raw mode of your camera , so you can also handle . the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out whether a special camera is supported , so you will find a list of supported Roh@@ k@@ amer@@ as in the menu help g@@ amer@@ a@@ assistance . &quot;

&quot; one easy to use camer@@ ash@@ board will be available to you , so that you can connect with your digital camera and your photos directly in &amp; D ; -@@ Alb@@ ums can be supported by means of the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and any card reader , which is supported by your operating system , with &amp; digi@@ coming ; together . &quot;
modern digital cameras are registered by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory card and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . the camera can also be realized through the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its der@@ iv@@ atives . older cameras can also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; now , the program was developed g@@ Photo@@ 2 for communication with digital cameras , which is an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras suppor@@ ters g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the transfer of images of digital cameras , which developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images of digital cameras to invo@@ ices and other peri@@ pher@@ als without the need additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . as photos in general are obsolete . &amp; D came , this connection has now been obsolete . &amp; D came , supports this cameras and guides the transmission of the images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link . &quot;
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must be read with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support has been able to read the thumb@@ nails of digi@@ tization . if the Exif support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the Exif support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might not be imag@@ ery , or the generation might be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things to &amp; D came ; is how easy to extend his functionality thanks to modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I @-@ Module : the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a shared module structure for &amp; D ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . target is to provide the modules for all graphics program@@ med . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manip@@ ulate images in virtually any way as it can also have a user . your advantage is that it &apos;s much easier , &amp; D came ; by writing a small module to complement one function as the changes in &amp; D came ; even perform . &quot;
&quot; to simpli@@ fy the window , you can either remove the page with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to the full screen mode with F@@ 11 or Ctr@@ l + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; the pull and dra@@ fting of pictures works everywhere : you can take a picture in another part of the tree @-@ tree , above the horizontal separ@@ ating line or into another application window . the only restric@@ tion is that a picture is not included in keywords , stat@@ ues or search . &quot;

&quot; I d@@ are to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you do not even know how many photos you have , then you do not want to know how many photos you have , then use it a quick search and a secure archi@@ ving to you with other programs , platforms and formats freely . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you do and need to know exactly what you want to create in your system is the construction information structure , as opposed to the data structure . your images must somehow be saved on your computer , whether you need to save them on a reser@@ vo@@ id drive or on a net@@ worked station &amp; etc ; make sure you need to switch to a bigger drive . &quot;
&quot; perhaps you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can quickly be found in one year several times at the same place . if you have enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folder like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; use . export is then a folder for images you want to print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; Professional photographer have different requirements like Ver@@ sion@@ ing of photos , archi@@ ving , work@@ flows , constant feed of pictures on different themes and a large number of all . within 10 years are 95 % archives and 5 % files . you will not plan your structure for this content . &quot;
which types of files fit together ? the separation of data types makes the st@@ acking processing simp@@ ler . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know whether you are looking for a original or a der@@ iv@@ ative image .
we also recommend the option Metad@@ ata store in the Settings @-@ site of the met@@ ad@@ ata in &amp; D . this makes sure that ex@@ if@@ - and IP@@ TC data stored in the file you can save the met@@ ad@@ ata from the database in the file by selecting the corresponding option in the menu album .
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what you want to change ? then there is a met@@ ad@@ ata Editor for a number of selected attri@@ butes . these are of course the most important ones . &quot;
&quot; now , the real work , since you should now select any photo keywords , cap@@ tions and an assessment . of course you can choose the same attribute and value then . you start the best with the rating or the rank . this makes sense as you can focus on the best photos . &quot;
&quot; let us know now with keywords , keywords , as you are often continuing with other programs or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same cause . &quot;
if you import kat@@ alog@@ ized images from another source with embedded samp@@ lers ; then the tree of hier@@ archy within the tree is no problem and can simply be done by selecting a sub@@ tree on another . the changed keyword ( words are pursu@@ ed by &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ed ; updated during the sub @-@ trees .
&quot; the graphic shows how different met@@ ad@@ ata over@@ cut . this is a very large representation , since each block of met@@ ad@@ ata exists in truth from many sections . filename and calendar data features all pictures . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third major tool to cat@@ ching your met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; they do not want to see most of anyone to see your photos simply , they want to share them with your friends , your family , other phot@@ ographers and agencies . they are certainly interested in your photos . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then catch some details to see people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I say to you this of the Lan@@ de@@ place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Norman@@ dy 60 years after land@@ ing is . wow ! one begins to dream , associations , the historical time period is again present , you may even hear the silence . the label has completely changed your perception of this panoramic view . &quot;
&quot; for others who consider your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to tell you . remember , the key is to help you think about the mot@@ if you have moved to understand what you understand . &quot;
it is fine if a picture is not perfect when it has the strength to work only with an cap@@ tion for itself alone .
&quot; with &amp; D so , you can store any amount of text , in an internation@@ alised alphab@@ et . KDE will even export it for a selection of pictures at the same time . KDE will even export it for a selection of pictures at the same time . KDE will even be export@@ ed to your images in the cap@@ tion and / or the title of the web @-@ group system . you have to tell you the story for the opening . &quot;
remember the times before GPS ? as you had to find in another city without navigation system ? did they find Earth not a boring planet from G@@ oogle@@ Earth ? good because with pictures the train of sp@@ atial presentation is already with lighting speed .
&quot; the possibilities use the Ge@@ ol@@ ocation , and are already ob@@ tain@@ able in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can repeat the pictures with ge@@ ographic data . it can also export k@@ ml files , you can also export k@@ ml files by images with ge@@ ographic data . it can also export k@@ ml files . it can also export k@@ ml files , Flick@@ r &amp; etc ; with the G@@ oogle@@ Maps viewer . &quot;
&amp; quot ; Copy@@ left is a voc@@ ational with copyright and means the practice to use copyright rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same freedoms are also valid in all modified versions as well as for the work of others .
the following description tells you what information is available in the setup page of &amp; D ; if information should be depos@@ ited :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for Er@@ ts and Writ@@ er ) : this field should add your name , or the name of the person who has been created , e.g. by the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organisation cannot be modified . this field does not support summ@@ mas nor semi@@ col@@ ons as separ@@ ators . &quot;
title ( syn@@ onym for dis@@ closure ) : linked to the author . this field contains the working conditions of the photographer . examples of such as : employee photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent photographer . since this is an accident to the author of the photographer , this must also be filled out . &quot;
&quot; publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider to identify who the photo . this does not necessarily be the author . if the photographer can be listed here , then this organizations can be listed here . if the picture is a bearing photo , then here the group will provide the picture here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this is no protection against abuse . each of which a little more than basic knowledge in the work with calcul@@ ators can only delete or change . the solution for this problem are digital water@@ mark . for professionals and Hal@@ f pro@@ s this protection is very important . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is one picture unique . &amp; D came ; will provide such a module for for@@ kli@@ fts in the near future .

&quot; of course , we do not talk about CDs that can happen on the street or a fire . these types of losses are so that they can also happen to you with traditional paper size or neg@@ atives . in this section it is about problems with the so called New Media . &quot;
&quot; Kro@@ ll On@@ track , the biggest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics which reasons are a data loss . &quot;
&quot; to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , this will need to be treated with CDs and DVDs in archive . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive . there are offers about Gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece which is a lifetime of 100 years for itself . whether you think that is in your discretion . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD disc@@ s can be un@@ read@@ able , but you can use this risk in which you use good disc@@ s and good recording . the best DVD Ripper are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable . it is therefore about the right balance . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to faul@@ ts , even if you just have just written . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we needed for the form@@ att@@ ing and control summ@@ ers . despite this massive protection they need for chemical ag@@ eing , Ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust , etc . &quot;
&quot; for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs , there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster , that apparently no wonder when CDs and DVDs are available . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but there is also similar applications the cor@@ rupted data of cor@@ rupted dis@@ ks , hard@@ disk drives , Flash@@ media , USB @-@ drives etc . &quot;
Optical Media : Blu @-@ ray disc@@ s seem to win the Format@@ war against the HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disk can store 50 GB and therefore almost six@@ ty the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all about CDs and DVDs was also valid for the Blu @-@ ray disk .
&quot; burn slowly with a good recording quality on high quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ etary format . you also read the data using a description , date &amp; author Screen and then protected from animals protected site . don &apos;t forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read this media . &quot;
&quot; Disk@@ Manufacturer will keep your statistics for themselves . your manufacturer include a new disk , but not the data . Google puts a major field study on the error @-@ mechanical mechanisms of dis@@ ks : disco@@ graphy study &quot;
&quot; soon , Dis@@ ks hold the lon@@ gest when you are operated in the temper@@ ate area of 35 ° C up to 45 ° C . at lower temper@@ ate . electronic parts of Contro@@ ll@@ ers are the most common error @-@ cause , SMAR@@ T cannot determine these errors . some of the SMAR@@ T fixed mistakes . these are in particular reading and shift . the expected life @-@ time amounts between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; this only involves the complete ver@@ lu@@ ste due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to a black@@ out before you have secured the files , but these losses can normally produce without great problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electrical devices black@@ outs does not make a lot of damage resulting in equipment with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes , you can cause serious harm , hard@@ ships , destroyed motherboards , and other def@@ ects . defend yourself in front of the un@@ avo@@ id@@ able that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; the most widespread protection against black@@ tips is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that is absor@@ bed a part of the energy surface , but it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in . do not think any so@@ ckets is also included in the form of a so@@ ckets . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should pay attention to UL 1449 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also pay attention to protect the protection against light@@ ning bolt and thus protects the right connected devices . &quot;
&quot; as an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should consider that also all peri@@ pher@@ als are connected to your system . some manufacturers are also connected to your modem . others provide a telephone connection for your modem . others provide connectivity for the co@@ ax cables of cable @-@ mo@@ dem@@ s and the TV @-@ card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , then you will need an portable handle protection . a variety of these devices are specially designed for not@@ ebooks and therefore also contain the protection for the modem . thus , you are ideal for travel . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection , your system will not really help you with a complete loss . even a failure of few seconds can lead to loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful in a reason@@ abl@@ eness @-@ free power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the protection against over@@ voltage , these devices will automatically be able to save your data and the system allows you to keep up your data to store . if you have an US@@ V , then you should be sure to ensure the same quality requirements like an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the underlying software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; raise the potential risk that is exposed to your computer system and compare its security for prevention of this . a high quality over@@ voltage protection can be up to € &amp; euro ; 40 . this is only a small price difference , you may consider how well you get your computer with it . finally , you should always think all the cable before you go into the holidays . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple memory service . with the right configuration you can use this as a device under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to save this as backup goal for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is a further arbit@@ r@@ ary offer with which you can store any number of data . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to the hard@@ disk home , however very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . furthermore , you have to send the data using the compar@@ atively slow Internet . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the solutions are therefore only as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . it is not too slow . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flick@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the Photo @-@ Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com put online storage services that are available on pictures . their free memory is available on 1 GB and you will not get your pictures in full resolution online . &quot;
from the point of view of the data protection are the web solutions very secure . transmission methods are automatically det@@ ected by the TCP protocol and with the large number of companies in the offer is a backup and a distributed memory . thus they are dis@@ ast@@ er@@ safe .
the diagram illustr@@ ate the elements of the transmission line in the computer . all transfers are pr@@ one for transfer@@ ring mistake . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs provide at least the data @-@ inclusive between operating system and hard disk .
&quot; the worst thing is that no one says , if this is happening in your hardware . all these disorders remain un@@ discovered that it should not be destroyed in your computer . nobody seems to have thought of it . no one seems to be thought of it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much saf@@ er data path than that in your computer . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable power parts are another source of transfer@@ ring values , as they create inter@@ ference within the data flows . in normal fil@@ esystem@@ s , these errors will remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are not especially affected by transfer@@ able problems , you should look into the future . &quot;
Z@@ FS from Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who are able to deal with turn@@ tables at low level and is available under a GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is soon available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows available . read this article in English .
&quot; oracle has started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ es@@ ystem . this is still in alpha status . it is still used in alpha Status . it is used for &amp; Linux , but is not part of the kernel . &quot;
under@@ estimate this not ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data losses for the not@@ ebook and 46 % in the work@@ space systems . if not@@ ebooks are already the proportion of the theft of 50 % .
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most likely think . it leads to a lower damage , such as theft or re@@ install@@ ments . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know only very few viruses and under Linux ; has long been no longer sight@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss as propri@@ etary systems : wrong , N@@ TF@@ S is minimal better than EX@@ T3 , travel , J@@ FS and XF@@ S to call the widespread file systems . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling @-@ file systems prevent cor@@ rupt data and data loss : incor@@ rect , only the speed of the examination process during a operation is higher and an inde@@ fin@@ alized status will be avo@@ ided . if a file has not been completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
viruses are the main threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human mistakes are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
sensors from Dig@@ ital@@ k@@ amer@@ as are 1 @-@ 2 blocks of fundamental physical limits . char@@ ms is that while the technology develops there is a natural border for this progress . sensitivity and space characteristic for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go in the direction of 10 Meg@@ api@@ x@@ el@@ sensors . even if this resolution is already det@@ eri@@ or@@ ated for compact cameras and the result results are rather det@@ eri@@ or@@ ated for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras did your limit at 10 @-@ 12 Meg@@ api@@ xel . for higher resol@@ utions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
&quot; a 750@@ GB hard disk drive you today for 100 &amp; euro , so do not make any other responsibility for data ver@@ lu@@ ste . 6 % of all PCs are concerned about a plan and test this backup before you make any more dangerous as the re@@ installing of your operating system , the exchange of plates or the size of hard dis@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; supp@@ ose daily your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a light@@ ning pro@@ poses , you are lucky if the drive was not connected to the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster pro@@ poses locally and destroyed a lot . forget aircraft : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough . you usually concern a whole room or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Des@@ ast@@ er@@ ug@@ ging does not always mean a local storage . bring your f@@ uses the stair@@ case , into the neighbor@@ ing house , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of the physical separation : as above mentioned , is a common reason for a data loss despite sec@@ uring the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files will be secured . it is a snapshot without history and presents a complete copy at a time .
differenti@@ ation : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete ass@@ urance . generates a complete snapshot regarding two periods of time : the complete ass@@ urance and the last differ@@ ential damage .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . you can restore the original status at any time . this sec@@ uring is done with the exception that it is only depos@@ ited and not continuously .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . as opposed to script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer@@ ring script only the difference of files that is really changed . this is comp@@ ressed and if you want to increase security over ss@@ h .
secure important pictures right after you saved them on your computer to a DVD or another Optical medium .
&quot; this approach will show you enough time to discover losses and restore it . at the end , you will have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . each additional th@@ inner should be done manually after which you have made a complete check . &quot;
&quot; topics : met@@ ad@@ ata , in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , Associ@@ ated X@@ MP files , original , storage , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ viewing images and met@@ ad@@ ata , cop@@ ying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , visu@@ alization , ... , use of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; to make valuable pictures the next 40 year that is about the time period in which you really are interested in you , because they remember your child@@ hood and youth , there are two strategies that should be observed : &quot;
&quot; as the future because of your nature is un@@ predic@@ table , you have to look at all what is said today . unfortunately , there is no other possibility to consider using caution . unfortunately , there is no other option than the current system are back@@ wards . &quot; the less variations you have in the past , which is easier to assess the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications .
&quot; virtu@@ alization is now available for everyone . if you have an old system that is important to read your images , then keep it on and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and guarantee technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the expert pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size . this is actually always enlarge .
let us choose from that you have the scal@@ ability with one planned and the area you would like to enlarge the area you want to copy on a dedicated plate or partition . for * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; allows you to copy this domain and shift to a new record :
&quot; check with the command d@@ mes@@ g , whether your new record has been recognized from the system , but do not hang them . &quot;
&amp; dollar ; d@@ d if = / dev / sd@@ b &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / S@@ DC # source is / dev / sd@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the plate in MB@@ s ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ m 1 # change the size of rei@@ ser@@ fs if needed &quot;
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software you can read it then you can create it . this task is easier by year to year .
&quot; GIF is a propri@@ etary , pat@@ ented format that is slow down from the market . you should not use it anymore . &quot;
&quot; PNG has been developed as an open source standard in the GIF , but it can store much more . it is distributed , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC Metad@@ ata , 16 @-@ bit per color@@ less and full transparency . PNG can produce gam@@ ma@@ - and chro@@ mati@@ cal data for improved colour@@ ants , but not as many as TIFF needed and a slow Combi repres@@ sion . this format we would like to save you for stor@@ ing your images . &quot;
&quot; TIFF was widely used as image format . TIFF can be stored in un@@ comp@@ ressed form or in a container with a ver@@ lu@@ st@@ less comp@@ ression @-@ bi@@ d@@ ash ( DE@@ FLA@@ TE ) . a problem is however , that this format is adapted to many people . there is no more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types . &quot;
&quot; DNG The digi@@ tization of negative file format is a licence @-@ free and appar@@ ent raw format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and committed to the use of met@@ ad@@ ata . a hand@@ ful camera works has now been available and we hope to use the competitors for Canon and Nikon . &quot;
&quot; this may be one of the reasons why to replace 2001 , Adobe its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology , a combination of XML and R@@ DF . it is a combination of XML and R@@ DF . it is a combination of XML and R@@ DF . it is a combination of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many phot@@ ographers draw it in front of the original format , mostly in the format , to archi@@ ving . X@@ MP will also be saved with the connection between the met@@ ad@@ ata file and the image file . therefore , you should think whether you use DNG as a container and everything there . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to the activities of D@@ CM@@ I communities and the activities of D@@ CM@@ I communities , and collabor@@ ative work in the D@@ CM@@ I communities and workshops , standard conferences and workshops , standard connections and workshops , at@@ tain@@ able efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of met@@ ad@@ ol@@ ards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import images from the camera , the Card@@ reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures on the camera files , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files by DNG and save it in your Ro@@ har@@ chi@@ v . this function is not yet implemented .
&quot; for a subtle processing , you can use external programs . if you want to edit the pictures again with &amp; D , then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata again . these were cut out by the other programs . &quot;
&quot; use the modified images for the copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export it only in web @-@ gal@@ eries , using in MPEG , use you in contact sheets , print and etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; D , you can get a description on how you can add photos , which you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to import it from images to your album . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; D , then connect them to the machine , turn off the camera on the scor@@ o@@ dus and turn it . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; if you start the camera interface it is trying to connect with your camera . when this is the connection , the filename and the thumb@@ nails will appear on the camera . some cameras are not displayed , the filename and a symbol for the file extension for each file , photos , movies , music etc. on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information about any entry . with the si@@ deb@@ ates properties and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; this dialog shows file properties and the photo information to be stored intern@@ ally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that at some digital cameras do not have any information available . &quot;
&quot; the rider met@@ ad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ ad@@ ata as Exif , producer , GPS etc. of the image . this information is the same as at the met@@ ad@@ ata side bar from the main window of &amp; D ; or the image processing . note that these met@@ ad@@ ata is not available with some digital cameras . &quot;
the easi@@ est way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button Download and then select the selection from all of the camera in a single album in &amp; D ; . when downloading the photos were not deleted and we recommend it to review whether the pictures can safely delete it from the camera before you delete the photos of the camera .
&quot; if you do not want to download all photos using the standard method methods of &amp; KDE . as soon as you selected the photos , use the button Download and then download selected . the kno@@ ck@@ chosen download is as long as you have selected . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , a option New download is available . these pictures were not yet registered by &amp; D . in this case the new pictures have been marked with a star in the preview of window . if you choose this option , of course only the new images are downloaded . &quot;
&quot; if you use the buttons all download or download it , a dialog with which you can select the target album , displayed in which the photos may appear . the list of existing albums will be displayed in the section My albums . then select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after which you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; D came ; invites the photos of the camera into the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete it from the camera . you can delete all of your camera by using the button Clear All . if you just want to delete some of you , then you have to delete it and then delete the chosen . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no possibility to restore photos , which you have been deleted from the camera before you delete it . you should not delete it from the camera before you delete it from the camera . if you want to delete it from the camera . in case you want to delete it from the camera . if you want to delete the camera files , as this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; cameras are used as a filename for the photos often not especially pron@@ ounc@@ ed names . this can normally download photos from the camera , if you can upload photos of different recording in the same album . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and the time in which the picture was made to integrate into the filename . &quot;
in the next section you will find options for rot@@ ating and mirr@@ ors of the image and for dat@@ ating sub@@ menus . if you use this latter option is automatically created a folder per day .
&quot; the options Dur@@ ing the transmission will open three more options that are performed before the photographs on the record will be saved . if you can select the respective entries into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct a date &amp; time for any downloaded images . &quot;
&quot; if you wish to use a different file format than the default format , you can use the Pre@@ fix Photo@@ - % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . switch to the option date &amp; time for further adjust@@ ments you should read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time . &quot;
&quot; if you use the option camera filename , you have the option to change the filename in small letters . or in large letters , if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new filename , the &amp; D came ; for a photo will be shown below the name will be displayed below . your settings for ren@@ ame will be saved and automatically used if you open the next time the camera window . &quot;
&quot; for example , all of the information about orientation of the camera do not use to perform a automatic fil@@ ming during the set of time . not all cameras will provide you with more details about the information that embedded your camera into the photo . &quot;
&quot; the automatic fil@@ ming is normally activated , and when your camera does not provide this information , lets you want to turn out the original rotation . if you want to switch the automatic fil@@ ming , use the button and select the automatic rotation in the lower range of the window . &quot;
&quot; when your camera has been made available via the date , at which the photo can be made available to the photo . all images of the same dates are loaded in the target . not all cameras are available in the same basement . not all cameras are available in the same basement . not all cameras are available in the same basement . in the section tool@@ bar Meta @-@ data you can refer to which information you have embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is normally off , and in this case store &amp; D came to change ; the photos right next to the target . if you want to change this option , you will need to install this option and select the option Dat@@ asheets at the bottom of the window . &quot;
the easi@@ est way photos of their computer to load their camera is the button Download . select then up@@ loading . you can then choose up@@ loading . you can also select files that you are to select files . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; KDE ; methods .
&quot; after the image is done , asks &amp; D came ; you where the pictures will be loaded up . select a folder dialog for the camera . select here the desired folder and press OK to load the up@@ loading . the pictures will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
GPS ( Global Position@@ ing System ) is used as a general term in this document . this is a position meant to be shown in length and lati@@ tude and the data can be indicated by the American GPS , the Russian GLO@@ NAS , the European Galil@@ eo or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional phot@@ ographers , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses an air@@ plane to address an area through automatic recording of GPS data . &quot;
&quot; if you have to forget , where exactly the photo was done , you can send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ lib@@ . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ed , users who want to document the place of the photo so it is good to document the position of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is how to get the GPS data into the picture ? first , you should know that exi@@ v@@ 2 many GPS data fields such as the direction , s@@ addle and map files are now available . directly with the right hardware , this is available directly with the right hardware and image files using the K@@ IP@@ I module for the geographical assignment ( manual ) and most recently on the manual entry of known locations . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there are currently no camera associated with GPS receiver . but there are a few who work with GPS receiver . either as ticket module or by transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS @-@ interface : Co@@ y@@ pen Eye i@@ pa@@ q I@@ ke Kodak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G3 Sony
downloading of the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ bab@@ el . you will need to save this data in the g@@ px format as this is the only format that is supported by the module for the geographical assignment .
there are various programs for Windows ; and Mac OS that extracts the data of images and from the GPS extract . on the following page you can extract the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itude and lati@@ tude or lati@@ tu@@ des or other data , then you can use this script using the Ex@@ if@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the signs . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ g@@ oogle.com does not show any European road cards . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&amp; D came to give you so much control over his work@@ flows . there are many at@@ titu@@ des to access their work@@ flows . there are many at@@ titu@@ des to access to these settings , you must select in the menu settings . you can choose between these settings , by clicking on the symbols of the left . &quot;
&quot; action can set up on built @-@ in Preview or image processing , so they set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ed ; fixed when you click on an entry in the main view . &quot;
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically selected in the respective IP@@ TC data fields . this data is automatically written in the IP@@ TC fields . it is also written in the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
author title is a syn@@ onym for dis@@ closure : this field should be the voc@@ al name of the photographer . this may be the professional photographer or independent , commercial photographer or independent , commercial photographer , as this is also being filled . &quot;
&quot; publisher is a syn@@ onym for suppliers : use this field to offer the photo . this does not have to be the author , then this organizations should be registered here , then the group should be included here , then the group should be available here . &quot;
the IP@@ TC actions save the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC fields . this met@@ ad@@ ata is permanently available in the database and not only in the database of &amp; D . these met@@ ad@@ ata are also available to other programs and can be import@@ ed in &amp; D .
&quot; cap@@ tions as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG pictures : this synchroni@@ zes the comments that you have to add to your photos , using the images contained in the images , which are already known to the images , which are already cap@@ tured by &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ed ; over@@ written . &quot;
the page settings contains all the options for the information that appear when the mouse window appears in the main window via a file . depending on selected option this information is indicated or not .
&amp; # 160 ; it came ; supports a number of var@@ ying images and some Video@@ - and audio formats . to set the file extension to this list and remove . each file in a &amp; digi@@ pack ; Alb@@ um@@ ord@@ ner that has no one of these extensions , by &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ed ; ignor@@ ed . &quot;
default settings can be returned again by pressing the button actu@@ alis@@ e to the right of each category .
&quot; the settings of the lumin@@ osity of &amp; D came ; can be set on this page on the default values . whenever you then use the lumin@@ ous mode . some pictures have different sizes and the syn@@ ony@@ one mode , you should only use on fast computers . if you have one , then you can get better results results . &quot;
&quot; by default the image processing a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can choose the tool@@ bar if you use the tool@@ box in full screen mode . &quot;
over@@ - and under@@ lined areas of an image can be marked with dar@@ ker or bright@@ er color in the image . these colors are specified here . in the image processing can be put in the picture @-@ box with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
&quot; with Chro@@ ma @-@ Su@@ bs@@ amp@@ ling is meant that the images are co@@ ded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in color information . please read this article in Wikipedia .
&quot; with the setting of PNG @-@ comp@@ ression , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not decrease the image quality , as PNG included a ver@@ lu@@ st@@ free algorith@@ m . the only effect is that you can put this value to a high comp@@ ression . this means 1 : a low and 9 a high comp@@ ression . &quot;
&quot; with the option TIFF files comp@@ ress you can turn the DE@@ FLA@@ TE -@@ Commission@@ er for TIFF image . this reduces the size of the TIFF image . it has no influence on the image quality , since the DE@@ F@@ TE algorith@@ m is free . &quot;
&quot; with the setting low @-@ free JPEG @-@ 2000 files you can choose to save the relationship between quality loss and is much better than the normal JPEG . when this paragraph has been written , met@@ ad@@ ata was not yet supported , but was in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in the previous versions of &amp; D , the sculp@@ tor works only a picture viewer for photos . currently , it develops very quickly to a tool to manip@@ ulation your photos . with this dialogue you can change the settings of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the default measure is that all green pixels are equal in the output . if you use this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option makes the picture a little soft , elimin@@ ated this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option makes the picture a little soft , elimin@@ ated the 2x@@ 2 handles with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD @-@ quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white screw is used as the camera . otherwise , if set , the automatic color@@ balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting will only be used if the white is not set aside . Standard is it a fixed color balance , based on a white card that was photograp@@ hed in the sun@@ light . &quot;
this setting will only be supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . the use of the second sensors has the effect that under@@ scor@@ ed pictures in four steps to get more details in the po@@ ds . for other cameras will be ignor@@ ed this option .
&quot; the standard is the pointed out , so the parts of your images are the built @-@ in , because of the inc@@ ap@@ acity of your camera shows the pointed @-@ lights . finally , you can try some parts of the missing information from the pointed out . &quot;
this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast appro@@ achable as green and red . &amp; D came ; and d@@ cra@@ w try to re@@ construct the missing blue pixels that is not a question how much color or white you want .
&quot; if you select the option , you get the possibility to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adjusted for each picture individually . &quot;
put the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ worth to your taste . you probably have to put it slightly higher than standard 1 . this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; D . this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; D . &quot;
&quot; a Dem@@ o @-@ icing algorith@@ m is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the part @-@ off data , which has many cameras and which is known as CF@@ A @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation or color @-@ construction . &quot;
&quot; and D@@ cra@@ w came to you with three alternatives : Bil@@ ear Inter@@ pol@@ ation , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adaptive Hom@@ ogen@@ eit@@ y @-@ Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorith@@ m of by D@@ cra@@ w . but as if A@@ HD @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation is interesting when you are looking for a quick solution with a acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color @-@ devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correc@@ tive values here . this is certainly the best method for a color correc@@ tion procedure , as you will be performed during the conversion . &quot;
&quot; a profile translated the color information and gives instructions how to be given back , there are also a CMS and &amp; D came to translate information such as the color information from a Far@@ br@@ aum in the other that the colors are as accurate as possible . &quot;
behaviour questions when a picture is opened in the image processing / color power module with raw material .
&quot; color profile folder can be found here the folder , such as usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .co@@ ine / ICC , in which you save all your profiles . &amp; D came ; investig@@ ated this folder then during the start . &quot;
settings of ICC @-@ Profile you have here the option &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles last . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the colour show is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures colored not the entire screen .
the input profiles should match to the camera units and model you use . not all profiles are available on the same way . there are some like Canon , which no colour ton@@ m@@ apping or g@@ amm@@ ak@@ or@@ tion . currently correc@@ ted d@@ cra@@ w Gamma is not for conver@@ sions at 16 bits depth . this means that you need to perform the colour ton@@ sil@@ apping themselves . &quot;
&quot; there are other options like the soft @-@ pro@@ of profile , with which you em@@ ul@@ ating how to print your image of a device . this is very useful before you can print a smaller color range as your camera and some colors are therefore very satur@@ ated , rather than to rely on the blin@@ ds algorith@@ m of your printer . &quot;
for most cameras it is quite obvious that suits which is intended for them . unfortunately not with the models of Canon . therefore here a table of cameras and profiles . this answer is of course in@@ officially :
&quot; the Canon profile extension can be seen the style for the target : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; KDE ; image Plugin Interface . it is an interface that is supported by a series of &amp; KDE ; image viewer , and gener@@ ating images , which were written to support with each program , which supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the ones you want to use , and these are then loaded from &amp; digi@@ pack . these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition , you can also find some also in the context menu of the board . &quot;
abbrevi@@ ations for tasks that are performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings menu .
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be accessed via the K@@ IP@@ I project on http : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ in@@ s.org or in the hand@@ books of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the settings of the slideshow should be easy to understand . the upper controller j@@ us@@ hed the time between the cap@@ tions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other anti @-@ cru@@ ise fields turn off the met@@ ad@@ ata and resulting in the lower end of the images during the display . &quot;
&quot; the camera properties show up on the left side of all the supported cameras . on the right side there is a button automatic detection , who is trying to identify a camera that is connected to the computer , enabled and in the image fire@@ o@@ dus . below are the portable , USB@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the end you can set the path for USB@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) -@@ mass storage camera from the camera . you need to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able to specify your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; D , to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , connect them into the scor@@ o@@ dus and turn off . &quot;
&quot; try out , whether &amp; D came ; the camera will automatically det@@ ect . if not , you can set up Camer@@ am@@ od@@ ell and Port manually . after you set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera camera . &quot;
&quot; you can select any design@@ ation for your camera . this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can add all here . &quot;
&quot; with the option comm@@ em@@ or@@ ating dialog for the move of &gt; pictures in the leg@@ ends , you can set the talk of &amp; D ; to delete some photos in an album . in the sections of a photo and delet@@ ing an album you will find more details . &quot;
the edi@@ torial changes by the right si@@ deb@@ ar can be imp@@ lied by &amp; D ; if you use the option to use changes in the right si@@ deb@@ ar without re @-@ ask . otherwise you need to apply the changes to the button changes .
you can also start the display of the initial screen from &amp; D ; when starting the start @-@ up . this speeds up under circumstances the start @-@ up of &amp; D came ; .
&quot; when setting up a new look for new photos , the bas@@ est@@ ner came to look for new or deleted albums / photos ; if something out of the bas@@ ec@@ ner was deleted . if something out of the bas@@ est@@ ner was deleted , promp@@ t &amp; D came , if it is clear to delete it out of the database . &quot;
different shades can be used in &amp; D ; used to suit the main window to suit your taste . these settings can choose from the tool@@ bar . a preview of available designs is shown below :
&quot; these designs are defined in simple text@@ files . if you are interested in a new design for &amp; D , you will find more information about it in this tutorial . &quot;
&amp; D came ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use these to look at your photos and to improve your photos with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the preview and selecting the entry .
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your pictures . some of them are available as modules in &amp; D ; they are not part of your distribution . further information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found in the section Settings .
&quot; a status line at the bottom of the window , the filename , current filename , enlargement factor and the current page . &quot;
a menu button on the upper edge and below the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most commonly needed functions .
the processing functions of the image processing changes your photos . no of the functions will change the original photo before you save File Save or the button stor@@ ing from the tool@@ bar . note that you can not restore the original photo as soon as you have saved the original photo .
so you should make a copy of your image before you change it . this allows you to save it with file s@@ ali@@ ans .
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original picture by using the menu File Rest@@ ore or the button of the button re@@ produce in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change that you have performed in the photo since the last save . &quot;
virtually every action of the image processing can be back@@ ed or re@@ produced . the last action you can be back@@ ed by going back re@@ warding or re@@ produced by selecting re@@ tain restor@@ es from the menu .
&quot; if you often use it frequently , you should make the keyboard short@@ cut , Ctr@@ l ; -@@ z to re@@ produce and Ctr@@ l ; -@@ Um@@ f@@ alt @-@ Z to re@@ produce . &quot;
&quot; if you want to press the &amp; L@@ MB ; over the toil@@ et@@ able or re@@ produce button in the tool@@ bar , you will get a context menu . if you choose one of the menu items , all actions are also ind@@ ented and restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started the image processing , you can move between the photos on the same album or the same title by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , image r@@ under or the entries in the menu File , you will be asked if you want to save them . &quot;
you can put into the photo and out zo@@ om@@ es in which you Ctr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the icons in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the panel menu .
&quot; to adapt a photo to the window size , you can use this kno@@ b in tool@@ bar : magni@@ fying factor automatically &quot;
view screen mode shows the photo taken in full @-@ screen mode . you will also come into normal view . if you do not want to change the tool@@ box . if you do not want to call this in Settings dialog by &amp; D . you can see this in the Settings dialog by &amp; D . you can see the section to set up the photo processing .
if you want to print the current picture you can print in the menu File and get the default &amp; KDE ; print dialog . you can custom@@ ize the settings before you print your photo .
&quot; from the main menu , you can print single pictures or whole phr@@ ases . whole image files can be printed out of your choice . you just need to select the images with the standard method and select from the menu album ex@@ por@@ celain printer . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you just need your choice to meet . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; D came ; main window has a si@@ deb@@ ar on the right edge , which provides important information and promotions for selected images . the same si@@ deb@@ ar is available without the navig@@ ational pieces , even in the image processing is available : &quot;
the layer Click on the same rider lets the si@@ deb@@ ar will appear or appear again in the edge again .
&quot; in the cap@@ tions view , you can enter cap@@ tions with unlimited size or insert . note the note below . the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 . this means that all special marks are allowed to be used in EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs . &quot;
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters and special signs are ren@@ dered to 2000 characters and special signs . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label industry in other applications you should consider these restrictions .
&quot; after you have commented , you can either use the button or switch to the next picture , the cap@@ tions will then be saved . &quot;
&quot; besides the user @-@ button , there is a button More . with this you can read further met@@ ad@@ ata from selected file or the database . however , you can also read the met@@ ad@@ ata in the files . however , this is always required if you have chosen a met@@ ad@@ ditions that is always written in the pictures . &quot;
&quot; the section assessment shows a evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in Search and sorting files . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the si@@ deb@@ ar or with the keyboard short@@ cut Ctr@@ l + 0 ... 5 , you can choose several pictures at the same time and use the context menu . &quot;
the review is written in the IP@@ TC field . the co@@ ding is followed by the sch@@ ema in the following table :
&quot; the liter@@ ary view shows a search box to the filter@@ ing of the keywords , the samp@@ lers @-@ tree and a sel@@ ector with the previously worked in this &amp; digi@@ ar ; -@@ session pro@@ claimed keywords . &quot;
the keyword @-@ tree is dynam@@ ically adapted . you can limit the number of possibilities in search of a keyword fast limit . this ability is particularly useful if you have many sample pass@@ words .
the input field at the lower end is another relief in the input of keywords on a picture series . if you have given various sample pass@@ words will be saved for quick access .
sample pass@@ words can also be set by means of the corresponding inv@@ entor fields in the tree . all the tags of a picture are stored in the IP@@ TC field keyword .
&quot; if multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword , it is only applied to the high@@ lighted picture and not displayed on the entire selection , if you want to select a selection with a keyword , please read the section keyword filter . &quot;
&quot; the si@@ deb@@ ar pl@@ orable filter is used to change the selection of the displayed items with their album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , keywords liter@@ ary and sear@@ ches . if additionally one or more keyword filter will be used , only the inter@@ section of these two are displayed . all created keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also drag and draw . supp@@ ose you have selected several pictures in the main view . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it out of the right si@@ deb@@ ar and click on the selection . then , you can simply put it out of the right side bar and click on the selection . then you &apos;ll ask if you want to put the keyword . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example shows the main window of the pictures at a cal@@ ender day . the keyword filter is shown on No keywords , what the amount shown on three images . they were drawn with Ctr@@ l + a , and after that it was fil@@ ed with Ctr@@ l + a , and afterwards , a dialog was asked whether this keyword is supposed to be set . &quot;
this search for changes will take place at every start of the program . it can also be disabled by settings .
&quot; if you have a rule and created and notice that it should be one or its one , you can easily change this with a double @-@ click on the text and in the regular range . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry containing what is sought after in the database . this may be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc . &quot;
( 3 ) : the argument for the Oper@@ ator which is a name or a string that is already set in the database .
you can also specify a Advanced search for all the elements of the database with the following options :
&quot; if you want to group@@ ing options , you just need the cross @-@ box at the end of the rule and then using the button group@@ ing . the options will see as follows : &quot;

this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I found it mainly to &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ed ; s concrete implementation .
the reason why one puts a color @-@ wo@@ und@@ ed workflow is that the colors used by your camera or scanner come an unfor@@ es@@ able devi@@ ation from the actually photograp@@ hed and sc@@ anned colors . with a colored workflow . you can print the colors on your desktop or scanner same and the colors you print or on the web you can print out of your digital dark@@ room .
&quot; if the subject comes to color @-@ administration , then everyone wants to know what buttons , it does not want to provide for the results he wants . unfortunately , yes , that you can informative decisions meet at any point of the photo work@@ flows . additionally , you will find links with deeper information allowing you to obtain the requested results . &quot;
&quot; if your image does not meet every six below criteria , then you will not have to worry about it . &quot;
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum . ( further information can be found below )
your only other images have been sent by e @-@ mail or the web where s@@ R@@ GB of the de @-@ fac@@ to standard .
so if s@@ R@@ GB works so well and life for everybody is so easy to use why should one use another bul@@ b and to make thoughts about colour w@@ ages ?
&quot; a visual example of the limitation of s@@ R@@ GB compared to the colors that we can be seen below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ stle @-@ shaped region , and the colours in s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some larger farms so visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms exc@@ ell@@ ente side and click on info and then on information About R@@ GB Working sp@@ aces .
&quot; must I be said to my monitor , if I decided to work only in s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum ? &quot;
&quot; yes ! if you do not work in s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum , since s@@ R@@ GB it does that your ; on@@ itor on s@@ R@@ GB is running the circle . if you like to work with the s@@ R@@ GB standards , then you have to either use your monitor to the s@@ R@@ GB Standard to use a pass@@ able monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions available , which can improve an image in most cases . use it therefore before you try a further manual processing . &quot;
&quot; the functions norm@@ alis@@ e , identical , automatic ab@@ same and contrast extend from the menu cor@@ ding automatic correc@@ tion automatically attempt to make your colors the best . you will be experim@@ enting with these effects . they will be experim@@ enting with these effects . they will be able to see which at best in your photo . &quot;
&quot; Nor@@ m@@ alis@@ e : this method s@@ ali@@ zes the leu@@ st@@ strength@@ ens on the entire image , so the dark@@ est point is black and the bright@@ est point is as bright as possible without its color sh@@ ady . this function is often a gast@@ ric correc@@ tion for images that are dark or balanced . &quot;
&quot; same : this method j@@ us@@ hed the lumin@@ osity of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ og@@ rams of the intensity of the image , sometimes it makes the same very good results in improving the contra@@ sts of the image , sometimes it also produces a very powerful surgery that either mir@@ acles with a picture or it was destroyed . &quot;
&quot; automatic down@@ stairs : this method max@@ imi@@ zing the color area in the Rot@@ - , green and blue kan@@ al . you are determined the dark and bright border @-@ sounds and j@@ us@@ hed the red , green and blue channels on the entire history range . &quot;
contrast to extend : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ osity of the R@@ GB values of a image by moving the low@@ est range and a new values of all values in between . this is only visible in balanced pictures and can be a good correc@@ tion for bad photos .
the white ch@@ ali@@ ke of &amp; D came ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white @-@ off of a photo .
&quot; the white correc@@ tion is a bit limited because about a Far@@ mer room with 8 @-@ bit per colour , if you can perform too far from the original image . if you are able to perform too far from the original mode , which in the 16 @-@ bit mode can be better off in the 16 @-@ bit mode , so will your possibilities for correc@@ tion better drop . &quot;
this tool is based on a white @-@ comparison table of the copyright of P@@ aw@@ el T. Jo@@ ch@@ ym . you start it via the menu colors white cor@@ ds of the image processing .
&quot; the show@@ case can be adapted in the size . on the left side , both the original picture is adapted as well as the preview of the target . if you want to see the original whit@@ eboard , then it ranges back to the original window . &quot;
the preview of the target group has a red mar@@ ker . the L@@ umin@@ ance of the pixel under this mark@@ er is shown as vertical line in the hist@@ og@@ rams .
&quot; on the right up there is a hist@@ ogram visible , as soon as you change one parameter . this hist@@ og@@ rams is very helpful as you can decide in well illumin@@ ated pictures , most pixels very small layers values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum will be displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on sh@@ adows , satur@@ ation and gam@@ ma . the shadow adjustment allows you to enhance the attend@@ ance of your photos or also di@@ mming . &quot;
&quot; continue using the controls around the above controls , you should use the color temperature Pi@@ p@@ ette . click on this button and afterwards , to use the selected color for the calculation of the color temperature of the white . in this way the temperature and green values are automatically set . &quot;
additionally you can set the white comparison with the list of pre@@ ferences . the following settings are available :
the trans@@ former indi@@ ic@@ ator increases the colors when more than a color @-@ channel of the Pix@@ els .. you will display the combined result of the white @-@ color . this is shown in the preview as the indic@@ ator of indic@@ ator and has no effect on the final picture .
buttons Save as and loading exactly this . every setting of the white comparison you can save you in a text file and later load later .
the button pre@@ ference sets all the filter values back to their standard values and the related neutr@@ als . notice that also neutral settings are a different photo than your original result . if you save this original picture .
&quot; you can set here the key@@ pad pro @-@ bit co@@ ding . 8 @-@ bit co@@ ding is the widely used JPEG @-@ format , 16 @-@ bit co@@ ding is better for high @-@ quality pictures . this co@@ ding is needed even more turn@@ table , account@@ ability and is available for formats to PNG , PN@@ M , TIFF and DNG . &quot;
&quot; this tool opens the same dialogue as the processing of raw materials . it uses the change and assignment of shades . colour ton@@ m@@ apping can be performed by the sub@@ window for the use of shades . a detailed instructions for the use of shades . a detailed instructions for the use of shades . &quot;
&quot; another important tool is available in the menu under colors Ton@@ ing correc@@ tion . this tool provides an integrated way to store several color channels at the same time , so you can always use them for multiple photos . this is helpful when your camera or your scanner always require the same correc@@ tion . in the manual you will find more information . &quot;
correct a powerful way to correct exposure is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find among colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the &amp; D came ; tool Far@@ g@@ ff@@ er will provide you with four color @-@ effects , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a cant@@ on filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing , solar processing , even Sab@@ ati@@ er called , a effect of being produced by a short flash head , and then the development of the image completed , and the colors used by the second lights were inver@@ ted . the result was a part of the image inver@@ ted . this tool was an indi@@ fferent neg@@ atively of the image . this tool was allowed to give you this interesting effect . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controlled the solar system . at about 50 % intensity , the image shows what chem@@ ically is possible . a further increase is generates a neg@@ atives that is so not on phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . &quot;
this is an example of solar control . the original picture is ( 1 ) and which is processed ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
&quot; the Vi@@ vid filter si@@ mu@@ ates the so called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it is different from a satur@@ ation that he has a stronger contradiction , which makes the colors brilliant and smooth . try it simple , he em@@ bell@@ ished many photos . &quot;
&quot; Vel@@ via is the trademark of Fu@@ ji@@ film is produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Velvet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and therefore a reference for his glori@@ ous image structure . Vel@@ via offers a lot of which colors for nat@@ phot@@ ographers . Vel@@ vi@@ as strong which colors are also some phot@@ ographers , especially those who are hardly pleas@@ urable too much . &quot;
the neo @-@ filter simul@@ ates neo @-@ light to the contra@@ sts . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ ding repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ ural . in large images the filter can arrange the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not un@@ common to correct the shades of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors . as soon as you are satisfied with the result you are using the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
&quot; if you make a photo with bad light relationships , you can also get a good choice for brightness / satur@@ ation rather than raise it . all changes you can do in the preview . when you look at the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool gra@@ dation , and the simple lumin@@ ous strength / contrast / Gamma is the tool key correc@@ tion to improve the exposure . even if the dialogue is very complicated to improve the exposure . specifically the three sli@@ ders below the Hist@@ og@@ ram@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph@@ s of the intensity , an hist@@ og@@ rams , the active channel , or the selected area . under the graph@@ s , three sli@@ ders are able to change into the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright areas . &quot;
the easi@@ est way to learn how to move it the controller and to consider how the picture changes .
&quot; on the right side you can see the original and preview of the image . the preview is dynam@@ ically , based on the settings of the image , updated . on the left hand are the following options available . &quot;
sc@@ aling : with this sel@@ ector can be adjusted , whether the hist@@ og@@ rams with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y @-@ axis is shown . for pictures of a dig@@ it color often include the linear histor@@ ogram from a single column . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic classification . &quot;
&quot; three controllers : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the low@@ est for the medium tones , common gam@@ ma@@ values . &quot;
&quot; the three color pin@@ ps can be used in the preview of the original document , in order to make the input values of the shade , medium and bright tones automatically . in addition , there is a button for a full automatic adjustment . &quot;
excep@@ tions : the default values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that may be used for example . comp@@ ressing the output values can be used for example as a background to create something else in the for@@ eg@@ round .
automatically : with this kno@@ b the imaging will automatically set to the intensity of the image .
&quot; save and store : with these buttons , the values can be stored in the fil@@ es@@ ystem and later loaded . it is used to use the Gimp Levels format . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and the three color pip@@ ing , the procedures will use automatically for all the sh@@ adows , means and sun @-@ sounds new j@@ us@@ ement . enable the color pip@@ ette to use the input values of the hist@@ og@@ rams for rot@@ ary , green , blue and the c@@ umin@@ channels . &quot;
the option over @-@ indic@@ ator controlled all the channels in order to display ex@@ bel@@ i@@ fied pixel and you can display the combined result of all channels . this is an indic@@ ator that means you get the effect only in preview and it is not an effect on the final result .
below you can see an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and Alpha channel , as well as the output values are un@@ changed . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the correct picture with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left side the half of the original and the target image display . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated by your settings . on the right , the following options are available : &quot;
Modification Channel : this sel@@ ector allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
&quot; in addition to this box are two icons to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for pictures that have been added with a digital camera , the linear mode creates a wide beams . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode continues . &quot;
&quot; if you like to move e.g. a short break after the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones with dark le@@ ver , and that the corresponding sculp@@ tor will be dar@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original photos is a red mark@@ er . if you want to change this mark@@ ings on the field you want to change , the original line is displayed on the curve . create a point on this line and move it up and down , until the value is left to your taste . &quot;
&quot; save and store : with these buttons , you can do exactly this . each curve you can have created in the fil@@ es@@ ystem and later load . the file format is the Gimp Kur@@ ven@@ format . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use this method and the three color pip@@ ing buttons , automatically create the check@@ points of curve for all channels of sl@@ att@@ ing , central and sun@@ shades . enable the color pip@@ ing you want to use and click the original location to set the check@@ points for the Rot@@ - , Green , Blue and L@@ umin@@ esc@@ curve . &quot;
&quot; the option over @-@ indic@@ ator controlled all the channels in order to view over @-@ over pixel . if in more than one channel over@@ loaded pixel . this is an indic@@ ator , that means you get the effect only in preview and it is not an effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a Black @-@ White photo that was correc@@ ted in the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ can@@ al . shade and sun@@ shades was placed on the cur@@ ves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and that correc@@ ted ( 2 ) .
the channel bl@@ ender of the &amp; D came ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the shades of the photo .
the channel bl@@ ender is another high @-@ developer tool to mix the shades of the pictures . you can edit it from the menu colors Channel Mixer of imaging .
&quot; with the channel sel@@ ector , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first note that you can correct your channels using the relative distribution and r@@ ash . the left section of the window will show you a preview of the window . the original can be viewed as compared to your own rider . &quot;
the preview of the target has a red mar@@ ker . if you want to position this in the picture a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color .
&quot; the controls for the module are right below : controls for red , green and construction it enables you to activate this channels . this is particularly practical if you also enable the appropriate color components . this is particularly convenient if you also enable the appropriate color components . this is particularly convenient if you also enable the appropriate color components . this is particularly convenient if you also use the appropriate color components . this is particularly convenient if you want to reduce the appropriate color components . this is particularly convenient if you want to reduce the appropriate color components . this is particularly convenient if you want to reduce the appropriate color components . try to reduce the screen for black @-@ white conver@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially if you mix mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a color comes to a visible area that comes from the farms that is not in the same place in the shade and whose room pattern in each channel is different to improve your mon@@ och@@ rome conversion and thereby enhance the bull &apos;s first . &quot;
stor@@ ing as and charging buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any bl@@ ender setting can save you for later and then load . the user @-@ channel file is the Gimp channel mi@@ xer format .
the option over @-@ indic@@ ator controlled all the channels in order to display ex@@ bel@@ i@@ fied pixel and you can display the combined result of all channels . this is an indic@@ ator that means you get the effect only in preview and it is not an effect on the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the Blue channel has been re@@ ven@@ ed . the option L@@ umin@@ ance is activated . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the modified image under ( 2 ) .
&quot; black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstract photography . with the development of digital photography . with the development of digital photography . &quot;

green filters : simul@@ ates a black / white fil@@ mb@@ ing with a green lin@@ ing filter . this looks good for portra@@ its in all scene and fits very good at portra@@ its against the sky . so similar to the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
&quot; Oran@@ ge@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white fil@@ mb@@ ing with a orange line filter . this improves landscapes , mari@@ time scenes and air @-@ pictures . so similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Oran@@ ge@@ filter . &quot;
rot@@ ter : simul@@ ates a black / white fill@@ et with a red lin@@ ing filter . this creates dram@@ atic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simul@@ ate lun@@ atic b@@ ent times . therefore similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ filter .
Gel@@ b@@ Filter : simul@@ ates a black / white fil@@ mb@@ ing with a yellow lin@@ ing filter . this is the most natural color correc@@ tion and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) gels filter .
Sep@@ iat@@ on : produces warm bright and medium tones during he adds a bit cold in the sh@@ ores of a print and re@@ development in a Sep@@ iat@@ er . this is typical of the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
&quot; with the &amp; D , tool texture , you can use decorative tex@@ tures on a picture . &quot;
&quot; by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can look like a oil painting on a screen , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlar@@ ged points or like a wall picture on a wall . &quot;
Rel@@ ief : move this parameter to the right increases the r@@ ashes of the depth or tri@@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper texture is applied on the photo below . the original picture is shown ( 1 ) and that changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter Rel@@ ief has been set to 200 .
the &amp; D arrived ; tool frame can add a decorative frame to be added to a picture .
the eye of a beh@@ older has to keep in the limits of a photos is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to create a decorative frame . this is an psych@@ ological bar@@ rier to create a decorative frame . under the picture , the module can be started out of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; type : with this parameter you put the desired frame type for your image . starting the image with a coloured line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce embr@@ aces it with a cute three @-@ dimensional frame , the ideal for a button @-@ dimensional and decorative addition adds a decorative frame with patterns . &quot;
width : returns the width of the frame in percent . the value for width is from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; this is bigger than the original aspect , but the original aspect ratio is greater than the original aspect ratio . this is important for printing of the pictures , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before . &quot;
&quot; with this convenient tool , you can easily insert a form@@ att@@ ed text in an image at any position . this also goes to several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it using your properties like you need . the larger the image , the bigger one has to be set . you can simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ be@@ able background . &quot;
&quot; each setting you have chosen for your text , can be changed by clicking the button &quot; OK . &quot; after the picture is saved once , the text part of the image . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
with the &amp; D arrived ; tool template can be added to a template on an image .
the menu image template can be used in the image processing can be used to templates for over a picture .
&quot; for the Template , there are no restrictions on the size and orientation . you need to add the PNG file format and should be added with maximum comp@@ ression ( 9 ) to add the file size of the drawings . if you just send an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; digi@@ pack ; mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ joined @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
if you use this tool for the first time you need to put your template folder with the button bas@@ est@@ ner in dialog . choose the folder to you the template press . these settings will be measured for the next start .
&quot; after the root , it has been set for templates , the folder structure of the template folder will be reflected . the selection of a folder will be updated automatically . &quot;
under the preview there are three buttons with those you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image .
enlarge The button enlar@@ ged this button . it is cent@@ ered to the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; res@@ cent : this kno@@ ck@@ ed the image . it is cent@@ ered to the position of the mouse . in case you want to apply the template on the whole picture , you need to res@@ i@@ fy the image according to the left mouse button . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move it : use this button to move under the template below . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to use the template on your image . the image will then be automatic on the thumb@@ nails .
&amp; D came ; provides three different tool for a sharp@@ ness at your disposal . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for a sharp@@ ness . it is very fast and simple , but creates especially in dark areas , gran@@ ular pictures . &quot;
&quot; Un@@ sharp@@ ness @-@ Mask works on the contrast of the can@@ ti@@ st for a picture of shar@@ pen@@ ing . actually , it is not a bit more psych@@ ovis@@ u@@ ally . you can use it to be atmosph@@ eric g@@ st and it makes it a really good job . the algorith@@ m was taken from Gimp and it is protected by W@@ inst@@ on Chang . &quot;
&quot; Ref@@ ec@@ ussi@@ ans may be the best of the three , as he really improves the sharp@@ ness . he is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt . &quot;
&quot; photos without focus , as well as most digit@@ alized images need a correc@@ tion of sharp@@ ness . this is that the same phenomenon can be combined with only minimal differences to a colour point . the same phenomenon can also be printed when color points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras can normally be printed as a normal cameras for the private use . &quot;
&quot; in JPEG @-@ Pictures , a camera is often applied in internal sharp@@ ness . pictures in the size format , on the contrary , you must always be shar@@ pen@@ ed during processing . &quot;
&quot; some scanner turn into a sharp@@ ness filter already during the reading of the image . if you de@@ activate this de@@ activate , you get the control of your image . &quot;
in some situations you can receive results by using a photo with the shooting range . this allows you to call it with the menu items .
&quot; but you should not be careful , as the results are not very natural : the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the ed@@ ges , but also strengthening the smo@@ kers . in general , you can find out more information about the menu of reflection . you can find more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharp@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution , the picture is a little soft to paint , is much easier than to shar@@ pen@@ ed it . use the tool for soft@@ ener cor@@ ks and experi@@ ment something with settings . the show@@ case on the right side of the dialogue shows you the effect on your photo . &quot;
the filter bl@@ ur@@ red m@@ ask@@ ing is a very good tool to remove v@@ eil from your photos . a demonstration you can see here .
the original image and the preview help the image to edit . the show@@ case shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and amount . the standard values are common good results and should go first . an increase in radius or the operator will strengthen the effect . if you create the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing m@@ ask . if you create the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing m@@ ask , will create space and get the impression of gr@@ ats near sharp ed@@ ges . &quot;
the radius poses a how many pixels on each side of a edge through the filter are affected . high @-@ resolution images allow greater radi@@ i . you should therefore take pictures at the best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage of the original and the p@@ added image of the original one that is added to the original . thus the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the spon@@ ge is a fr@@ action of the maximum R@@ GB value and the difference . one can thus define a minimal difference thus for a cure of the filter . in this way areas with a soft change between the tones of shar@@ pen@@ ing and therefore fl@@ aw in faces .
&quot; this is an example of the un@@ sharp m@@ ask@@ ing filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image the ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp m@@ ask@@ ing was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a spon@@ ge = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; D came ; tool Ref@@ ec@@ ussi@@ ans ref@@ used a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used by copyright protected filters to Ernst Li@@ ppe .
&quot; this tool tries to get a picture to &amp; quot ; ref@@ oc@@ ussi@@ ans . this is better approach as a few trying to shar@@ pen@@ ing the photo called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tration . it can usually run a technique called FI@@ R Wiener filtration . &quot;
&quot; in practice the circular folding is much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos; sche folding . the Gau@@ ß &apos; sche F@@ altung has a very long tail , which causes the mathemati@@ cal outcome also from the original pixel pixel . the FI@@ R Wiener In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding will depend on most cases even very strongly influenced by the original pixel . it causes un@@ wanted results . &quot;
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . you can set a higher value when your image should look very bl@@ ur@@ red but then in Heiligen@@ stadt .
cor@@ relation : an increase in the cor@@ relation can help reduce the cor@@ relation can be chosen by 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0,99 . a high value for the cor@@ relation reduces the sharp@@ ness effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; smoking filters : an increase in the room filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , the filter can decrease values of 0 @-@ 1 . however , values can be values of 0 @-@ 1 . however , values are higher than 0.1 . however , the image quality is very bad . a usable value is 0@@ .03 . a high value will still be wast@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the pal@@ ate &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter to avoid un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed filter . in most cases , you should not use this value on 0 to avoid angry art@@ e@@ facts , you might also have to increase the cor@@ relation and / oder@@ Ab@@ ate filter . &quot;
&quot; mature size : this value determin@@ es the size of transformation sm@@ at@@ rix . an increase in the mat size can have good results , especially if you choose large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the pal@@ ate &apos;s shot . in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
stor@@ ing as and charging buttons are used exactly for this purpose . anyone any refl@@ ecting parameters have set the you will be saved for later and can then be downloaded .
try all the cutting edge , color and intensity and intensity on the picture before you use the module . &quot;
otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that a lot of operations changes not immediately visible are not immediately visible but later un@@ pleasant art@@ e@@ facts .
&quot; if you want to read and comp@@ ress , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ comp@@ ressed picture . &quot;
&quot; generally , sharp cus@@ ing better results as sharp@@ ness . this could be causing this , the un@@ sharp mas@@ cot is used as a sharp@@ ness . &quot;
theore@@ tically speaking mas@@ cot must always produce arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can always show the effect of the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing . even under optimal conditions it can always show the effect of the FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ ters . convenient is the result of FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ ters . convenient is the result of the FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ ters . the FI@@ R Wiener Filter is often better in the processing of small details .
&quot; below you can view a comparison between the different filters , on a small in@@ foc@@ al picture : &quot;
the original un@@ sharp color@@ image must be correc@@ ted . this picture has been made using a analogue camera . the focus is in@@ sufficient light for the Auto @-@ Focus lens .
&quot; for more information about the methods of shar@@ pen@@ ing correc@@ tion in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address . &quot;
the regul@@ ator gl@@ oss sets the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing of the sub@@ mission of the ab@@ duc@@ ted to create a natural p@@ avi@@ or .
&quot; the Col@@ tin@@ te allows a customized color for the p@@ avi@@ or . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust this here . &quot;
the tool image correc@@ tion is one of the most developed developed tool to do not desired art@@ e@@ facts with un@@ prec@@ ed@@ ented speed .
the in@@ painting algorith@@ m has been developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pre@@ ferences as starter to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the available pre@@ ferences are shown below :
&quot; if you want to use the filter@@ ing settings for you , you can use the rider smo@@ othing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detail @-@ keeping p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to an equivalent smo@@ othing over the picture . w@@ og@@ s bigger value mainly given the homogen@@ eous regions of smooth@@ es and details . &quot;
&quot; notes Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value is equal in all directions , while a value of 1 can have a high value of 1 only in one direction . in JPEG Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te will be given a high value of a high value of a similar patterns . JPEG Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te will be best viewed by 1 . &quot;
&quot; smooth@@ ly &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this puts the maximum smo@@ othing factor above all . then put this value therefore suitable to the degree of space in your image . &quot;
&quot; reg@@ ularity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter is set to greater structures . the higher this value is set , the more is necessary to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos;@@ Tur@@ bul@@ ences effect , it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
repe@@ at@@ ings : returns to how often the algorith@@ m is going through . usually here 1 or 2 .
&quot; angle gradu@@ al da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is small , you should also choose a long term . consider that little corner should be chosen for a long term . you should also choose this value as much as possible and for your needs . &quot;
&quot; integral step @-@ wide &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integ@@ ral step@@ span in pixels . you should avoid the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixels smo@@ othing and never greater than 2 . &quot;
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more of quality that you get through calls this option is only low . he dou@@ bled it but the term . we recommend it to allow him to make it .
buttons Save as and loading exactly this . every setting of image error can correct this in a text file and later re@@ charged .
&quot; error correc@@ tion is compar@@ atively very fast at work . but it can still be very long and a high CPU burden will pull . you can therefore check the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b break@@ down . &quot;
below you can see how to remove pictures with Small Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te . the module is being used on a photo that is applied in Guatemala City with a analogue camera . as you see there is a pec@@ uli@@ ar black lin@@ ing during the journey is caused by ( 1 ) and the correct picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the &amp; D came ; cater@@ pillar is a very powerful tool to reduce cap@@ tion . it uses an copyright algorith@@ m from Peter Heck@@ ert . &quot;
&quot; this tool provides exten@@ sible image filter to remove patches and other art@@ e@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens to remove . it can also be used to remove adhesive , from the camera or mo@@ i@@ re@@ ac@@ ute ; -@@ effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about Sensor@@ rau@@ matic by Dig@@ ital@@ k@@ amer@@ as , so you can read them in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen top shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO Sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ined room that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you will only need the under@@ window details and the sub @-@ window settings may remain with the default settings .
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . great values increase the time that the filters is specified in the radius and the color in it will be filled with that minor errors . &quot;
sharp@@ ness : controlled the shar@@ pen@@ ing level . this value sets the pixel rate to determine the filter . if it is increasing if you need to change the ed@@ ges . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can no longer receive and smo@@ kers or lubric@@ ation occurs again . &quot;
&quot; ed@@ ges : controlled the cant@@ at@@ ability for the shar@@ pen@@ ing . this value improves the frequencies of the filter . if he can appear too strong , if you can do not remove the entire room or pre@@ dat@@ ag@@ les , if you want to remove it on a value near the maximum , if you want to remove a weak room or JPEG @-@ art@@ e@@ fak@@ te want to be losing out without details . &quot;
lumin@@ ance : controlled the lumin@@ ance oler@@ ance of the image . we recommend you either color or intensity to improve an image . these settings do not influence the smo@@ othing process through the details of the details .
color : controls the color @-@ toler@@ anc@@ ance of the image . we recommend you either color or intensity to improve an image . these settings do not influence the smo@@ othing process through the details of the details .
Gamma : controlled the Gam@@ mat@@ oler@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the toler@@ ances of the dark areas , which typically become stronger , but also the base ranges . &quot;
D@@ amping : controls the alignment of the Ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ atur . this value defines how fast the adap@@ tive filter radius on variations of the lumin@@ ance is re@@ acted . if it is too high can be a conspir@@ acy . if he can appear on his minimum , can pre@@ domin@@ ate and Ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter at the ed@@ ges . he can remove pre@@ tips and is the recommended method for it . &quot;
&quot; store under and shop : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters of the pre@@ ference , which you have set , can be saved into the fil@@ es@@ ystem and later loaded . &quot;
this is an example of how pre@@ vent@@ ing your life can change . the original picture is marked with ( 2 ) and that correc@@ ted with ( 2 ) .
&quot; sometimes a picture is too cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution , the picture is a little soft to draw , fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen@@ ed it . use the tool on the right side of the dialog . the show@@ case on the right side of the dialogue shows the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
the &amp; D came ; photo Restaur@@ ation is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo@@ art@@ ef@@ ise .
&quot; this filters to restor@@ es gives you the possibility to remove a lot of un@@ wanted species of art@@ e@@ facts from your pictures . it is very good adapted to Gau@@ ß &quot; &quot; smo@@ othing , comp@@ ression , comp@@ ression , comp@@ ression , comp@@ ression , and receives the content as it also gets the human eye . &quot;
the same algorith@@ m can be used for color@@ - and tex@@ tures . the tex@@ ture is being used with another tool , the error correc@@ tion , carried out by the I@@ MAGE team of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project . &quot;
JPEG Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te reduce : the comp@@ ression of JPEG is not perfect to see in some areas even very far away . as a ver@@ lu@@ te compress@@ ors ; - small standards included in the un@@ comp@@ ressed image . this setting aims to correct these problems .
buttons Save as and loading exactly this . every setting of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and later re@@ charged .
photo @-@ restaur@@ ation is compar@@ atively very fast at work . but it can still be very long and a high CPU burden will pull . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b .
below you can reduce how to reduce a photo with equ@@ ator mig@@ rate .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that with a min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO was able to see . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and that correc@@ ted under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures can be applied to an old color photo that was inv@@ ented with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts and the phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the correct picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the &amp; D came ; tool Hot@@ Friend allows you to remove hot@@ pixel of photos that have been protected using a CCD camera gem , eight . it uses algorith@@ ms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project , protected by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p . &quot;
&quot; bright , tot@@ e or hot pixel are particularly with high quality raw materials photos of a problem as many cameras with JPEG comp@@ ression using a built @-@ in op@@ pression for hot pixel . &quot;
&quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; lumin@@ ous Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; airy Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a picture with a dark picture method . there are currently no manual method to choose the bad pixels . &quot;
Download this file in the wiz@@ ard with the button dark@@ screen . the tool will determine automatic the hot and bright pixel . these are high@@ lighted in the image .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you want to record the dark picture directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixels through CCD Def@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should load the suitable dark picture to correct image . see here that the wiz@@ ard will remember the last sea picture and this automatically loads this automatically into the next session . &quot;
the image and the preview can help you correct the result in the image . the show@@ case displays the output of the filter with the current at@@ titu@@ des . poor pixels are high@@ lighted in all operations .
select an area around the def@@ ective pixels on the Preview and the results of the filter . choose the best filters to cross these pixels . these are the available filters :
&quot; Dur@@ ing : it is determined an average of the neighbor@@ ing pixel . the color will be assigned to all def@@ ective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this will be separately for the horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block to calculate a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of linear cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of linear cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) .
square : this is the default method of default . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less for pixel block will be drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of square cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ish the pixels in the block .
ku@@ cos@@ ah@@ ed@@ ron : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ ku@@ b@@ ische surface ( 2 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of ku@@ b@@ cal cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) which is used to inter@@ pol@@ ish the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
&quot; below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correc@@ tion on a color photo , from a def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure to see . the original picture has been viewed at 300 % enlar@@ ged ( 1 ) and the correct picture is below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; D came , Vig@@ net@@ ost@@ correc@@ tion is a tool to correct the vig@@ or@@ ative , i.e. under@@ scor@@ ed cor@@ ners , of an image . &quot;
&quot; far for@@ ge objective , in particular the middle and large photo format , can often illumin@@ ated the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ ady ) them reduce the cor@@ ners and gra@@ ves of the image by achieving the light of the sensor . &quot;
&quot; but it also has dis@@ advantages . many Center filters require a factor 1,5 or 2 at the aper@@ ture filter , which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand . Weit@@ ls objective should also use with Center @-@ filters , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise un@@ shar@@ pest effects by movement arise . &quot;
&quot; with the large exposure of today &apos;s fil@@ men@@ and the color or gray @-@ stage machine , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a Cent@@ er@@ filter by digital transformation , which is done without the effect of a Cent@@ er@@ filter , which is done without this filter . the algorith@@ m is protected by the algorith@@ m . the algorith@@ m is protected by John Walker . &quot;
with three controllers you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ost@@ correc@@ tion filters and with three further the exposure of the target image .
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light absor@@ ption on the point of the greatest density of the filter . the standard density is 2,0 , resulting in an op@@ tical filters with a aper@@ ture of 2 , sp@@ sp@@ ace@@ .@@ In@@ cre@@ ase the density to compens@@ ate a greater degree of vig@@ or@@ ative , reduce it to compens@@ ate a small degree . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ ous , contrast and Gamma settings : the edit of an image with the vig@@ or@@ isation correc@@ tion reduces the lumin@@ osity of the pixel . you need to re@@ use the exposure of the target with these options . the regul@@ ator will provide you only positive values since you only have to increase the settings . &quot;
if you want to use a fin@@ er re@@ vocation of exposure to exposure to zero and use the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / Gamma for zero and use the gra@@ dation of the &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation ; image processing from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ost@@ ing correc@@ tion on an image . the original picture ( 1 ) displays the vig@@ or in the cor@@ ners and ( 2 ) this is correct . a lumin@@ ous correc@@ tion and contra@@ st@@ correc@@ tion was also carried out with this tool .
the &amp; D came ; Lin@@ sen@@ ret@@ acy is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses an copyright algorith@@ m by David Hod@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric di@@ stor@@ tions . colorful di@@ stor@@ tions can not be correc@@ ted with this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second degree covers the general geomet@@ rical di@@ stor@@ tion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or conv@@ ex form of the image .
&quot; the co@@ efficient of the third gra@@ b has a similar round effect , but fl@@ aw at the ed@@ ges . this correc@@ tion is not applied in the tool . &quot;
the co@@ efficient fourth gra@@ des correc@@ ted the distant lands set to that of the second gra@@ dient . if you combine these two can be elimin@@ ated any geomet@@ rical di@@ stor@@ tion .
general : this value controls the strength of the di@@ stor@@ tion second degrees . with negative values can be correc@@ ted ton@@ gues or positive values .
corner : this value controls the strength of the di@@ stor@@ tion fourth degree . this value has become stronger than in the middle of the image . for most l@@ enti@@ ls the &apos; Cor@@ ners parameters has the &apos; corner parameter to be the mark of the parameter .
Zoom : this value sc@@ ali@@ zes the God@@ dess and therefore results a correc@@ tion first degrees by . negative values increase while positive image .
&quot; bright , the brightness in the cor@@ ners of the image . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the cor@@ ners , while positive values they increase . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filter@@ ing settings , illustr@@ ated the dialogue with a preview the di@@ stor@@ tion correc@@ tion . the values you use for your image will be saved and used in the next start as standard values . &quot;
the ton@@ n@@ - or kis@@ sing correc@@ tion should be carried out in front of all suppliers or sizes . in case you can do this correc@@ tion as all first by . in case you are able to do a picture and then carry out a tone to correc@@ tion , the effect would be appar@@ ent of the fal@@ sche . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best correc@@ tion to you , this tool will display a vertical and horizontal spread lines . move the mouse button to fix the mouse button in your image and press the left mouse button to correct the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the ton@@ n@@ - / kis@@ sing @-@ shaped intake with the help of the lines . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a kis@@ sing di@@ stor@@ tion , the resulting image of black cor@@ ners . you can trans@@ forming this with the agg@@ reg@@ ate tool in the menu trans@@ forming suppliers from the image processing or on the Zoom regul@@ ator of this dialogue . &quot;
&quot; for most of the pictures highlights the ton@@ stone &apos;s correc@@ tion . the next logical step for some moti@@ fs like photos from the front , frame and paintings , it is the perspective to correct the all angles in the image 90 degrees . note that when you keep the camera with your hand you will always have a s@@ light di@@ stor@@ tion of perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the ton@@ s. correc@@ tion applied to a church in Norway . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the correct picture below ( 2 ) .
the algorith@@ m is based on a method for simul@@ ate in@@ frar@@ ed from the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u@@ .org website that can be reached under this URL . the filter re@@ produced the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ in@@ och@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this movie has a sensi@@ tiv@@ ating range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
in the left side of the window you can select the area for the preview . if you look at the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can look at the effect on different parts of the picture .
bene@@ ath the preview you can adjust two parameters to set el@@ ong@@ ation and film@@ Sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the option to simul@@ ate an extremely sensitive movie . the ISO controller changes the amount of film@@ grain and domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in the conversion . green meadows are white as snow !
&quot; since the filter colour channels to re@@ produce in@@ frar@@ ed film , especially the green @-@ can@@ al does not make sense the effect on black / white photos , since the color information are missing . &quot;
this is an example of in@@ frar@@ ed fil@@ ming is applied to a Land@@ schafts@@ photo of New Zealand . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the modified image under ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the movie has been set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of aur@@ a in the hands .
&quot; the &amp; D came ; filter film@@ gr@@ itt is an easy to use tool to re@@ produce film@@ grain , such as the B / W Kodak Tr@@ i @-@ X known . to increase the sensitivity of films the manufacturer big silver @-@ gra@@ ined of the photo . &quot;
&quot; the movie theater gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move into the past . the treated picture gets a tim@@ eless atmosphere get rid of daily life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , o@@ bey phot@@ ographic , gra@@ ined view especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ men photos , so you need to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the regul@@ ator can be the ISO @-@ sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ularity of the bas@@ k@@ ets . the standard value is , although often higher values need to be used on ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need even more gra@@ ins , so you can use the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film @-@ circle @-@ based on a black / white image . the original image is ( 1 ) and that worked ( 2 ) . the user @-@ rated film@@ sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; D came ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorith@@ m by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ed ; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice appearance like an oil painting . natural pictures and down@@ time are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two regul@@ ator to influence this effect . the key will choose the brush @-@ size between one and five out . thick@@ er brushes are better suited for large pictures . smooth@@ es controls the smo@@ othing or , from the other side looks , the sni@@ ff@@ ness . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting . the original picture is marked with the ( 2 ) and the mach@@ ining is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixels large image is 1 and smo@@ othing 17 .
&quot; the &amp; D came , filter coal drawing , and Int@@ ensity Array , to create a co@@ les@@ k@@ iz@@ ze . the lines that are slowly change in the drawing . it is helpful when you want to imagine which scene you have chosen for you to sk@@ ate yourself . this would be good pictures to start with them . &quot;
&quot; there are two controllers with a valu@@ ed range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper controller choos@@ es the foundations size and the lower the contrast ( smo@@ othing ) . &quot;
this is an example of char@@ coal filter . the original picture ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be improved by adjustment of the intensity .
&quot; the &amp; D came ; filter engraving character@@ iz@@ es your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was painted in wax . it uses an copyright algorith@@ m by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; D came ; filter engraving is a quick tool to give your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure , where color is not the most important in the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity , in order to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ ish landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows the contrast of the filter@@ ing . a value of 30 , equivalent to 10 % , is the default . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
&quot; with this filter@@ ing group , you can transform a normal photo into a artwork by di@@ stor@@ tion @-@ effects . it uses protected algorith@@ ms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
wave @-@ blocks 1 : shares the image into cells and can look like it is considered by glass blocks .
wave @-@ blocks 2 : analog to the wav@@ en@@ isk 1 will di@@ pped the image here with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can cancel this effects at any time with the kno@@ b .
&quot; with this filter@@ ing group , you can transform a normal photo into a artwork by un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing effects . it uses protected algorith@@ ms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
Zoom un@@ sharp@@ ness : res@@ ist the image along stern@@ tu@@ b@@ ular lines which go from a central point . this simul@@ ates an zo@@ om@@ ating camera and thus generates a dynamic expression of often in the sport photograp@@ h .
radi@@ al Un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing : temp@@ ting the image by rotation of pixels around a central point . this simul@@ ates the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing of a rot@@ ating camera .
un@@ dist@@ ressing the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused Camer@@ al@@ ysis . the object seems to be back in the background .
&quot; moving the image through horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the un@@ sharp@@ ness of a linear movements , z : B : from a car or train photograp@@ h , camera . &quot;
&quot; soft@@ ener Un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing , the picture is soft in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this is ideal for creating romantic portra@@ its , glam@@ our photos , or to adding a warm and subtle bul@@ b . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : p@@ all@@ ing the image by random shift of the pixel and simul@@ ates the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing of a temp@@ oral camera . &quot;
intelligent un@@ sharp@@ ness : finds the bul@@ bas@@ ins in the picture and get these without the rest .
mos@@ a@@ ic : shares the photo into rectangular cells and then created it by the col@@ t with an average pixel .
some effects require long time to calculate and cause high CPU load . you can therefore break this calculation at any time with the kno@@ b .
the shelves are a nice little tool to make reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ s on your image . thus it gives natural your pictures a n@@ asses appearance . it uses one by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n by protected algorith@@ m .
dri@@ pping size allows the size of the drops to change . as the trop@@ hy size is not automatically to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish changes the op@@ tical effect of the drops in the picture .
&quot; you can hold an area free of rain @-@ rop@@ s ; image processing can hold a range of rain @-@ rop@@ s . use the selection tool for example , for example a face that should stay free to stay . if you then start the filter ra@@ ind@@ rop@@ s , the area will remain free of reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ s . &quot;
this is an example of the reg@@ ularity . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset over a storm . the standard values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , so you can bring it through mirr@@ ors or turning into the right orientation . the tools can be found in the menu trans@@ former rot@@ ating or trans@@ former mirr@@ ors . &quot;
photo blow@@ n is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
&quot; a picture to swe@@ ep is simple . the big question is , how can you find an image sur@@ f and the details sharp@@ ly hold ? how can you find the missing information again or gu@@ ess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorith@@ m is used here , makes it a good work . try it and you will see it . &quot;
if a photo you can change the wrong size you can change it on the desired size with the tool size . choose the size of change in the menu and enter the values . the dialog is below to see .
&quot; the tool used to change the size is a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to increase the pixel . if you want to enlarge a little picture with better quality , then try the tool for bu@@ b@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; many educational programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; D came ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorith@@ m of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project . &quot;
you must tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New size and are shown below :
aspect ratio : when this setting is activated is re@@ tained in the entry of the new size the aspect ratio of the original image .
&quot; reg@@ ularity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter is set to greater structures . the higher this value is set , the more is necessary to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos;@@ Tur@@ bul@@ ging effect , it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
buttons saving as and store will be used exactly . every single @-@ solution for photo can be saved as text file and later be loaded back .
&quot; photo blow@@ ing is very fast with what it makes , but it can still be very long and a high CPU burden will pull . you can break the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b . &quot;
you can see below an example of photo shows that the double color picture has been enlar@@ ged . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlar@@ ged picture ( 3 ) is the result of linear standard enlargement to compare .
&quot; cut a photos is not only a common operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . the image processing allows you to create a picture with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and draw up the rect@@ angle , then you &apos;ll see this rect@@ angle then you &apos;ll see the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you let the mouse drop down again , the area of photos will be cut away . this allows you to change the size of the right to cut the area by clicking on the cor@@ ners of the rect@@ angle . a new rect@@ angle create by clicking it with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cutting , use the button of the cutting button of the image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo will be cut ( Ctr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries File Save or File Save File to save the newly added photo . &quot;
&quot; in the thumb@@ nail , you can change the size of the right hand by move the cor@@ ners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you will have defined in the dialog box . &quot;
&quot; in the tool To pro@@ portions , you can specify the orientation as a high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high format , the larger value of height and in the width of width is assigned . &quot;
&quot; the tool after aspect ratio , use a relative aspect ratio . that means it is always the same , regardless of whether you are inches , Inch or any other physical size . you can see for example below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio . &quot;
at the right end of the dialogue there exist two buttons to cent@@ ering the selection automatically horizontal or vertical .
&quot; at the bottom of the dialog you can set up with the Max . ratio of the area for tri@@ pping to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool after aspect ratio , stores its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horiz@@ ont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . if you are displayed as default values depending on orientation purposes . the modified image dimensions are reflected in the EX@@ IF data , so that the EX@@ IF data will be reflected in the EX@@ IF data . &quot;
the settings of the mer@@ ger help allow yourself to create your pictures better . these help are :
&quot; harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic particles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . as the third @-@ rule , harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are a possibility to share a rect@@ angle in similarly harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles at the di@@ agon@@ als . &quot;
&quot; Golden Center : the golden middle is a division that is based on various natural growth patterns , such as the spir@@ al of a Nau@@ til@@ us Mu@@ zy or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we consider as beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden number is the ir@@ rational number 1,6@@ 18@@ 03@@ 39@@ 88 ... and you have been used for the ancient Egypt and Gre@@ eks , who built up your temple and pyram@@ ids . artists and architects have made your pictures , buildings and even photos together to give your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ ac@@ ci sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; starting , where each number is followed by equal numbers 1 : 1.6@@ 18 the golden mid . a composition that is generally follows as vis@@ ually harmon@@ i@@ ous . &quot;
the golden middle puts high @-@ sig@@ hs available if you are shown an image . these help are shown below :
&quot; the Gol@@ den@@ e spir@@ al will give you a good results for your photos . compared to the third @-@ reg@@ el , the golden spir@@ al creates a smooth line of the eye can follow the view of the beh@@ older along the line of spir@@ al and creates a balanced visual river . &quot;
&quot; a further rule is the rect@@ angles of the golden spir@@ al , even golden justi@@ fication is called to create the golden spir@@ al . it should be a line or different objects . this something can just be there without the eye ; it will fulfil its mission . &quot;
&quot; the Golden tri@@ angles also lead itself from the up@@ loaded golden spir@@ al . their ver@@ tices are the middle points of the golden tri@@ angles , Golden tri@@ angles , is not in contrast to harmon@@ i@@ ous tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles can be found in contrast to harmon@@ i@@ ous tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles can be a static object of dynam@@ ically . &quot;
&quot; if you are using the tri@@ angles for your frame , you create a effect of professional phot@@ ographic dynamic symmet@@ ry . try your image focus on one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve differently . &quot;
the options Horiz@@ ont@@ al mirror and Ver@@ tical mirror can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic particles .
with the kno@@ b color you can set the color of the au@@ xili@@ ary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines of your current picture .
the Free rotation is a tool to turn a picture to turn any angle .
&quot; if you do a photo then it happens easy to fix the camera does not exactly ver@@ tically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture where the things to fix a brack@@ et . you can transform this with the &amp; digi@@ tization ; image processing and the tool free rotation . &quot;
turn your image with the slider angle . the values on this sli@@ ders are specified in degrees . with the button pre@@ ferences you can set the slider to 0 degree . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the right .
&quot; for your help , the module free rotation produced a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse @-@ line in the image display around the two lines , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now , you can fix the angle as described in the previous section . &quot;
after you have a picture shot you will find un@@ wanted tri@@ angular holes in the cor@@ ners . a way to fix it is the function trans@@ forming cut out of the image processing .
&quot; an elegant way to cut the image is the function automatic , select one of the following options : &quot;
the option Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing smooth@@ es the image a bit after the rotation . please note the above warning .
all per@@ spek@@ tiv@@ ical transform@@ ations are carried out by a fix@@ point of the so called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares on the cor@@ ners of your image . the preview is then automatically re@@ used . on the right side of the dialogue you will find some information which help you to change the perspective :
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation into pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation into pixels . &quot;
angle left above : displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle right above : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; according to the adaptation of the perspective , the picture becomes a bit per@@ mi@@ zed . for individual adjustment is this effect small , but two adjust@@ ments create a double as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
after you have adapted the perspective you will get imm@@ ac@@ onal tri@@ angular holes on the cor@@ ners . a way to ber@@ some it is the image with trans@@ forming suppliers from the image processing .
&quot; the tool tool is used to move a part of the image into a direction and move the other part into the opposite . a horizontal sh@@ ear for example will move the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part of the picture . this is not a rect@@ angle . you can start this module above transformers . &quot;
step your image by using the Horiz@@ ont@@ al angle and vertical angle . you can click horizontal and ver@@ tically at the same time . you can display horizontal and ver@@ tically at the same time . a preview of the effect will display you and the new dimensions of the target will be shown on the right of the thumb@@ nail .
&quot; at your help you will use a vertical and horizontal line . move the mouse to fix a key point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines now to make your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have carried out the painting , the image will be a bit temp@@ ting . for a single sc@@ ulpt@@ ing , this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gi@@ ble than twice as much as regards , and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
after sh@@ ear the image has un@@ nice tri@@ angular holes in the cor@@ ners . one way to eliminate these is the image with trans@@ forming suppliers from the image processing .
&amp; D came ; needs a number of libraries and other packages to read and write . the available formats are therefore comp@@ ressed from your system and in some cases , by the way these libraries have comp@@ ili@@ es . in most distri@@ butions you can edit a large number of image formats with &amp; D . &quot;
due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to specify a list of all available file formats ; but you will always find JPEG and TIFF below .
&amp; D came ; showing only files in formats to which is familiar with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list . you can change the file in the image processing . you can change this list of fil@@ ements ; accepts this list . in the section configuration you will find more information about this .
nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allows you to select even the format you can use in Wikipedia . &amp; D came ; supports both formats .
&quot; image comp@@ ression is the application of data comp@@ ression drive on digital images . thereby , red@@ und@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data to an efficient way . &quot;
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally there are better , smooth results than JPEG in the same comp@@ ression . the 2000@@ s version can also be stored even if this is stated in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the raw format , so you can read more about Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can find similar format images in JPEG or TIFF using the raw converter from &amp; D . in the section configuration you will find further information on the use of modules with &amp; D . &quot;
&amp; D came ; supports the charging of raw materials only with the program d@@ cra@@ w which came into &amp; D ; all supports cameras you can see below on the web page by Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a brief list of raw materials that came from &amp; digi@@ came ;
many digital cameras support the recording short films . these clips are often saved in avi@@ or or MPEG format . if you want to display these formats and is therefore having no built @-@ in possibilities for movies .
go forward to the previously visited album in the Chronic@@ le . you can only go forward if you go back before .

&quot; graph@@ s ; includes a KDE program for viewing by &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graph@@ s are free layout programs . graph@@ s are used in science , especially in computer science . so far , there was no modern and GUI . program to visu@@ alize graph@@ s &amp; X11 : - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; program with just a few functions . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; Project has set itself the goal to replace these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; KDE program .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a KDE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; dot programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; shows graph@@ s with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; KDE ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI . it has the following functions :
integration into &amp; k@@ ate ; and &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of graph@@ s in &amp; k@@ ate ; represents the graph@@ s and in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ;
menu to open the graph@@ s in &amp; k@@ ate ; open or graph@@ s in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; in a &amp; k@@ ate ; component to open
loading of large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems from about 1000 kn@@ ots and a h@@ ack to add more than these kn@@ ots )
further required software : &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a &amp; KDE ; -@@ program that pres@@ ses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for the display of graph@@ s . required in detail :
&quot; the main window shows the open graphics , each in its own window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; in this case the main window will open the icon file and the ( empty ) list can open the icon file . click on the first icon to open the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after you have chosen one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like in the lower screen photo : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is bigger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this summary or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; the mouse wheel use ( high and r@@ under without special keys , left and right at th@@ rot@@ ter &amp; Alt ; -@@ key ) ; &quot;
the zo@@ om@@ es is restricted in both directions by the factor 10 . below you will see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; if the straight into &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; the file has been changed by another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph should be re@@ charged or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; may make your decision later , you can use your decision later , you can use the menu item settings . &quot;
&quot; if you open a graphite on a running &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; instance open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; instance you want to display a new &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; instance you want to display a new image of the current instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option you can save your choice permanently , but these can also change with the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; when schedule , you can open all graph@@ s of your last session again . again , you can save your choice as well as later . &quot;
they can also specify how the Grap@@ h is to be divided into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be chosen freely .
&quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph@@ s will be sure to be put on this page , the pages may not be filled on this page , the pages may not be filled out of the respective parts of the graphics . &quot;
aspect @-@ show with one on several pages shared graph@@ s without head@@ line and with another font
&quot; the Renew@@ able shop gives the opportunity to set the behavior if a file has changed on the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can specify a default ( automatically re@@ charge or the changes will ignore ) or the program every time . &quot;
the site opening is the possibility to open the behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ ers ; you can set a standard compared to this case ( the graph@@ s open in a new window or in a sub@@ window of already current session ) or determine that every time is asked .
the page session @-@ administration gives the possibility to set the start @-@ behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; you can set a default ( the files of the last session or not ) or determine every start of it .
&quot; the context menu , usually by clicking on the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; &quot;
&quot; here you can choose among different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ lay@@ out@@ algorith@@ ms . the entries are described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z , are : &quot;
&amp; dot ; -@@ algorith@@ m the default for gr@@ ated graph@@ s . he produces hier@@ arch@@ ical or lay@@ ered lay@@ ered graph@@ s . the algorith@@ m lays the can@@ did in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short ed@@ ges and as a few cant@@ een cuts .
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorith@@ m is the default for ung@@ eri@@ fied graph@@ s . he produced portra@@ y@@ als according to the spring@@ spring model . this is the c@@ ada @-@ K@@ aw@@ ai algorith@@ m , which is equal to statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot;

&quot; if a note is published that Ko@@ di@@ zer or tools are missing , so you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ jp@@ eg@@ tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages using the button settings on the right below . &quot;
the pressure @-@ assi@@ stent allows you to print multiple images on a sheet paper together in standard phot@@ ogallery . this combined pictures can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gimp . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve or print directly with the Gimp module .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import your in RAW format stored in one of three formats in JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM . &quot;
the conversion is based on the command line d@@ cra@@ w of Dave Coff@@ in . a original location of Him is : exp@@ ecting the same results as the software from your camera . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ b better results ! .
&quot; first , choose the RAW file to be converted and launch the module . the Ra@@ w @-@ converted window appears in mode for a single picture . with the button preview you can look at the effect of your current settings on the picture . &quot;
&quot; now you can now use the values again to optimize the conver@@ gence process . the essential parameters such as Gamma , Bright@@ ness and red / Blue amplifier can be de@@ ed . if the result is not optim@@ ally able to edit the image later . &quot;
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected to enable you to use the contra@@ indications . if your camera in R@@ GB mode has no effect on the R@@ GB@@ G switch .
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats , and only the conversion result is adjusted accordingly and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a ver@@ lu@@ te algorith@@ m and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; tagged Image Format , TIFF , re@@ tains all the information of your image and uses the encryp@@ ted free L@@ Z@@ W comp@@ ression . &quot;
&quot; if you present your pictures frequently to edit or you later you can not use the JPEG format , since there is only a limited number of operations before the image quality det@@ eri@@ or@@ ated . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
in case you choose JPEG as storage format the met@@ ad@@ ata file included in the RAW file are stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information .
&quot; if you have adapted your settings with the exec@@ ute button you can start the conversion . in case you want to break this process again , so you can use this process . &quot;
&quot; st@@ acking mode allows you to convert different pictures at once . use this mode , therefore if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
the available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images . you have here however the possibility to over@@ write this file . this is helpful when this in an earlier attempt was created . a preview is not available as far the conversion rate is advanced .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album comp@@ ress . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used for ren@@ aming all images of a album . you can use the prefix and the tim@@ est@@ amp ;
&quot; this module can be used to change the size of several images of a image collection , it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can det@@ ect the image or enlarge . &quot;
propor@@ tional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal sizes in a dimension . the width or height of the image will automatically change depending on the image orientation , selected . the aspect ratio remains un@@ changed . &quot;
propor@@ tional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : res@@ ize in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains un@@ changed . you can use this option for example to adapt your image to the screen format .
un@@ propor@@ tional : no propor@@ tional size in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
&quot; printing preparation : prepar@@ es the image for a phot@@ ographic printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the phot@@ op@@ api@@ ers . the target image , including background size , bound@@ ary size and rear color , is accordingly adapted . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your favorite e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to modify the size of the high@@ lighted pictures before . more pictures can be drag and there .
&quot; after which you started the module , the images will be displayed with the images displayed by you . over the button images you can add pictures with a file look dialog . for the last displayed picture the preview is displayed on the right side . &quot;
you can also drag pictures on the Picture List and add it to the list of pictures .
using the button pictures you will remove the selected images from the list of images .
&quot; after you have selected all images , you can open the new message window to your email clients . you need to add the addresses and the subject . you will have to be added here as an attachment . &quot;
do not pay attention to many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have restrictions to the size of the em@@ ails e @-@ mails . it might be a good idea for multiple mails when you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the pictures . your configuration is saved and every@@ time until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you choose Thunder@@ bird so you have to specify the correct path for your installation in the input field .
&quot; if you use the Google Mail Service , you have to install before the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
after the election of comments to a raised file the comments will be added to the images in a text file and the mail .
&quot; the PNG format under the menu image file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of phot@@ od@@ at@@ eries , but it is best adapted among the sealing free format such as TIFF . you should therefore use getting a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you choose to select JPEG under images file format and the original files in the JPEG format , then the original Ex@@ if@@ data are added to the images . &quot;
&quot; if the process is ready , the window will not automatically shut down the status , in search of mistakes . however , your e @-@ mail program will automatically be started at the end . with the button Cl@@ ose you can shut down this window ? &quot;
&quot; after the starting point of the module , Di@@ asch@@ au appears a window with questions like you have shown your slideshow . you can select here between the selected and all images of the album . &quot;
the option OpenGL transi@@ tions in the presentation are using very elegant images using OpenGL . you need to have a corresponding graphics card because otherwise the slideshow is very slow .
the option fil@@ en@@ ames display that the filename is shown in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the option ri@@ bbon ensures that the presentation will be shown in a final loop . you can then manually transfer them manually with Es@@ c ; switch .
the option pictures by chance can choose that the images are displayed in a random order . it is therefore not the order of pictures in the album .
&quot; under delay between the pictures , the temp@@ oral distance between the individual images can be set between the individual images . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard . the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect . you should be inter@@ rup@@ ed before you show the presentation of your friends ! &quot;
there are more than a do@@ zen transi@@ tions between which you can choose . random@@ ly will select a different effect on each transition between the pictures .
&quot; during the slideshow , you can access a tool@@ bar on the upper left screen . move the mouse in this corner to turn you . &quot;
&quot; with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , go to the previous and next picture and stop the slideshow . &quot;
&quot; at the left bottom of the screen , you can see the current filename , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Time &amp; Date does not currently have documentation . if you are interested in writing them , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under KDE @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ org@@ . Attention : the participants from this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module wallpaper is a tool to set a picture as the background image for the work@@ space .
&quot; this module requires the currently selected picture , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menus , as the background for your KDE work@@ space . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided your images and videos with comments , you can see with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; through these brow@@ sing , see picture . as you can see by a comparison with the picture , are now available in each group , so in persons , places and in the group sample items . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window you will see the categories you have entered the categories as you have information and videos with comments . in addition , there are entries to look at EX@@ IF @-@ based information to view the order structure on your hard disk and of course the current thumb@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; if you press the mouse over the entry , the view of the browser . see picture . &quot;
if you select a further person only the pictures are shown on which both individuals can be seen . through this sel@@ ective method you can limit the number of displayed pictures of a few thousand pictures on a few single pictures .
&quot; if you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can view images with thumb@@ nails to look at the pictures of your efficiency . &quot;
&quot; in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of their name . you can store with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person is a own preview , which is of course also for places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself . see the picture . &quot;
&quot; to view images next to the names , select the button that you want to use the right outside on the tool@@ bar . please note that you can choose the view for each category separately . this has the advantage that you can display e.g. symbols with pictures of individuals and at the same time a list of keywords words ( if you have no proper pictures ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you have to specify the image for every single person . now to view this , you will need to select the image Editor , as shown in the picture . now you can custom@@ ize the image for the appropriate person . in this window you can adjust the image factor according to your wishes and thereby selecting the picture to be displayed in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you search the entry window , you will see a dialog that is very similar to the dialog for the establishment of the image features very similar . this dialogue can be seen on the picture even once . &quot;
&quot; if you enter a string in the field of cap@@ tion or description , the cap@@ tions and descriptions of the images will be sent after that text ; the date can either be part of the overall date , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a section of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all pictures according to certain names . here you can see pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you do not like to read the manuals but prefer the functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and check out the quick access to the screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos .
&quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and choose in the first dialog box , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or choose the menu help the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ Demo . then you can download the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a linked HTML document to download . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you see the timeline . a picture of this page you see here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you with data statistics about the pictures in your database . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ bar can show you multiple different units . each body will show you a different unit . you can switch between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by running the body only 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot;
the timeline you can use on the following ways : you can edit the displayed items image view from the database ( if you displayed a date in the preview picture ) and also displays the timeline always displayed the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navig@@ ate in the Preview View .
&quot; you can also select a range of timeline , drag the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ru@@ ler of the timeline , so you can select a range , you will be displayed in the thumb@@ nails only pictures of this period . you can click the selection , by clicking on a beams of the timeline . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you two options available to create HTML websites with your images . the one is included in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version which you can create via the File HTML file ...
&quot; before HTML pages you will need to take some settings . these are described in the three areas of content , layout and finish . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of the indic@@ ator and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album , HTML @-@ example side you can see an example of these settings . &quot;
next you choose whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ Ex@@ port@@ file will be created on the super@@ visory site is to be seen on the super@@ visory page . essential information about the export files can be found in .
&quot; finally , you can select which information can be displayed on the HTML pages , so you can avoid that information can be displayed on the HTML pages , for example that all pictures of a party are obvious . for example , you can not use the viewer , for example , you can not use this attitude to hide certain images before certain view@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; in this section you can specify how the HTML pages are supposed to look like the HTML pages are clearly , which is why not specifically entered . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can set different resol@@ utions for the pictures . this , those who need to look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x@@ 600 , no pictures will download a resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
the view@@ ers of your site can change the resolution at any time . it can therefore set your pictures with low resolution which leads to a lower over time . if he wants to get an image larger than he wants to get a higher resolution .
in this Settings area you specify the different folder and the URL where your website is stored .
the best choice for all your HTML files to one basic folder and for each subsequent set a new sub@@ folder .
&quot; first , you must select the main folder in which all your images will be saved . this folder will be stored and automatically updated for all future images of the storage place . here you can either select a folder or one of KDE suppor@@ tive protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; once you have created your pictures , you can check whether these really are visible for viewing a URL . the URL that you have created here , this folder should be shown . otherwise , this folder will be the wrong folder in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files created by you , you have not yet to copy them into the final target group , you need to manually copy it to it . so that the import function , see , correctly you need to specify the final goal of the files but the bas@@ ec@@ ard in which are all sub@@ folder in which are all sub@@ folder . &quot;
the settings described above all three on bas@@ ec@@ amp or UR@@ Ls in these will be a sub@@ folder to set whose name you set in resol@@ ute .
&quot; if you are looking at a family holiday , a meeting in the company , a conference or anywhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; together , you may want to create a HTML page for viewing the images , recording location , etc . you have to go with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work is not even better . &quot;
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .k@@ im file . you can import and import@@ ed others into your database .
&quot; there are two different types of .k@@ im files , internal and external . you differ in it if the pictures are stored even in the file , that you can have all images in the file that you can have all images in the file . the obvious dis@@ advantage is however the fil@@ esi@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; you can create a .k@@ in file either directly from the menu File export ... or together with HTML pages , see , create a .k@@ in file together with a HTML file , this will create an external .k@@ in file . &quot;
&quot; an external .k@@ in file search the pictures in two ways . first , the images are not found in the folder of the .k@@ im file . this is of course only possible if you have created your .k@@ in file using the HTML export file . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for the export of pictures described you can take over the menu File export ... &quot;
the most important option of this dialogue is whether you should deal with internal or external .k@@ in files . there are the following three choices available :
in the option manufac@@ tur near the .k@@ im file you have to copy the pictures in the same folder as the .k@@ im file .
with the option Automatic in the vicinity of the .k@@ im file copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the pictures are automatically copied for you .
.k@@ in files are normal Zip files . since most pictures were already comp@@ ressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is really worth the files to comp@@ ress . if you still want to comp@@ ress this as you simply select the option Ex@@ port@@ file comp@@ ress .
&quot; the last option of this site is Maximum winter limit . if you want to send your friends images , as the .k@@ im file would be otherwise very big . here you can limit the size by saying that each picture is about 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
if you select a file with the extension .k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu File to select ... will import &amp; photo@@ album ; the export@@ ed database as described in .
&quot; the wiz@@ ard to import it consists of four steps . first , you need to select which pictures you want to import , then in which folder the import can be copied . &quot;
&quot; it can be that you are the category persons of the import@@ ed file person@@ er ( if you are a Danish file ) , while this category will be import@@ ed in the third dialog box , which are to import@@ ed in the third dialog box , which categories of the file are import@@ ed to import@@ ed file and which categories this in your database are to be import@@ ed . &quot;
in the fourth step you can modify the categories of the file to import@@ ed file with the categories of your current database . an example of this you can see on the picture .
&quot; it has to be easy to search and look at pictures : when you look at pictures , you would often be able to see pictures of your Italy holiday and want to discover a picture with your friend you want to look at the example pictures of your Italy holiday , you may want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual you will set the information about your pictures , via ( 2 ) providing information about your pictures , above ( 2 ) to go through to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adap@@ t@@ ability to go through to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adap@@ t@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album has started as a program to the managing your pictures , but it has been extended and today it takes care of your videos . in many places this manual is spoken about pictures , but frequently asked this also videos with one . &quot;
&quot; stores all his information in the file index@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of their images . these are a simple XML file , which you can copy using a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , cop@@ ying on a disk or re@@ visions at the CV@@ S . &quot;
&quot; if you want to read the folder in which your images are automatically saved . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can start a different folder with pictures , you can start with the option -@@ c . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / index@@ .x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; in the following section of the user area , you can get into a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user interface , you will be explained in the following section of the user interface . &quot;
&quot; to the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can call settings for viewing the preview and the options for viewing the viewer . for each setting is available for a button to enter the F1 @-@ button and a click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; described in it , as you can set up for any image different characteristics , for example persons , places and tags . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; see the dialog , which is used to edit already existing groups . for each existing group you can select a cap@@ tion and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section sub@@ categories mentioned above . in the dialog options , you can set up complete member groups , i.e. all members of a group set up on a group rather than explained all groups of a medium like in a group . &quot;
&quot; in view the settings possibilities , which can be available to you for the fes@@ tivities , you can choose the category you want to configure . in the left window you can configure the category is a list of the current category and in the right a list of the sub@@ categories . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; divi@@ des his module system with other graphic applications such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module name is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; KDE ; image Plugin Interface . nutri@@ ent information about this can be found on the home page of Ki@@ pi .
&quot; the modules can be accessed via the menu modules . the modules can and are not described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; but most modules have a help page that you can call via the modules itself . &quot;
&quot; since the modules are shared among each other together , it may be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; demo version can always be tested with the demo version . therefore , you should either call these on your own pictures with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu help . say not , I would not have been war@@ ned ! &quot;
&quot; the applications that uses modules over K@@ IP@@ I , are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not function . this is the dis@@ advantage , if you share features with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that are also K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are not supported in albums , there &apos;s an album simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this type of order is not supported by albums , so you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; here &apos;s simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the current album which is just the current view , so all images that you can find the pictures . &quot;
&quot; next to the current album has to pass &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the modules also has been handed over to a list of albums . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s Browser shows the content of a category , for example every person , then each entry of this category is an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will be the category that you have defined in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums , if you want to use the category for example , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so , so if you have selected people to view and give the module this . &quot;
&quot; as some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the Settings dialog and select the range of modules that you will be downloaded . &quot;
&quot; in the picture you can see an example of a screen , as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; as you are used by any other KDE application , you can see the window at the top of a menu and a tool@@ bar . under the tool@@ bar you will find out more information about your pictures , now please click on this window to show you an overview with all existing pictures . &quot;
&quot; one of the main features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the opportunity to see any image with notes . this includes information about the individuals who are shown on the picture , etc . you can set each image either individually or for a larger number of pictures certain notes at the same time . if an example is displayed on all pictures Jes@@ per , and all images are recorded in Copenhagen . &quot;
&quot; all these notes can be used for searching and brow@@ sing , as you can read in the section . if you want to see these notes if you use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; you will see three lists with a text@@ box by using individuals , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as you can always use them again when you enter information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the result of the images is to move the images within the list : if you have a family holiday , and in all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 people can be displayed , so that the names used to be moved up to the top , the people find faster and arrange . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to see a alphabe@@ tical list , click on the icon for sorting by date on the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have chosen comments for each picture individually , you may need to edit all selected images and review these images with comments . click this case easily on the front and back buttons , which are located below the preview of the image on the right . &quot;
&quot; if you have several pictures , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all of these images and use the menu item daily entries at once with a comment . &quot;
&quot; las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California . &quot;
&quot; in the picture you will see a browser window of the USA as a group of view . to show you , it is a group of transl@@ ator , a special icon will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; additionally , you can add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also add an entry to a category or sub@@ category in order to make this one sub@@ category of this entry . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the Radi@@ c@@ alog@@ s by moving the bar , which form the upper part of the frame , click and move . you can also make your own window by taking it out of the window section . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the appearance of the window to suit your needs , click on the button options ... that offers you the possibility to save the current structure and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also leave a frame also completely out . if you want to see this window later , use the button options ... and then you can see windows a / hide . this process will see you in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the entry pictures in your browser , you will find an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or any images if you do not have a filter here . you can configure the size of the thumb@@ nails , by simply clicking on the mouse with the middle mouse button . try it easy . &quot;
&quot; if you have a picture on the background of your desktop , this picture will be set as a background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; when you click on a picture , this is displayed in the image viewer . if you have not opened any window with a picture , will be created a new display window . &quot;
you can also delete pictures in the image . simply select the appropriate pictures from which you want to delete and press the select button or select the window you can see the window you can see in the picture .
&quot; for this problem a solution to . you can also use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; namely pictures also , you can have stored on your hard disk . in the picture you can see the images stored somewhere . in the picture you can see the images of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all necessary images can be downloaded from the hard disk . &quot;
&quot; however , in which the right upper corner is cut , are not stored on the hard disk . this is available for example 1 @-@ 9 . however , the thumb@@ nails will be available , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also view the preview of these pictures . you can also read these pictures with the image viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you want to see this function that you want to copy files from the folders and back again . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you would like to avoid anger , such as the break@@ down of your images , please buy a larger hard disk to save all the pictures . &quot;
&quot; in the menu pictures you will find a sub@@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to make a little more privacy , you want to make the pictures so that at the end of those you want to see for other in@@ accessible , you can also see all the pictures that you can see your little sister and the menu item everything except for current view . &quot;

with the point button you can reset your z@@ oom so that the image is not shown to z@@ zo@@ om@@ t . with the equ@@ ilibrium paste the zo@@ oms so that each pixel corresponds to the screen a pixel of the image .
remember that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations are working with videos that her@@ ein and get out of out with the plus and Min@@ er paste .
with the rotation feature from the context menu you can turn the picture . this does not work with videos . you can make comments on the current picture with the menu item remarks from the context menu .
&quot; if you look at pictures it can happen that you can see a picture with one person , whose name you can forget to look at the picture . in the moment you can see the view and configuration dialog by the image . you will perhaps just move the image to mark and consider some more pictures . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to see the photos on paper . to see what photos you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures and watch them as well or bad , while you are one after the other . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above gives you the viewer the possibility to see pictures with characteristics , while you can view them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by setting the corresponding letter , in which the features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; once you have features of your images , are available to you in your browser . so you can see all the pictures you edit , print or whatever you want to copy , so you can just copy all the pictures to copy the selected images on a CD or whatever you just want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features can be displayed in the thumb@@ nail . if you can view categories in D@@ re pre @-@ view , then you can add features to the pictures by simply click the letter for the feature , after the picture was selected . this can be seen here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case allows you to paint &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; on the image to paint .
the mind is not saved with the image but in the database . on the way you can make your painted later return .
in you can see a picture on the ground level . to turn out the painting menu of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; turn off on the image paint from the context menu . to finish the painter you simply press the cross at the tool@@ bar top of the window .
&quot; to work with &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; you need to operate the application of the program &amp; Pov@@ ray ; not fully domin@@ ate , but the documentation about &amp; Pov@@ ray , you should definitely read and understood . &quot;
&quot; in object , you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object displayed in the po@@ mod@@ ell@@ - views . &quot;
&quot; you can also select several objects simultaneously . but not the object of an already selected object , since all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object to the object , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu item in the menu . &quot;
&quot; there are m@@ eh@@ re possible positions , the following recording menu is displayed in order to select the correct position : &quot;
&quot; with del@@ e@@ tion either from the menu line , edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can previously remove selected objects from the scene . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , click on users to take these changes . then you have invali@@ d values , a message is displayed with a fault description . then you can click the input error and again on users . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user &apos;s documentation in the interior dialog , you can call the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; reference to displayed object with the help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL @-@ Us@@ entation to use this property , you can download it here . &amp; Pov@@ ray , 3.5 also contains the user &apos;s documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the Fe@@ atur@@ ation View . &quot;
&quot; press image in the Fe@@ atur@@ ation view , and a small example of the scene is en@@ alter@@ ed with the selected texture , even if you want to be an extended element ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture @-@ map ) , cru@@ ise locally . &quot;
the screen photo shows the check@@ points of the camera . you can drag these check@@ points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation will be chosen , the control points and it will display a small cross in the wireless model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shi@@ fts . you can change the shift through drag@@ ging with the mouse within the entire window . &quot;
every object has as a platform of visibility . you can specify this value relative to the visual stage of the higher object or as an absolute value . objects are only shown if they are selected or equal to the tool@@ bar of the scene is lower .
&amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; has a window order as default . the object name and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you do not like the standard windows , or if you need any other arrangement , you can save them as desired . you can also change multiple windows regulations and easily change between different arrangements . &quot;
&quot; to an@@ chor a window above or under a present view , drag the approach to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the approach to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then connected to the right or left side of this view and extends over the overall height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange several views over each other , drag the anus in the middle of another view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the kart@@ ing box above . &quot;
&quot; the last possible shut@@ ters are sh@@ ading views : views that are not in the main window . to solve a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the tight@@ er to the desktop or click on the small to the left above the arrow in the An@@ f@@ asser@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the little cross at the An@@ f@@ asser@@ k . to prevent the Cl@@ ose , click on the small square between arrow and the cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional opinions into the main window . in the menu View you can find entries for any kind of views . new views are flo@@ ating , you can take them at any point . &quot;
the current window view can save you with view shut@@ down . it will be shown a dialog in which you can store the window assignment under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ dering it . &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ dering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual has been installed in &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 not supported . &quot;
&quot; to ren@@ ew the current scene , click on the icon Ren@@ dering The icon Ren@@ ders in the tool@@ bar or select the menu view scene . &quot;
&quot; a R@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Pov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determin@@ es the beauty and quality of the ren@@ dering . if you want to insert a scene in different images and quality levels , you can insert any number of R@@ ender @-@ modes , from a quick preview of up to full @-@ pictures . &quot;
if you click on the icon The R@@ ender settings in the tool@@ bar or in the menu view of R@@ ender Mod@@ i ... the following dialogue will be opened :
&quot; each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but sense is a name that leaves the characteristics of the mode . &quot;
in the map size you can enter the width and height of the hot picture . if you just want to add a small area of the image . if you only choose a small area of the picture below and give the image section to ren@@ dering into the input field .
in combination @-@ field quality you can choose the properties which is used &amp; Pov@@ ray ; for ren@@ dering a model with complex multi@@ diff@@ user Refl@@ ections . a detailed description of the R@@ ender features can be found in the user manual for &amp; Pov@@ ray .
&quot; if a picture is saved with just one beam per pixel , there are often different errors in cur@@ ves and lines , also sometimes details are not shown if they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is ali@@ asing . &quot;
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to decrease the influence of these errors . generally see pictures with this property better .
&quot; when you turn anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calculated and connects &amp; Pov@@ ray ; more than one ray each pixel . this technique is called super @-@ samp@@ ling . &quot;
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; supports two methods of the super @-@ samp@@ ling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the super @-@ samp@@ ling the neighbouring pixel . the second method is adap@@ tive and adap@@ tive because each pixel and adap@@ tive because the rec@@ tors are dependent on the measured color values . &quot;
if you choose the first method followed by POV @-@ Ray a beam per pixel . if the difference between the color values over@@ throw the pre@@ determined bel@@ iefs with super @-@ samp@@ ling will be calculated by selecting an particular extra number of pixels with super @-@ samp@@ ling ( 25 ) additional rays of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays of pixels .
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays of pixels . if the difference between the color values over@@ throw the pixels in 4 sub @-@ pixel which can be followed individually and set to further sub @-@ division . the maximum depth of rec@@ ur@@ sion can be set with the low value .
&quot; another possibility of reducing the ali@@ asing effect is that the production of space for the ray process , called J@@ itter@@ ing , changes &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the beams for a tiny amount to avoid regular samples . &quot;
the last setting for quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use Re@@ flex@@ ion . this is an experim@@ ental property of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use of reflex@@ ion . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property .
&quot; on this map menu you can adjust to whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . one pixel is then transparent , if the related rays have not made an object . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window for viewing the &amp; Pov@@ ray . if &amp; Pov@@ ray , is finished , you can find the reason for this . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; Pov@@ ray , select the menu file import ... and select a file in the dialog box . &quot;
&quot; currently , with k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; not yet the full command @-@ catch from &amp; Pov@@ ray ; . if you can perform coll@@ ecting error or war@@ nings , a dialog window will show a list of all reports . &quot;
if you are not supported source code in &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; write this source @-@ text between the two special comments / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ end .
&quot; you can export objects from object in the editor to export the source text for &amp; Pov@@ ray . this adds the source text of the object in the editor . to import objects in the scene , simply mark the source@@ code in the editor and drag it to the object tree . &quot;
with cop@@ ying and paste into &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can insert source text for &amp; Pov@@ ray .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called if &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; a scene is usually ren@@ dered . usually this is Pov@@ ray or x @-@ Pov@@ ray .
&quot; click on the help in the Fe@@ atur@@ ation View , open &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user documentation is displayed here . supports the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; search for external files ( for example al@@ field dates ) to the paths to the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; libraries . if you are not listed in the folder of the scene you will also have to move the path to these files here . if a file is used in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the color for the check@@ points . the second color will be used for viewing the selected check@@ points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for viewing in the camera view and in the window type labels .
&quot; you can set the object @-@ catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wireless model views . you can adjust the grid separately for shi@@ fts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; larger values make a closer contact model and thus a better sewing for the displayed items , but require more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects such as the ball you can adjust the detailed stage for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you give the High Detail@@ view to advanced proj@@ ections , all the addresses will be used for advanced proj@@ ection . advanced proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with excep@@ tions from perspective and vertical proj@@ ections . this property gives a better rap@@ pro@@ ch@@ ement for proj@@ ections , but requires more time to ren@@ dering . &quot;
&quot; if you show wall display , a wall is displayed behind the objects . the wall is shown in a chess bag made of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; when you show floor , a floor below the objects is saved . the floor is shown in a chess bag made of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you activate cant@@ ata , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method for ren@@ dering the scenes . the values for depth and sw@@ elling value can be set . more detailed information about the parameters can be found in the section R@@ ender @-@ Mod@@ i . &quot;
&quot; on this page you can create existing window regulations or create new window regulations . in the section Window , the window lists can create and store windows . &quot;
the Standard @-@ window order : displays all existing window regulations . &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; used the selected window order at the start of the program .
the list of the window regulations shows all existing window regulations . a new arrangement allows you to create and delete a selected arrangement with the button Rem@@ ove .
each window order is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all the views for the chosen window order . new views can set you with the button Add and delete selected views with the button Rem@@ ove .
&quot; the position of the new window . with new column , you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with un@@ ks you get a cart@@ on view together with the present view and flo@@ ating the view not in the main window , but generates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you just have just &amp; Pov@@ ray , and &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to create more exact knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , among recep@@ tion@@ ate very popular : one bul@@ let at one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should consider the following al@@ erts carefully before you compla@@ in about that you as a result can only get a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set the camera , no rules can be applied to the ren@@ dering , as a result you will receive a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have no light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you will get just a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have installed everything error @-@ free , you will see the first start of &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; &quot;
take a little time to get to know the menus and the available symbols of the tool@@ bar . read the documentation that you can expect an appropriate idea what you can expect from this program .
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols now , therefore you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application . &quot;
&amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this instruction , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu item . so you now have a scene without objects . &quot;
&quot; the full model view shows how the camera consi@@ ders the whole scene that you create . in particular , you notice the scene from the view of the camera . this is the result of the scene from the camera . this shows you the result of ren@@ der@@ ns of the scene . &quot;
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry containing the name camera . if you click on , see the content of the Object properties , where the different parameters of the camera can be found in the user &apos;s documentation to &amp; Pov@@ ray . &quot;
&quot; change anything to the basic settings of the camera , this is later instructions reserved , but note that the camera in the view can modify , with which you can change the target of the camera with which you left the target of the camera and drag him to the desired position . &quot;
&quot; if you press the button or press Enter , the wire model and the object @-@ tree immediately change according to these settings . as a result you can see the scene from the view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many possibilities to create the ground for the scene . you could insert a Qu@@ ader ( Insert body Qu@@ ader ) and the size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is an understand@@ able method for sol@@ ving this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; actually offers an simp@@ ler opportunity . you can use an infinite plane as ground :
&quot; a good advice : select the plane in the object , change the name and press the button . in the object name the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wireless model view now shows the level , even at the moment only as a limited end@@ ary level . if you run the scene , extends the level to the horiz@@ on . &quot;
&quot; when you view yourself carefully , you will find that you can click the entry for the ground , if you click on the icon at the bottom . in this case you can see the different parameters of object . in this case you can see the different parameters of object . in this case you can see the different parameters of object . in this case you can see the different parameters of object . in this case you can see the different parameters of object . in this case you can see the different parameters of object . in this case you can see the different parameters of object . in this case you can see the different parameters of object . in this case you can see the different parameters of object . in this case you can see the different parameters of object . in this case you can see one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties . &quot;
&quot; in this scene you should move the soil to exercise a unit under the horizont@@ ally , just so you can get some of these parameters . select the shift and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first choose the floor to set up its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something in the moment something simple . &quot;
&quot; in both cases a dialog box will open up in which you can choose how the object is inser@@ ted in object . please select the name in the Fe@@ atur@@ ation View ( name = bottom @-@ Pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview you see how the pigment gives out now . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of the pig@@ ments only shows a Matt@@ es black material , because you need to check settings for the pigment , so you can always check the appearance of materials always with a click on preview . also there are many possibilities , but take now the easi@@ est . &quot;
&quot; if you do not see color on qu@@ ader and ball , click on the button users and then call the preview . &quot;
the material for the ground is right now correctly . if you get your image now with a click on the icon you should get the following results :
&quot; of course , this is not the color . you are not expected here . in the color list you need to type two new attri@@ butes , called one color . then you can do this entry twice ( you can also do this entry ) , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list may only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; choose in object , or change the colors in the view of the object properties : &quot;
&quot; this step you should have already done this step , as you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; you should have understood as easy as the ground : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the object features you can immediately change the settings . put the value for your radius : to 1 ( forget not to press Enter ) , so that the ball hits contact with the ground . otherwise the ball is flo@@ ating over the ground , as you have moved the ground around a unit down . &quot;
&quot; of course , the Ren@@ dering now gives a wei@@ rd result : how to see before , the spher@@ ical surface seems like a Matt@@ es black material . put in the following step an appropriate material . &quot;
&quot; if you have chosen the ball , you can now have a material to point . as already in the ground , enter the ball a pigment as color : &quot;
&quot; select Now first sub@@ object and change the name for example in the sphere of pig@@ ment . click the ball pig@@ ment , select then colored and create the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; but you can reach the more interesting effects , if you take time to set some finish properties : &quot;
change the values as in the following screen@@ shots and click on users or press Enter .
&quot; the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection are already a partial visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metallic : still not selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of that , which options offer you &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; hopefully you have already learned much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ rus is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
&quot; if you bear a scene of ray@@ trac@@ ing , the ren@@ derer hyp@@ othe@@ tical ray from the perspective of the beh@@ older ( i.e. from the camera that reflected the scenes effects in the scene and like atmosph@@ eric effects such as fo@@ g . thus the scene pixels is processed for pixels . &quot;
&quot; you can imagine you will see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye , with which you look at the scene . without a light source you see nothing , the picture is simply black . obviously need any scene that should be saved , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . Pov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ pov or * .@@ inc .
opens a file . in the standard file dialog you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ;
&quot; whenever you open a new model , the file will be inser@@ ted in this sub@@ menu and replace the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model it is already stored under the same name , it is a new file , you need to enter a name and storage space . &quot;
represents the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are thro@@ wn out .
&quot; this menu item you can only select , if you do not have stored changes in the scene . &quot;
&quot; repe@@ at@@ edly , the most recently revers@@ ed command . this menu item you can only select if you have . &quot;
saves the current window assignment and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new order or an existing layout .
&quot; in this menu you will find options for setting up &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; , here you can change the appearance , the scanning , and the default behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change or add new commands with this option .
opens a dialog to set up the tool@@ bar . you can add this option tool symbols for &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; -@@ commands and remove .
a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a way to add @-@ to smoke without any bump on the surface individually and without the geomet@@ rical form of the object itself .
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file for both B@@ ump @-@ Map as well as for a texture map .
&quot; basic body are simple geomet@@ rical shapes , which you can use as modules : very complex 3D models are generated from do@@ zen or even hundreds of this basic body . these models are then processed , to give them a realistic appearance . &quot;
&quot; a texture map is an opportunity to give the surface of an object color on pixels , by using a file @-@ file as a color card . &quot;
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser where you can choose images for viewing .
pictures can either be displayed in a window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can view with clicking &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the button Return view .
you can adjust whether each image should be displayed in an own window or whether all the images should always use the same window .
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , you simply tap the first character of the filename in the browser window . then a small input field is found in the right bottom corner . you can leave the input field of g@@ aps of return or &amp; Es@@ c ; leave . &quot;
&quot; in the dialogue - &amp; Cu@@ ick@@ show ; there are five cart@@ ons cards . in three of them , general and mach@@ ining and slideshow , you can set the working method of &amp; Cu@@ ick@@ show ; Set in the two others , abbrevi@@ ations for the browser , can be set up the short@@ cut for the respective window . &quot;
&quot; if the picture is selected , then the images are not big enough to fill the screen will be filled with the screen , the rest of the scor@@ eboard is filled with the rear @-@ base . default is not a full @-@ screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point is activated , invites &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already the next picture in the folder you can see the actual picture . this reduces the delay when you choose the next picture and is particularly suitable for slideshow . &quot;
with this option stor@@ ing &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the end the name of the last opened folder . the next start opens &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in browser window .
&quot; click on the colored bal@@ ken to select a rear color . this is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . when in window@@ ed mode the window is bigger than the image , will also be filled with the selected color . &quot;
they can be &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; so set that only a few of the dat@@ at@@ yp@@ es can be shown .
this option is enlar@@ ged for large images of the display window to the full screen . this option is swit@@ ched as default .
sets whether the slideshow with the first image in the folder or with the selected image should begin .
the time @-@ time between the image change in a slideshow . to change the value you can enter a new value into the input field or the sli@@ ders or the small arrows on the right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
&quot; the number of re@@ tries , this value is set to 0 , the slideshow is so long as long until it is canc@@ eled by the user , you can enter a new value into the input field or the sli@@ ders or the small arrows right next to the input field . the default is 1 . &quot;
change here the short@@ cut for the different modes of modes of &amp; cu@@ ick@@ show ; in the boxes of short break for the display and short break for the browser .
&quot; with this option , you turn off between the two @-@ piece view of the file system ( a window for sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window . &quot;
displays great symbols for files in the folder . this ad is only possible in short function .
displays small icons for files in the folder . this ad is only possible in short function .
displays the thumb@@ nails for files in the folder . this ad is only possible in short function .
decre@@ asing the image by 10 % . the factor relates to the current size of the image .
enlar@@ ged the image by 10 % . the factor relates to the current size of the image .
includes the display window for the pictures . &amp; Cu@@ ick@@ show ; is also closed if no browser window will open more .
the image in the original size . this is only mean@@ ing@@ ful when automatic sc@@ aling is activated .
&quot; opens the input field for completion . enter the first sign of the filename , which you are looking for . if the file is found , it is selected . &quot;

the user can select the scanner and click OK to open the scanner . Cancel
further settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) covers these options not especially .
&quot; in order to start a picture , the user can start a pre @-@ outlet can start and then because scanning range for the final scan will be started by the preview @-@ button . &quot;
to select the image the user can get into the image and from the current selection out zo@@ om@@ es . it can also be able to adjust the complete preview into the window .
when the picture has been selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
&quot; if the stor@@ ing a preview may be displayed in the settings , then the image is displayed in a stem cell , then appears , then the picture will be saved and lie down to a break@@ through and you will go back to the main window . &quot;
&quot; by the kno@@ b settings , the same name is opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the image if desired , prior to s@@ ali@@ ps . in this case the option must display a preview of the memory . if this preview of the user is not required , then the option must be chosen . &quot;
this setting allows them to select the way as &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; pictures stores the dialog for each image opens the dialog in front of each un@@ ges@@ tic@@ ed picture . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; this automatically must be saved with an generated name in a previously defined folder and then you need to ask you without your filename .
&quot; this setting defines where the pictures are stored in the option stor@@ ing without after a filename , then this folder will be saved as default for dialogue for stor@@ ing . the default is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... change . &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines a sc@@ fix for the automatically stor@@ ing images and is also the proposed name for the image in dialogue for stor@@ ing . the automatically stored image gets a numer@@ ical Su@@ ff@@ ix the jed@@ es@@ mal high level , when a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers . &quot;
&quot; the user can adjust the storage of image quality . this value also changes the comp@@ ression @-@ value when saving . if Select the image quality is not selected , then the default value is used by Q@@ t . &quot;

&quot; select like all other programs keyboard short@@ cut . below you can set up a list of this pump@@ kin and their function . the global keyboard short@@ cut can set up , by selecting the right mouse button in the player @-@ window , click and select &quot;
you may be able to set up existing multimedia keys so that they work as &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok . this allows you to make your keyboard for the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Control Center .
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions , which are mostly used in other KDE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context , play@@ lists , play@@ lists and scripts . &quot;
Amar@@ o@@ ok supports the command @-@ line options of Q@@ t and &amp; KDE ; . additionally , Amar@@ ok has some own command @-@ line options . &quot;
&quot; you should give the user to give a feedback , if the script is not executed for a lack of depend@@ ency . please check in your script , whether all required modules are available and use dialog with the user , why a script does not run . &quot;
begin of &apos; Kor@@ un@@ dum &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Kor@@ un@@ dum ( KDE bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit
&quot; in the folder suggest / templates , you can use a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a basis for your own scripts or they simply to determine the required functions . you will quickly find that the writing of Scrip@@ ts is relatively simple . &quot;
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P can control your script data using amar@@ ok . the easi@@ est way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; which should be both KDE @-@ installation .
most scripts can enable the util@@ isation of external programs and commands . it is usually used the function ex@@ ec ( ) in this way can be called d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively simple . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; send fax@@ es to all running scripts . this is why Str@@ ings are constantly monitor and react according to events . of course , a script the events should also ignore the events if there is no use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure the script to display the setup dialog . to save the memory and loading of the furnish@@ ing data , each script has to be started , Amar@@ o@@ ok the work@@ bench to the folder , where all data should be saved . &quot;
track@@ change sign@@ alized that a new piece is played . the script could now be &amp; z@@ B ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions to ask for further information on the new piece ( for example the met@@ ad@@ ata or the quantity ) .
vol@@ um@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume sign@@ ali@@ zes a change of volume . the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100 .
&quot; custom@@ is@@ Click@@ ed : sub@@ menu item@@ Tit@@ le , reve@@ aling the path to the selected files of the playlist , you can identify the link to the selected files of the playlist , allowing the script to remove the ground@@ ed entry . to add a entry to the ground@@ ed entry . to the menu you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Menu@@ Item ( Sub@@ menu item@@ Tit@@ le ) . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok , stop , or if the user stops a script , sending &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should work to be done , for example the memory of data or configuration settings . &quot;
Amar@@ oks script management can also install script packages that have downloaded the user &amp; z@@ B ; from a web server . we recommend a Archi@@ ve@@ 2 ( .b@@ z@@ 2 ) , which can also be comp@@ ressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .b@@ z@@ 2 ) , which may also be comp@@ ressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .b@@ z@@ 2 ) that users can recognize the archive clearly as Amar@@ ok script . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will accept the script packages with the revers@@ ing amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason you should feel right to correct your script packages .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining for di@@ schar@@ ging modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file right : &quot;
&quot; if your script package is ready , you can upload it on www.k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.org , and follow the link to the wiki script page of &amp; Amar@@ ok . you should use the category Amar@@ ok , script . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a audio player for &amp; KDE ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and is still surpris@@ ingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; Amar@@ ok , you can easily pull music into the playlist rather than through endless menus . perhaps you can also find a very specific titles from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos; s collective @-@ browsers and the quick search you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but can never decide what you want to hear ? then the playlist is still difficult for you . and if the decision is still hard to choose the dynamic mode and the smart playlist , automatically select the correct music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ o@@ ok has an excellent support for Ap@@ ples iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many generic USB devices . also , so you can listen to your music . these and many more useful functions make Amar@@ o@@ ok to advanced audio player . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to experience your music again ! &quot;

&quot; relative paths to manually stored play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , will be able to use &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the storage place of the playlist . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files are stored . &quot;
&quot; up to the current piece be visible when the piece of change appears to be visible , that the play@@ lists can hold the window / ab@@ ras@@ lt to keep the current piece always in the visible window . &quot;
&quot; if the change @-@ change is automatically switch to the context @-@ browser automatically displays the context @-@ browser , once the next piece is played . &quot;
in the section section you can adapt to Amar@@ ok ; s App@@ ear@@ ance . the section is divided into three parts .
in the fonts section you can use the use of various scrip@@ tures in &amp; Amar@@ ok . you can select the use of different fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok . you can select fonts for the following area : play@@ lists @-@ windows , player @-@ windows and context @-@ browsers . click on Select ... , so you can choose a desired font from the selection dialog . &quot;
with the selection of custom@@ ised colour scheme you also have the qu@@ al of your choice and can specify a separate color scheme . use it including ac@@ tivi@@ zed color @-@ fl@@ ator for for@@ e- and rear @-@ color .
&quot; play at the start continue that &amp; Amar@@ ok , after the program start playing automatically with the piece at the spot , continue with which they stopped at the final end . &quot;
the sub@@ window On @-@ Screen display enables you to use the un@@ lock of the O@@ SD . if On @-@ screen display is shown to view a preview of the O@@ SD and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview .
&quot; the first option is the font . click here to select ... to select the desired font for the O@@ SD . the door @-@ box shade affects that the text in the O@@ SD sh@@ ady is shown . &quot;
&quot; custom colors used , gives you the opportunity to adapt the O@@ SD colors for font and background . one click on the color @-@ surfaces opens the dialog for the color selection . if the colors used is not enabled to use the pres@@ t &amp; KDE . &quot;
the input field display represents the text displayed in the O@@ SD . clicking the O@@ SD can be adjusted to your own needs . below you will find a list of available wild@@ card and what they mean .
the option screen is intended for X@@ in@@ ama users . that allows you to specify on which screen a multi @-@ monitor environment is to appear .
the card @-@ card audio output lets you select a audio driver from the sel@@ ector area . some drivers will enable further insights in this cart@@ on card .
the map @-@ card collection is used for furnish@@ ing all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of the database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to music files as well . to insert a folder into the collection . this section contains the cross @-@ cru@@ ise fields , as well as with the selected folders . &quot;
sub@@ folder re@@ kur@@ si@@ v search : this means that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the registry and their sub@@ folders according to music as well .
&quot; changing changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok , to monitor the selected folder to change ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . furthermore , an incre@@ mental search is performed , in order to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
&quot; play@@ lists : causes that &amp; Amar@@ ok , all found play@@ lists in your collection ( .@@ pl@@ - and .m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection will then be added later in the play@@ lists . &quot;
the part collectors database is used to select a database for the collection . the combinations field driver : lets you select between sql@@ ite or My@@ S@@ ql . if My@@ S@@ ql is selected to set up a further institution in the My@@ S@@ ql setting .
&quot; the My@@ S@@ ql @-@ setup is used for inser@@ tion the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok , using calcul@@ ator : will be able to enter the My@@ S@@ ql database . afterwards , the database is accessible by the database . name : is the database name to which the connection is made . &quot;
use username : and password : to the input data required to connect to the database .
the map @-@ card last@@ .@@ fm is the support for last@@ .@@ fm . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the names can be stored on a last@@ .@@ fm server and create music recommendations with respect to the current numbers .
&quot; here , enter your username and password for your di@@ schar@@ .@@ fm profile . if you have no profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ fm website . &quot;
&quot; stored pieces and so the profile update : this setting allows us &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok , to transfer the names of the played pieces of your di@@ schar@@ .@@ fm profile . &quot;
&quot; similar interpre@@ ters : after activation of this setting is being &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list with similar interpre@@ ters will be retri@@ eved , you can see the list in the context of your browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ fm &apos;s Profile to use this feature . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ B ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of the functions and gallery with screen @-@ photos .
Amar@@ ok only needs the package K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no further KDE packages . you have to have K@@ deli@@ bs therefore installed ( including those contained ther@@ ein ( including Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to be used for example modules or scripts ) . we have comp@@ ile a small guide on how to comp@@ ile K@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
&quot; some functions such as the O@@ SD pres@@ upp@@ oses that your window manager will set the relevant standards of driv@@ es@@ ect@@ .org . Gn@@ ome is thus functioning , but flu@@ x@@ box will be used for example , we try to use Amar@@ o@@ ok on all platforms , therefore we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these represent an excellent development environment . &quot;
&quot; probably one of your files will make a bug in the t@@ agli@@ b library to days . you can browse these errors to the t@@ agli@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an.@@ log . then , you can delete these errors to the t@@ agli@@ b developers under bu@@ gg@@ k@@ de@@ .org . then you can delete the file and create the collection again . &quot;
&quot; mostly , this is that t@@ agli@@ b is short@@ ened in reading the Meta information from this file . please tell these errors to the t@@ agli@@ b developers under bu@@ c@@ de@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , then try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &quot;
&quot; ensure that all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; they have compiled libraries with the same comp@@ iler version . if for example &amp; Amar@@ ok , with G@@ CC 3.4 , t@@ agli@@ b , but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ x comp@@ ile , then this leads to falling at the processing of Meta information . &quot;
&quot; if you use KDE with blu@@ ff , then de@@ activate fl@@ ap if in@@ active for ... in setting up the sound system , or use at least not a value of 1 second . &quot;
you can also send us the Back@@ tra@@ ce by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail opens automatically with a cr@@ ash ) and send us a good back@@ tra@@ ce will be send us a good back@@ tra@@ ce .
&quot; this is because many program can write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 into the Meta information , but do not know as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib@@ - &gt; new ( $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib@@ - &gt; new ( $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UTF8 ) ; &quot;
this script requires Perl @-@ Module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random version ) see in KDE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the tool@@ bar can simply be forgotten . this is a well known bug in KDE 3.@@ 4.0 . please note the status qu@@ ables on grey and semi @-@ transparent . please note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol until this setting will show their effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : unlimited symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map . this can be viewed if Amar@@ ok the correct Q@@ t library . this can be viewed with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p Q@@ t .
to fix these errors you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ating Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf that Amar@@ o@@ is the correct version first .
there are some possibilities . most installation problems clari@@ fy the light@@ est by the help of a experts in your Uni@@ x@@ - or Linux distribution . you can also use help with other users or among the developers . use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help to search . please enter there only one error if you get something about the bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; there will be a blank playlist . how to get music inside ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to keep the surface intuitive , the start is converted to statistics window . you can find it under extr@@ as statistics . &quot;
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ o@@ 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are available for the rating by the user while the points are loaded automatically .
&quot; to assess pieces , the playlist should be displayed in the playlist and select column review . click anywhere in the new rating column , to set the rating for a piece . you can also use the short@@ cut out Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
select the files that you want to remove and then press Ent@@ f on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your choice and then choose the playlist from the cut @-@ up menu .
drag a playlist file with the mouse in the playlist and let them drop there exactly how to make it with other files . so easy it is : - )
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , right next to the addition button , is the button playlist . click on it . &quot;
&quot; pres@@ um@@ ably , you need the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config . install the package x@@ mm@@ s @-@ dev@@ el and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . take a look at lib@@ visual , this package contains a lot of very nice visu@@ alis@@ ations . &quot;
the E@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . also you can find it via the menu@@ bar under extr@@ as E@@ quali@@ zer ....
&quot; no . yes , that is true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used one of the back@@ end independent approach , therefore , the real question of the world @-@ guy supports G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ D ? . as you see , we can even support text and PNG ? G@@ Stream@@ er can even support text and PNG ! &quot;
&quot; maybe use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which will be supplied with no MP3 de@@ coder ( from patent legal reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ hat mp3 KDE , Enter &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s ab : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ Stream@@ er driver with the Al@@ sa @-@ sink , the device must use a bl@@ ender ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software @-@ bl@@ ender ) . look at the support D@@ mix for AL@@ SA . &quot;
the issue of this command should help you find the problem for a problem and a solution . for G@@ Stream@@ er you need to specify another S@@ ink ( e.g. os@@ ss@@ ink ) .
&quot; this does &amp; Amar@@ ok , already . do not forget that media first have to be de@@ ded . G@@ Stream@@ er is the best choice when you are using a de@@ coder with little over@@ head . G@@ Stream@@ er reads the file , de@@ ded it and sends the PC@@ M @-@ data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
X@@ M@@ MS declar@@ es the data first . G@@ Stream@@ er can give directly to AL@@ SA exactly as well as x@@ ine .
&quot; use either the G@@ Stream@@ er driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound @-@ System . enable Sound@@ server with highest priority ( real @-@ time strength ) and increase the size of the sound buff@@ er ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ sw@@ rap@@ per su@@ id is set : &quot;
&quot; with KDE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia code@@ cs , which can cause further play . read this error report . the magni@@ fication of the Sound buff@@ er in your AL@@ SA @-@ setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ and@@ rc can also help them well . &quot;
&quot; either do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stream@@ er or x@@ ine , or install KDE @-@ Multimedia completely to get the quick@@ er Arts code@@ cs ( li@@ mer@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ lib.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; pres@@ um@@ ably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver ) , or reduce the size of the Arts @-@ buff@@ er in control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buff@@ er , the less applications respond . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it . &quot;
G@@ Stream@@ er is installed but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stream@@ er driver , cr@@ ashes &amp; Amar@@ ok . why ? &quot;
after installation of G@@ Stream@@ er you need to register all the components . perform g@@ st register to register all the G@@ Stream@@ er components .
read the G@@ Stream@@ er FAQ . if that does not help you can also ask at IR@@ C -@@ Channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try to use this ( complete Amar@@ o@@ ok before ! ) : - Download you ff@@ mp@@ eg and install it . run the module folder of G@@ Stream@@ er all ff@@ mp@@ eg files ( you will find the module folder with g@@ st config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run g@@ st register again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok .
please tell of it at bu@@ gg@@ k@@ de.@@ org@@ . if you have a complete list on proposals / wishes you send it to our mail@@ ing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ dev@@ el @ list@@ s.@@ source@@ forge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic K ... : ) &quot;
&quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P is already possible , set a alarm on your calendar program and run it with the alarm to this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play &quot;
&quot; this command can be combined &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; it is certain that &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok , running before you go to bed , then you are awak@@ ened by the gentle tones of music that you have been stopped in front of the bed . &quot;
how to get up to date in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running tracks if you are on another computer ?
if a functioning SSH environment is available , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you interpre@@ t and title of the current piece : SSH -@@ I ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ user name Amar@@ ok player now@@ Play@@ ing &quot;
replace IP @-@ address with your IP and your username with your username . this requires advance that your identification in the file ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA is available .
&quot; the visu@@ alis@@ ations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ ok , window . click on the keyboard and the current Analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size changing windows . &quot;
the combination of Ctr@@ l + Rights mouse button provides a piece in the cli@@ pping sequence into the queue . by pressing the input . the first search results will be played and the search result .
&quot; OK , the player @-@ window and the playlist have tri@@ cky functions , but what about the icon in the system section of the control bar ? &quot;
&quot; click with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select , which browser should be displayed . &quot;
&quot; my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is located on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok , the collection database cannot be created and on the console does not appear a lot of watch , which now ? &quot;
the internal SQ@@ Lite database from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you have to left ~ / .k@@ r / share / apps / Amar@@ ok on a local drive or use amar@@ o@@ K@@ s MySQL support .
&quot; put the CD a , then click on the menu on audio CD . it opens up a file @-@ browser with multiple folder . for normal reading , select a few pieces and drag them into the desired target folder in a con@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic co@@ ding you instead take files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g . &quot;
&quot; Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; SELE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ ated@@ ates , and F@@ ROM ) &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ( url ) ; &quot;
&quot; basically , this fits the previous assessment with a decre@@ asing value based on how often the play was played , the less influence it has played on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can select the review for a piece of yourself by clicking on a split bank in the play@@ lists . then , you can select the rating of a piece of click on the click and edit button . you can edit the review or edit them in the dialog box . &quot;
the developers do not want to present to you when you have to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : KDE packages have a defined release plan of the plan of Amar@@ ok .
&quot; this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok , but some users can also find ner@@ vi@@ g . de@@ activate the option icon at the play@@ back in general settings . &quot;
the analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select settings tool@@ bars and take the desired changes there .
&quot; Download a design , or create your own . install this then below Amar@@ o@@ ok , App@@ ear@@ ance context @-@ browser design , click on new design .... &quot;
the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) to avoid difficulty . to avoid difficulty it was removed .
&quot; the cross @-@ section Navigation range allows you to display monitoring and control of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok , while you can display Con@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to display the navigation area . click on the button Settings ( the top ) and select Add Amar@@ ok . &quot;
Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler is a free service to be sent on how to be played on an independent server . the service is free and you need only a free username and a password . Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ ble@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok ;
&quot; if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of down@@ lin@@ t@@ els , and thus also a lot of error reports . &quot;
&quot; pres@@ um@@ ably &amp; Amar@@ ok , comp@@ ile , before you have installed x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine does not comp@@ ile . you need to configure and install . &quot;
&quot; now I have been &amp; Amar@@ ok , new installed , but the exhaust header does not appear again . and now ? &quot;
&quot; pres@@ um@@ ably you use a distribution which are installed by the actual program . although G@@ Stream@@ er is installed , the same applies to x@@ ine you need to install x@@ ine @-@ dev@@ el . after that you need to comp@@ ile and install . &quot;
I get the mistake G@@ Stream@@ er @-@ Critical * * : factory for &apos; ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stream@@ er was compiled with Pr@@ el@@ ess@@ er and it is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stream@@ er . you must comp@@ ile G@@ Stream@@ er without prints . a tip of mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : use no L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you comp@@ ile Amar@@ ok .
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mi@@ met@@ ype audi@@ a / mp4 , even though the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed . &quot;

I have a second sound@@ card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use Amar@@ o@@ ok the second sound@@ card ?
&quot; under settings Amar@@ ok , enter ... audio output enter the device one . typical for example H@@ W : 0 for the default sound@@ card and H@@ W : 1 for the second . &quot;
here you can see an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ rc on a machine with one on@@ board AC@@ 97 @-@ code@@ c and a USB audio device :
&quot; pc@@ m.@@ smart 8x@@ 0 { type plug slav@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; &quot; H@@ W : 0 &quot; } ct@@ l.@@ smart@@ 8x@@ 0 { type H@@ W card 0 } pc@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug slav@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; H@@ W : 1 &quot; } ct@@ l.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type H@@ W card 1 }
&quot; enter the setup dialog from x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output takes place on the USB @-@ sound@@ card . so @-@ lib takes care of the conversion of the samp@@ lers , channels and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the tick on sound@@ track . &quot;
&quot; sorry , but the audio issue with Arts will not continue to support . you may of course take care of this problem . if you like , you may need the new as urg@@ ently needed car@@ egi@@ ver for arts : ) &quot;

&quot; the playlist used by &amp; Amar@@ ok , is the most developed playlist of all for &amp; KDE ; available multimedia player . it has many functions that exists in no other player . however , they are not easy to use it from the abund@@ ance of functions , they are all easy to use . &quot;
&quot; the play@@ lists can be divided into two main areas , on the left hand side is the navigation area . in the navigation area , you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist , such as the context . the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users . &quot;
&quot; context @-@ browser displays different information regarding the current product . its appearance can be adapted with the help of context @-@ browser designs . the context @-@ browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and interpre@@ t . these three sub@@ window will later explain in detail in detail . &quot;
&quot; if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you might have noticed that the sub@@ window will have been selected for other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok . besides , the information can be collected in the statistics window ( extr@@ as statistics ) . &quot;
the window of music shows information about the right current piece as well as the interpre@@ ters and the album .

&quot; under the Music@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon you will find more information about the current piece . you see here , how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its assessment . &quot;
&quot; if you view images in the same folder as the current piece is . file formats .jpg , .@@ j@@ peg , gif and .png are also supported . the pictures can display any names , but pictures with the word front in the name will also be discussed . the context @-@ browser may also be downloaded and embedded in I@@ D3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot;
&quot; the nearest area , Recomm@@ ended pieces , lists several suggested pieces on . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be immediately played . &quot;

&quot; if you want to search for a piece , which does not include a specific keyword , ask a min@@ us sign in front of the term : -@@ something is looking for pieces , which is something not included . &quot;
you can combine these syn@@ thi vari@@ anten according to Bel@@ i@@ eben . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bath . this is looking for all the pieces that either Mike Old@@ field or have a higher rating than 50 and not contain the comment .

opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ R@@ W . thus you can delete all the content or parts of a CD @-@ R@@ W .
&quot; opens the dialog to form a DVD . with this dialogue you can form@@ att@@ ing a DVD ± R ( W ) , making the content completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the writing modules and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; bur@@ ns a previously defined CD @-@ image . the dialog ask for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source that then immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
burning a previously saved DVD image . the dialog ask for a * .@@ is@@ o file as data source which then be burned through g@@ aps of the burning button .
&quot; a previously selected DVD @-@ Video can be converted . this dialog window will be used usually after reading a DVD in the event , but can also be easily used for changing video , code settings and even possibilities for changing the size and to cut black . &quot;
&quot; shows information about the self @-@ occas@@ i@@ onal medium . this information is shown in the event , as well as the properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
displays a list of tool@@ bars by &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; . if an entry is displayed is the tool@@ bar currently visible in the main window .
&quot; if this is crossed , a small strip at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not specified , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view one or out . the folder view is an overview of your folder and the CD / DVD running drives . CD / DVD drives , there is also a context menu with features such as media information , locking and un@@ lock the tool . &quot;
&quot; the contents can be downloaded or from . the event , you can select and drag files into the project view . the event @-@ view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
swit@@ ched the head@@ line in the project view or out . the head@@ line is a nar@@ ro@@ wer area that contains only visible when the project view open projects contains . the head@@ stock has no real function , it looks just pretty out and separ@@ ates the project view clearly from the rest of the views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog window to change the key@@ pad for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after one of the available commands may be selected in the upper part , one can adjust the keyboard order for this . &quot;
&quot; this will start the K@@ 3@@ b ; furnishings for burning CDs and DVDs can be adjusted , so you will need to enter the sys@@ log rights , so you must enter the password for the system for@@ ter ( root ) . &quot;
opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; here you can function general program . almost all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should work on request . this dialog is intended to person@@ alize and evaluate the program .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is how many other &amp; KDE ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface you can be controlled parts of the functionality for example via a shell script .
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , you can either use the command line d@@ co@@ p , or that is a little more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are generally identical , therefore your taste and type of your tasks is crucial to indicate which the programs you give . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we take that you use the command line d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , you have to make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; then enter a bit like the following on the console : &quot;
&quot; besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , which are all &amp; KDE ; -@@ program measured , supported &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts which are described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; features functions such as copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other functions for creating new projects . &quot;

&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ X@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref ( K@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can get a project over the command line by # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b @-@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project .

&amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; is an audio @-@ CD ; -@@ Aus@@ les@@ er for &amp; KDE ; . with him you can easily read audio CD ; s can be read and stored in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . other formats are possible depending on the En@@ coder that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; is the user interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; -@@ data in WAV files on the hard disk ) and from many code files ( comp@@ ression ) . currently l@@ ame for OG@@ G@@ s and FLA@@ C ( comp@@ ressed comp@@ ression ) are currently being installed from the Linux distribution ( comp@@ ression ) . additional codi@@ fiers can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
&quot; first , the title of the &amp; CD ; read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( mixed and comp@@ ressed ) ; and then
will be comp@@ ressed in a second step this WAV files ( usually one per title ) comp@@ ressed to the MP@@ 3- or OGG format or also available in other formats like the ver@@ lu@@ st@@ free FLA@@ C .
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost any distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed . &quot;
&quot; for the second step must be installed ( for MP3 ) , O@@ gg@@ Vor@@ bis ( for OGG ) or other codi@@ les already exists , it is therefore very likely not necessary to comp@@ ile yourself . but if for example FLA@@ C is not used , the installation is not required . &quot;
which co@@ ul@@ sion / file format is to be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer is a small introduction by Ko@@ di@@ erer , Audio quality and comp@@ ressing factors . &quot;
&quot; a word for cop@@ ying of protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia , if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; this program is not possible to avoid any cop@@ ying sound ; self not simply avoid the mechanisms of cop@@ ier@@ protected audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while the set has to be made only once ( the interior dialog can be found ) , but it is often called for a suitable configuration . this leads ( hopefully ) to the understanding of a &amp; CD ; to the disk &apos;s hard disk . this leads ( hopefully ) to the understanding of the slim approach to the user interface , which you will often ask at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert in many formats - depending on which code files are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; information from the driv@@ eth@@ ear@@ b from the internet or can work completely without network , whereby everything is manually recorded . &quot;
&quot; this is only a brief list of the commands of the main window . on the page step by step , you will find more information about how this program is used as well as screen@@ shots of the tab for the configuration of the program . &quot;
&quot; laun@@ ching the CD@@ DB request of the CD data according to the setup of request in the CD@@ DB tab ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case must first be established using the Internet first . ) &quot;
start reading and - if a En@@ coder can be configured in the tab connector - the co@@ ding .
opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available En@@ coder that can be read with another En@@ coder as the default . it is to be noted that before the En@@ coder has been configured in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager so that an already selected file is selected instead of a full &amp; CD ; except for a full &amp; CD .
&quot; opens up the setup dialog to configure the type of notifications ( such as prot@@ ocol@@ s , Pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for programming events ( how to read the &amp; CD ; ended ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main @-@ ger dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; with different card cards ( like En@@ coder , for the setup of the En@@ co@@ ders ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , co@@ generation and comp@@ ression rati@@ os , and helps you choose the right code . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information should be lost , a ver@@ lu@@ st@@ free audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C , there are also other such as &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; Mon@@ key &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the cons are the low comp@@ ression rati@@ os and hardly available commercial devices that can restore these files . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats , the information generated by data comp@@ ression depending on their psych@@ o@@ acoustic model , are MP3 and OGG the most frequent . OGG may have a s@@ light advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower Bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but over this bit@@ rate will generate differences less important , because both Ko@@ di@@ ers are very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still free with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions &quot;
+ high up to very high quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) but compared with OGG slightly deeper quality for deeper bit@@ rates .
&quot; OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer @-@ based music system , and / or if one of the few existing OGG controller is available . &quot;
&quot; MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB Stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car @-@ stereo systems . today - initially , these units are only supporting the MP3 format . &quot;
a short list of parameters to the audio @-@ quality and the comp@@ ression rati@@ os for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually provide transparency for most people and most of musicians accept transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , comp@@ ression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex musicians and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps CB@@ R , comp@@ ression rate about 5.5 . always takes 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a Tit@@ le . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps CB@@ R common stereo , comp@@ ression rate approximately 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of young people , portable devices and Auto@@ stere@@ otypes . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et Ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps CB@@ R . this setting will be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information that are manually entered or controlled by the program automatically , are available as a list of parameters . you can be given / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; and the enco@@ ding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with a enco@@ ding programs , there is often a combination of programming orders for the codi@@ fiers and these parameters here . the manual or the help of the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; e.g. to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keywords ( English : day ) to add MP@@ 3@@ s with l@@ ame , the switch is removed from l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; parameters used to be used ( = Kn@@ op@@ f@@ uses in Assistant ) :
&quot; this is what the driv@@ eth@@ ear@@ b is : a free database , in the person you can download the audio CDs , so that all of the information you can download in the computer : &amp; CD ; title , artist , names of pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I am not law@@ yer , but I am not law@@ yer . however , nobody can prevent the author of the &amp; CD ; nothing or less worth@@ less , so the information can be attached to the music or less ; but all the information can be attached to the music or less ; business , physical or virtual . &quot;
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; an anti @-@ mail address is used as which can be used in a system with another ( f@@ ake ) address as which cannot be used in the system . in this type of configuration , it appears , the e @-@ mail address will not be used by the server ( this can only know the programmer . ) &quot;
&quot; there are available in many countries copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; for the use of driv@@ eth@@ ear@@ b , the geographical coverage is to be used in the next placement server . this saves a range of network and slides the load between the computers . &quot;
a visit to App@@ reci@@ k.@@ provides a current list of mirr@@ ors for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during the reading of a &amp; CD ; or alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually monthly ) only the updates of the database . &quot;
which exec@@ ute program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; if you want to know more accur@@ ately in source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio @-@ CD ; see that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package has to be installed when this is not yet done .
&quot; for stor@@ ing the selected WAV files can be selected for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( OG@@ D ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( OG@@ G@@ s ) and FLA@@ C ( a ver@@ lu@@ st@@ free comp@@ ression for audio data ) on the tab . other co@@ oter can be added to this tab . &quot;
the co@@ erer package must be installed by the Linux distribution before the code . this is also required for pre@@ defined codi@@ fiers . more information about Ko@@ di@@ fier can be found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a code you can get more information about his switch as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a con@@ soles . it must be replaced by the name of the installed enco@@ ding .
&quot; that can have many causes . check out the device of the device recording of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drives , and whether both cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ r@@ c for OG@@ G@@ s , fl@@ ac &amp; etc ; ) . try to give both programs using a command line in a terminal . this could be an indication of what is wrong . &quot;
check if you do not want to read a copy audio CD ; check out the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with a step by step examples . even if you use other settings , this can give tips as you have to move . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , everything understood , but are somehow still uns@@ afe what to do is ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by example , and you will get enough information to set those areas exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , everything set up and our first &amp; CD ; Read about MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and I@@ D3@@ v@@ 1 keyword ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; there must be cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already available on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled package for your Linux distribution , as it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files as it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , what you can of course always do . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you have scre@@ aming that ( eg ; by trying to copy something into the con@@ quer@@ or something ) .
the first section covers the fundamental set @-@ up of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; something which will probably be done once and
the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD ; what has to be repeated for each out &amp; CD ;
&quot; here we define the codi@@ fiers to comp@@ ressing the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . it will be determined where the files are stored , we share the program with , the order to use the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet . &quot;
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change it with any reading of a &amp; CD ; if once the suitable settings are found . &quot;
the device record is transferred to the read@@ able program to read it the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
&quot; frequently , / dev / c@@ dro@@ m is a symbo@@ lic link to the actual instrument of your drive . if this is not working or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD Drive can also be specified in the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt to add existing entries of the device records for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
the card @-@ card General settings . here you can not do much to do . here you can see an additional conversion . in our example everything will be shown as shown in the screen photo .
only when in@@ complete information please select so that you will be informed if you are missing if you are missing on the tools of keywords ( tags ) .
the card @-@ card CD ; settings . just choose both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet of a invent@@ ory computer .
note : the computer must be connected during the reading of the &amp; CD ; it can be connected to the internet so that he can access the IP servers .
&quot; the second sel@@ ector is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry found immediately , the read of the &amp; CD ; this is with less risk associated with the database entry and the resulting folder name / filename or filename is modified and the ID@@ 3 tags with Kid@@ 3 , the &amp; KDE . tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , if you want to type it manually : if you want to manually type it in offshore mode , you can use the database previously . however , you can use this twice as if it is worth it . in order to order the two excer@@ pts are selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following map card . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is provided for us . these are settings for the data @-@ inquiry , for the retri@@ eval of the &amp; CD ; information on the Internet . how white the system , which data is to get the CD ? read the section on foot@@ b . put everything as it is displayed in screen photo . &quot;
mode : we do not have downloaded the database and we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to page and look after a reflection server in your area . this way the burden will be distributed between the computers . this setting will be first attempt to function .
&quot; both work equally related to the server , as many fire@@ walls of the protocol 88@@ 80 , is perhaps more fortun@@ ate with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to sur@@ f on the internet . &quot;
in this example we do not want to submit a &amp; CD ; data to the driv@@ eth@@ b server should be de@@ activate .
simply take the settings from the screenshot . ( make sure that the folder / tmp on your computer exists )
&quot; number at the same time passes , sorry , there is one reason why is more than one at the same time when just an existing drive ? parallel reading and enco@@ ding ? the author knows it not , therefore simply try . &quot;
CD ; after reading the last piece : cru@@ ise this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
&quot; custom files for temporary files : if you do this an@@ chor , then the path must be stored in which the WAV files are not specified if you do not forget to do this folder if you want to make this folder something with the WAV files . &quot;
&quot; everything that type as it is on the screen photo . the command is something long , under circumstances something must be left after right . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned before , it is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good Hi@@ Fi stereo system . it is sufficient for approximately 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved comp@@ ression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and storage . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ tion the production of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; I@@ D3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if needed . Kid@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; KDE ; in case of later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as in the screen photo . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of simultaneously enco@@ ded WAV files : with a dual @-@ core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to co@@ ding more than a WAV file at the same time .
&quot; this is , we just have the basic establishment of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; finished . this configuration is chosen as default for any reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organiz@@ ational structure of your music , you will never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; in this section is described , as the process of reading the &amp; CD ; we will create MP3 files , as we are conveniently located in the prec@@ eding section , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from which point is described , the process of which is described in this section , has to be repeated for each out &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; as we have a &amp; CD ; use which is not yet included in the time , the screen@@ shots see a little differently than that for a &amp; CD ; with successful of driv@@ eth@@ ear@@ ed data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually enter , rather than they get out of the Internet . comments will be shown on the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this examples . it is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this is not yet happened , now the &amp; CD has to be defined in the drive that is defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment the pieces and length of the window should be listed in the window , as in the screen photo . this only when the &amp; CD ; as Audio @-@ CD was able to be identified and by cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
if this does not occur then you are looking for the following questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
&quot; Attention : if the &amp; CD ; successful from the driv@@ eth@@ ear@@ b could be fet@@ ched , all the titles of the pieces are already filled and also the name of the artist and the album will be shown . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than an entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window set up , and you can select the database entry that your opinion is best to your &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; if you have not selected the cru@@ iser for automatic query ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialogue for settings ) , you can also manually set it manually by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you have no local database , but the data from the Internet you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - input of the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screenshot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
&quot; the artist must no longer be given in the input field &quot; &quot; Cur@@ rent title &quot; , &quot; unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece . &quot;
the lower comment field can be used for individual comments ini@@ dic@@ ally per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments who are common for all the pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; Attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the driv@@ eth@@ ear@@ b , the CD @-@ Editor is not empty , but it already contains a good idea to start the content of the CD editor . however , it is always a good idea to begin with the artist and album name ( such as if all words with letters letter or not ... ) , but also to consider whether there are any un@@ wanted notes . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example we use only I@@ D3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this is limited the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and at only 28 characters for the commentary box . this option allows you to adjust a look at the tab , you can take a look at the section &apos; basic settings &apos; . &quot;
you can change the tag information of the generated files later at any time with the tag editor . Kid@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files with it you can also create I@@ D3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
tags are not supported by all the co@@ ar@@ ches or file formats . see in the help of the codi@@ les to get more information .
&quot; simply select one entry , which obviously corresponds to the style of the selected CD ; in this example , this is not important , as we do not transfer the &amp; CD ; -@@ data so why not transfer the information about the categories . Pop or R@@ ap for example are to be found under Rock . &quot;
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . click on the line with the second piece .
&quot; the window of the CD editor will be back and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we have collected for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . &quot;
click on the next line in the main window and procedure for the same way up to you all the title of the &amp; CD ;
Attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the invent@@ ory . it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and album above the piece list will be displayed .
&quot; note that there is a check @-@ sign in front of each line of a piece . only the titles are selected , or run the button All pieces choose the pieces on the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces on once . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button you started out the reading @-@ process , so this window appears to confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the record and track what runs out . &quot;
&quot; click on the tab orders to switch on the Princip@@ e . it is in the top left half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window for controlling the orders . the first piece is currently read on hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the lower part of the window in the status line .
&quot; this error messages see if you are trying to work with a co@@ oter , which you have not yet installed . plays the not successfully co@@ ded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list . &quot;
&quot; inci@@ dent@@ ally , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the target are not what we have given here in the example . have you checked whether you can write access to the folder for the temporary files and the target folder ? ; - ) &quot;
&quot; now , it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the reading of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; the contract 1 reads the first piece of it , he is finished . but we have a new entry : contract 4 is the co@@ ding of piece 1 to format MP3 . to check out read and co@@ ding parallel . note the status qu@@ eries in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has no configur@@ ations required to read this behavior , the number of parallel processes to read and co@@ ding . with powerful machines is the result of un@@ clear . the used computer with a AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem with simult@@ aneous reading and co@@ ding ( from however two different pieces ) . &quot;
&quot; now the last title refers to , while a different piece is bo@@ iled , and a third order is co@@ ded in the queue of the Ko@@ en@@ ers . after the last piece is co@@ ded , a small window with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; , you need and KDE ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create comp@@ ressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG , you need the codi@@ fication of your choice . &quot;
&amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; it is now available within the &amp; KDE ; CV@@ S as part of the dem@@ ul@@ atory package . if you are using an anonymous copy . most distri@@ butions have already been a pre @-@ compiled package . if you read the package k@@ dem@@ ul@@ atory from your distribution . if you &apos;re reading this , you probably have done it already ... &quot;
&quot; this section is directed to people , which compiled by source files , and not for users who want to use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
if you are looking for assistance such as the program can be adjusted if it once runs , then the following is right for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls many different programs , has many varieties of settings . best read the step by step up to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of different boxes of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; hello , still read on reading ? even if only the help menu was placed after the first floor of the program , without any kind of c@@ lue as it is on the time of program starts no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
&quot; what is it ? who reads , it probably has started the program . it should somehow look like this : &quot;
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author can not add this manual . it is meant to be a first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; who will always do something useful to contact with the author . and if you read it , he has to do this section and is therefore agreed with this proposal . &quot;
&quot; strange when it succe@@ eded to pick up the source file from the &amp; KDE ; SV@@ N , then you do not need this information , but ... &quot;
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ it@@ er of &amp; KDE ; . besides others it did not have some properties , the other &amp; UNIX , MIDI player . &quot;
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system to work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; KDE ; support .
&amp; k@@ mid ; indicates the lyrics on the screen with altern@@ ating color so that it is easy to follow the piece .
graphic representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by cor@@ rid@@ ors of the printed buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
Dra@@ g &amp; Drop so that you can in &amp; KDE ; any MIDI files from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window to SM@@ id .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( songs events or textiles ) . KM@@ id automatically generated the used process used .
&quot; when you finish and KDE ; during the play@@ back of a song , SM@@ id starts again with the same song again . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , A@@ we , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can select Open ... from the menu File . it appears the usual file dialog with whose help you can choose the desired song . &quot;
you can also drop a file of a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid @-@ window . this also works with multiple songs simultaneously .
&quot; to watch a piece of piece , open it and pra@@ ying the button to play in the tool@@ bar , select the entry comp@@ artment from the menu piece or pra@@ ying the spaces bar . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece automatically starts , once you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( with multiple pieces they will be added to a collection and then played suc@@ cession . ) &quot;
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece played , you can jump in any point by using the medium mouse button and drive with the regul@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows left and right of the Tem@@ po@@ display . to get the original speed , double click the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the Spac@@ eb@@ ar has two tasks : when a piece is played when a piece is played on the button , like a pressure on the button break or selecting the menu entry into the menu item , so you will play the id@@ ebook as no piece starts , starts and play@@ back . &quot;
Li@@ ed@@ tex@@ te can be saved on two types in a piece of music . some pieces use Tex@@ tures , others use Li@@ ed@@ tex@@ ter@@ able and another both . some pieces have no text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid , you can adjust which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically measured , which you need to manually set up the entry Automatic Tex@@ tures , but you still have the opportunity to change this when you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set an event of an event , select from the menu Settings menu or songs . the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you are summ@@ ari@@ zed . these will be used in this section , as you can use Coll@@ ections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you can find here in the menu collection under the point of organizing .... clicking there on New and give the name to the collection . &quot;
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking on Copy and then select the name for the new collection . this collection will include the same songs as the original .
&quot; if you have more than a collection , you can adjust the threads in the coll@@ ect@@ manager . &quot;
in the temporary collection all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
&quot; when leaving the application this collection is not stored , raise the if you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . here you can add a song using the button Add a song . it appears in turn the file dialog with whose help you want to select the desired song . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on the setting of automatic Ad@@ ding .
&quot; if automatic add to the collection is activated , a piece is added to opening ( using file opening or drag and drop ) automatically to the active collection . &quot;
&quot; when autom@@ atically add to the collection is not enabled when opening a piece , the temporary collection is activated and stored . this collection will then be added to the open pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you have to select the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click remove . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs will be played . if you select the series following the sub@@ menu of the menu collections , the songs will be played in order as they have been added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add songs or remove or random order in the menu , the order will be set . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , choose it in the collection manager , or use the drop@@ down list via the kar@@ aoke text . &quot;
&quot; to move a song you select the button &quot; &quot; Next song , the item next song from the menu piece or press the arrow right . &quot;
&quot; to jump around the reverse a song , select the button forec@@ asts , the entry forec@@ ast piece from the menu piece or push the button arrow left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , choose the collection and click the button Clear . &quot;
&quot; temporary collection can not be deleted . however , this does not play a role since it is not saved from &amp; k@@ mid ; not saved . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesizer , which are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI @-@ Events in events that under@@ stands the syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI Map that allows all events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Type Change patch to trumpet , and therefore always sound a trumpet , if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you only have a sound@@ card , you do not need MIDI @-@ Map because all Sound@@ cards are GM compatible ( including A@@ we - and G@@ us -@@ cards , FM radio devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ maps . you need to edit the appropriate file from hand ( with your favorite di@@ tor ) . &quot;
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text @-@ file which saves all necessary re@@ plac@@ ements for the play@@ back of a piece .
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section , which may appear as often as desired . prerequis@@ ite for this is that every appearance has a different texti@@ d ( see below ) . &quot;
define P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D define KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; name of the key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D define KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; ... EN@@ D define CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D
&quot; you see that define it is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D , that the end of a section is achieved . &quot;
&quot; please send me your map file as email , so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible . &quot;
in this section the patches of General MIDI is displayed on your specific keyboard . the general use looks like this :
&quot; please note that the left side of the equ@@ ity is ignor@@ ed . it is assumed that the GM will change in the right order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and also have no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to create all the notes that this instrument need to be put on the tone with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported by using ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , which allows you to use a Drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) that make the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section : &quot;
&quot; so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 ( thread ) , it takes patch 100 ( the Drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of what sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here with the term Drum patch of patch is meant to include any other per@@ cus@@ sion@@ ist instrument ( Drum , pel@@ vis , Marac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one that means the tone the sound height of the same Drum ( like him some key@@ boards ) . &quot;
&quot; KE@@ Y@@ MAP section is needed to provide , such as sounds on a particular channel or instrument . &quot;
&quot; as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section the sequence of lines is very important , as their presence . you have to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use several names in the first line .
key@@ maps are used mainly to form notes on the per@@ cus@@ sions . look at the example the supplied Key@@ maps .
&quot; this section can be used to form some channels on other ones . if you want to complete the first and second channel , make it simply in the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards that have percussion on a particular channel ( General MIDI to channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; Midi devices need 16 channels , the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , number@@ ed from 0 to 15 , built according to the following samples : &quot;
&quot; n is the channel , which is displayed on the channel N . if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map uses name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ patch option , all events will try to change the patch on this channel . in this case is always patch x used . &quot;
the option For@@ ce@@ Patch can be useful for example to always use the per@@ cus@@ sions patch on the per@@ cus@@ sions .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio will be multip@@ lied , in which relationship Pitch @-@ ben@@ der events will be converted with the value n , this will be converted with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then be passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is not used to be missing in the map file . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM will present a keyboard , that is a Pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event , with the value 40@@ 96 , a tone higher than to play . unfortunately , some key@@ boards need to play higher than a oc@@ ta@@ ve higher . to try to get the correct value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI @-@ Map , simply open the dialog MIDI settings . &quot;
the lap@@ tops is a window with a full range of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you can see which sounds exactly played .
&quot; you can also use the channel , to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a sel@@ ector list where you can choose an instrument , enlight@@ ens the button no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the K@@ anal@@ View has to display two different views to display the split sounds . view the view in the Settings menu under the point K@@ anal@@ view : settings
&quot; the pace @-@ LCD shows the speed at , with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; so you can change the pace of a song . if you find example , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow down the pace , use the arrows left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a piece of piece must be played , it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , and etc ; . thus , the same MIDI file can lead to very different results , as well as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way . &quot;
&quot; well , I cannot force any@@ body , &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while a mp3 file you need a similar sound quality . in a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc ; they have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have compiled a bin@@ ary ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; we have compiled the problem because &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ we support you need to download a source @-@ distribution and install ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos; s start@@ seite ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I have no desire to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; to accept &amp; k@@ mid ; Dra@@ g &amp; Drop . simply open the folder you want to add , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
&quot; once , activate the setting of automatic Ad@@ ding to the collection . otherwise , the files are added to the temporary collection . &quot;
you can connect the arrow key left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to restore the play@@ back . to restore the default temp@@ o to restore the default temp@@ o .
I have been working on a &amp; KDE ; -@@ Desktop with my MIDI files and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I want to play a MIDI file ) or un@@ tar@@ ft@@ et ( if I want to switch a MIDI file ) or I want to play a file , only in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and want to drag the file to the window of &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; if you just want to listen to a file , without adding them to a collection , turn off the setting of automatic Ad@@ ding to the collection , and the new one ; file will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s take you , you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . only you want to play the first file . so , set the setting of automatic install and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this a MIDI file . &quot;
then un@@ lock also B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid released and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent to me MIDI files or post@@ cards . all thank you ! if I hear these songs or watch the postcard ab@@ sent me this , further to &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ J@@ im@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ ac@@ ute ; laga . at the moment I am not much free time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a bit time for my hob@@ bies . I try to collect MIDI files to make music and pro@@ positions . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where they can download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid , or even if you just want to make me simply , write me an e @-@ mail : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .es &quot;
&quot; if you really want to send me a postcard from your home or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group , I will send me a postcard or a MIDI file , you should get in contact with me as I already have the file . &quot;
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my free time and I would like to get rid of anyone . I would like to emph@@ asi@@ ze that I only want to write feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ w@@ ai and Joseph H. B@@ üh@@ ler - Beh@@ ind the bug that was high up at A@@ we @-@ Cards .

and of course my thanks also all of these excellent musicians in the net that give us this wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
additionally to this can be found &amp; k@@ mid ; also on his homepage which can be found at http : / / www.ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .html . on the homepage you can look at the development and look at links to sites with further kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; a sound@@ card . I recommend you a good sound@@ card or an external syn@@ thesizer , as the sound quality is essential of your sound@@ card . it is not the same if you use a FM device or an A@@ we card . &quot;
&quot; if you have no sound@@ card , you have to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL , it then runs if you would like to hear a sound@@ card unless you can of course listen to music . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; KDE ; mail@@ ing lists or send an error @-@ noti@@ fy directly to me . &quot;

the application window is made of so called and@@ ock@@ able windows . there is always the window with the playlist . and finally there is a information window that is only displayed when information is displayed in it .
&quot; it is possible to make the preferred connections under the menu book@@ able , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that will be played after each other , so you should use the category thumb ! &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hier@@ apost@@ les , its group and all its sub@@ groups to the current category is copied and the reproduction begins with the click@@ ed entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and perman@@ t play@@ lists can also be modified by direct editing files . of course you can only do if &amp; k@@ mp@@ layer ; it can only be changed by the application itself . however , the different files in the directory ~ / .k@@ r / share / apps / k@@ mp@@ layer / , can only be viewed by the application itself . it is simply displayed by the application itself . by the application of a sub @-@ group , only the XML content of this part can be displayed . &quot;
&quot; after the f@@ ears of XML files , the menu has to be chosen by the playlist , and either the mach@@ ining mode selected , or any other category will be selected . &quot;
all changes have lost if the mach@@ ining mode leave or another group is selected without the playlist .
&quot; according to the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ mp@@ layer ; some functions can only be enabled by the modifications of the XML configuration files . &quot;
animation with starting and end may be disabled by ~ / .k@@ r / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c and f@@ ears from &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option does not exist , it can simply be inser@@ ted . &quot;
it is also possible to activate a different animation . &amp; k@@ mp@@ layer ; will be the files ~ / .k@@ r / share / apps / k@@ mp@@ layer / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be an supported XML file .
&quot; animation with starting hand needs not short to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by the opening of another source . this would end for the end @-@ animation however , the user can finish the application for a second time . &quot;
a simple example of an start @-@ animation can be the ads of your favorite pics . &amp; lt ; d@@ lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / ys ; &amp; lt ; / body ; &amp; lt ; / body ; &amp; lt ; / body ; &amp; lt ; / body ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; /
there is a rider to configure M@@ player in the configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ mp@@ layer ; . here the path can be adjusted from the M@@ Player and the inter@@ ference size of the dat@@ as@@ ro@@ ms from the network and other things .
another tool for trou@@ blesho@@ oting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ mp@@ layer . here is the output of mp@@ layer .
there is no rider for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ mp@@ layer ; . everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .k@@ r / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa is played :
&quot; Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ mp@@ layer ; it can even be played the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist , XML . &quot;
&quot; thus the &amp; k@@ mp@@ layer ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages can be back , the &amp; k@@ mp@@ layer ; module must be specified as an utility provider for the M@@ IME type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog file stat@@ ues of KDE . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ mp@@ layer ; is available in a con@@ soles application and browse to the store the browser module library . the st@@ art@@ ed process is called kn@@ p@@ player . if there is no mistakes , the back@@ end issue is available within &amp; k@@ mp@@ layer ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu to check ) . &quot;
&quot; thus , a pre@@ determined back@@ end for a particular M@@ IME type is taken ( of course only if this was also determined ) , this must be done by manual amend@@ ments of the file ~ / .k@@ r / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c . for example is PH@@ ON@@ ON all og@@ g files . &quot;
&amp; k@@ mp@@ layer ; can be used by TV cards either by using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be configured to use the scanner and the TV channels can be configured manually or the configuration file can be edited manually .
&quot; to configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( video data Recorder ) settings in the settings below - &gt; Qu@@ elle@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video port . there should be used ( e.g. , it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name is probably a DVB in it . &quot;
as the V@@ DR support of k@@ mp@@ layer may only use X@@ Video ( probably this kind of play@@ site does not work properly . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must therefore be functional in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) :
&quot; intern@@ ally , from KM@@ Player are used by KM@@ Player for sources different names . at the time of emergence of this documentation , this documentation is dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , both scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ cd@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are activated , begin with the play@@ lists of play@@ lists . &quot;
are there notes how I can make my CD@@ ROM drive if I switch from him ( not from VCD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command hd@@ par@@ m -@@ e 8 / dev / c@@ dro@@ m is to be able to exec@@ ute root to the input of the device . here it is absolutely secure to ensure that / dev / c@@ dro@@ m is shown on the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed for comp@@ ile by &amp; k@@ ile ; required .
&quot; latex ; : a professional x @-@ application application . under Unix @-@ like systems will probably be taken to the package &amp; tex@@ ex ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) . &quot;
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution should be included . for the installation should be the documentation of the distribution or install@@ ations CD ; / DVD should be drawn .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for various distri@@ butions and they contain simple installation without further comp@@ ile and are contained on the col@@ ile ; website .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; Latex ; , &amp; KDE ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; &quot;
&quot; advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation must be taken into account . however , the support to this project or its documentation should be requested , the contact should be produced on the col@@ ile ; website . &quot;
&quot; if you have questions concerning or by complic@@ ity of &amp; k@@ ile ; on or will extensions , this should be addressed to the mail@@ ing list k@@ ile @-@ dev@@ el @ list@@ s.@@ source@@ forge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; latex ; -@@ Sur@@ round@@ ings for the &amp; KDE ; -@@ Func@@ tions for the use of all &amp; latex ; -@@ functions in a graphical environment and within this a simple , direct and tail@@ or @-@ made access to all &amp; latex ; -@@ programs . furthermore , the possibility to complete wiz@@ ard and sound tools for these . finally , the opportunity must be called to complete wiz@@ ard , the &amp; Latex ; -@@ reference and the powerful project management . &quot;
&quot; to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and his possibilities should learn the manual to Kate , users of &amp; k@@ ile ; they can start directly with the reading of the chapter working with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; &quot;
&quot; for latex , is the right balance : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . select the present &amp; tex ; difficult to use , can also use a La@@ ie ( English . lay ) &amp; Latex ; -@@ Mak@@ ros is that it is derived from the surname of Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort . &quot;
&quot; thank you only a good location to &amp; Latex ; it is not the ultimate book to place , such as H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. Dal@@ y , A Guide to &amp; Latex ; : Document Preparation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Us@@ ers , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r . &quot;
&quot; just like other out@@ placement includes &amp; Latex ; an introduction , with which the general features are defined as paper format , si@@ deb@@ it generation and text color , with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ begin { document } . &quot;
the fast @-@ hand assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a useful function for the quick creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; . the selection of assist@@ ants ( menu ) offers some possibilities for the document related to the document .
&quot; documentary classes : with this type of document ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , book &#91; book &#93; , letter ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , Proj@@ ector &#91; Be@@ amer &#93; , slides &#91; folders &#93; or custom @-@ defined . &quot;
co@@ ding : hereby the string enco@@ ding : this is to be used the string enco@@ ding of the system . modern systems use the U@@ TF @-@ 8 enco@@ ding as standard . if necessary U@@ TF @-@ 8x should use U@@ TF @-@ 8x ( documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used packages and latex ; for inclusion they will only be selected in the cart area .
&quot; article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Articles ( DIN ) , Cover ( DIN ) , Cover ( DIN ) : the documentary classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( in compliance with German DIN @-@ regulations ) . you should always find the use of German texts in the creation of German texts . &quot;
new user is not worried either . it is only a brief description of the functions and further information will be given in the section .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers - just as other source code editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , at@@ titu@@ des and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . &quot;
with the automatic replacement of the environments for input of a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) by &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically creates a blank line ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be disabled in the menu ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) . this function can be disabled in the menu ... La@@ Te@@ X commands .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; Latex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document in the following elements ( part is the hil@@ ar@@ est and sub@@ divisions the lower element ) :
in the view of the document in the struc@@ ture@@ view the individual elements can be changed by clicking on the respective changes .
&quot; if creating your own &amp; latex , files can be very helpful as soon as a DVI ; file &#91; linear scale ) &#93; was created , jump &amp; k@@ ile ; by one click with the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ viewing on the corresponding line in the &amp; Latex ; -@@ source@@ code . &quot;
&quot; a DVI ; file contains a description of the form@@ att@@ ed document and also other information such as the font weight of &amp; tex ; or &amp; Latex ; there are many tools to view , transformation and to print DVI ; -@@ files for various systems and devices . &quot;
&quot; if you want to select the elements of DVI ; file associated with the editor , and as soon as an element in the DVI ; -@@ source text is generated , the exact opposite is generated in the &amp; Latex ; source code , the exact opposite is in DVI ; -@@ source@@ code is re@@ viewed . &quot;
Master @-@ document : this function is simpli@@ fied when working with multiple files . with a master document the work is simpli@@ fied with other integrated .@@ tex files . when using a project can be configured a project @-@ wide master Document .
&quot; quick : the &amp; Latex ; -@@ source@@ code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if no error in the source code ) . &quot;
fil@@ ing : in this mode the DVI ; file on the land@@ ing area and it is no call from &amp; Oc@@ ular to the quick@@ er .
&quot; in viewing the Bear@@ ing fields , the three large sections of the document were specially designed for the rapid integration of the document in parts , chapter , sections , ... The ver@@ sion@@ able &amp; latex ; -@@ commands for the sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; the sel@@ ector switches is more related to the items of articles such as tags , Fu@@ Ã s or refer@@ r@@ als . the possibilities are available : &quot;
&quot; name : with this command will be a name for a section , a picture or other element created . &quot;
cover : is used for the reference to a specified name ( selection ( choice ) .
&quot; if you are displayed with liter@@ ary entries . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex , this only works if the file is necessary to a project . for the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; -@@ files can also be written in &amp; ile ; from hand . &quot;
&quot; the last selection of the name is used by the name of Gr@@ Ã © es , the definition of the fonts used to be laid , etc . there are the following fonts : &quot;
at the call of &amp; k@@ ile ; are two choices for creating a new document through selection of the document and soli@@ ds of settings . 2 . the document may be written by the basis of the hand .
&quot; the brack@@ ets according to the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; lays the fonts , this may also be specified in the text . &quot;
once the above source @-@ example has been given to the &amp; Latex ; the easi@@ est way is compiled . the easi@@ est way to this is the use of men@@ ades or button .
the source @-@ text must be saved in front of the comp@@ ile . &amp; k@@ ile ; for the storage is automatically generated .
&quot; split the comp@@ ile of the document , should be sought in the log@@ ging after the faul@@ ts . if using quick construction should be started &amp; Oc@@ ular should be automatically started . if this is not the case , also the prot@@ ocol@@ s should be observed . &quot;
&quot; an area ( English . environment ) is a text that is treated different from the rest area , for example , a report with the font should have been created . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } allows you to adjust the font of the font . &quot;
the public changes are only within the environment ( of \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there are no notice ( number ) available within a environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities to enhance the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . it can be able to add particular fonts , rot@@ ating pres@@ sur@@ es , etc . these commands either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the course and is long as long until he is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word can be displayed in one sentence with \ \ emp@@ h { word } kur@@ si@@ v .
\ \ ratio : creates a quote in the document . the quote start with \ \ begin { ratio } and ends with \ \ end { ratio } .
&quot; after the background to write the source code with the &amp; latex , it is now displayed a step @-@ for @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; &quot;
&quot; once the wiz@@ ard was given a bit text , a few adjust@@ ments to get the better read@@ ability of the document . you should be mind@@ set to see a few spots in the fat and spa pres@@ sur@@ es and a po@@ em to the application to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
once the document was viewed as soon as the document can be returned to the editor ( in internal view@@ ers ) . in an external view@@ ers must be closed down its windows .
once the DVI ; file was created , the document may be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and fun . &quot;
&quot; D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; Latex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi -@@ output such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ conversion or computer @-@ par@@ ach@@ utes . &quot;
for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . in the 7th step - after clicking DVI - then the document is printed by file ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is correct ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar allows the conversion of DVI , file to other formats . once the DVI ; file from the &amp; Latex ; -@@ source text was created , the conversion can start in dic@@ t other formats using the buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
the Next attempts allows direct le@@ ap from the editor to the integrated position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; provides an appropriate setting for all &amp; Latex ; -@@ Bin@@ oc@@ ular files . there must be only modern under settings of cor@@ ile and tools .
click to be placed the cur@@ sor in a line of the source code and can be click@@ ed in a line of the source@@ code . the jump to the respective place in DVI ; -@@ viewer takes place then .
&quot; with this function in &amp; Oc@@ ular , with one click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; document the appropriate and latex ; -@@ document of &amp; k@@ ile ; ge@@ aired and to the corresponding line must be defined ( settings oc@@ ular clu@@ es ... Editor )
&quot; should not be displayed while using quick construction of the &amp; DVI ; -@@ viewing does not occur , this should be a mistake in the prot@@ ocol@@ s file or in the News@@ archive . &quot;
the prot@@ ocol@@ s file can always be used in the sources . in the editor . the prot@@ ocol@@ s file can always be used in the errors . in the editor . the prot@@ ocol@@ s file can always be seen in the errors . in order to view the faul@@ ty line . in order to see the faul@@ ty line in the prot@@ ocol@@ s and &amp; k@@ ile ; jump to the faul@@ ty line .
&quot; once you click on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window will be used to select the template for the document . &quot;
if you choose from empty document a document may either written or used for the quick creation of a new document . further information can be found in the section .
&quot; some users of &amp; Latex ; usually use the same introduction for nearly all documents . templates , stored , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either to create a existing &amp; tex ; - / Latex ; file , or create a new file created by using an existing document and selecting a file template from the document . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document made of a template by file New will replace some strings by other data ( such as name or string enco@@ ding ) . these variables can be set in settings . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know what variables will be replaced by which variables : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ S@@ SO@@ P@@ TIONS $ $ : this string will be replaced by entering into document . typically , they will be used by the input : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ S@@ SO@@ P@@ TIONS $ $ &#93; { article } . &quot;
the easi@@ est way to create a template is the use of assist@@ ants and the associated entry to the commands in the editor . once the document was created in this way the following steps were taken :
&quot; when creating a new document , your own template can be selected instead of default . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any &amp; latex ; files created , a simple way to create a template should be sought after one on the Internet and the steps described below . &quot;
&amp; quot ; uses &amp; k@@ ate ; as internal editor . &amp; k@@ ate ; is a Text@@ editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and herr@@ ing of many different types of text files ( including also &amp; Latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings may be made directly from &amp; k@@ ile ;
&quot; to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and its possibilities should experience the manual to Kate , users of &amp; k@@ ile ; they can start there directly with the reading of the chapter working with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; latex ; command instruction refer@@ enz , which can be called for the help of La@@ Te@@ X reference . you will find a detailed description nearly all commands that can be found in &amp; Latex ; use and their syntax . &quot;
&quot; double @-@ click with penet@@ rating Ctr@@ l button to select the &amp; tex ; meaning that in this way clicking \ \ par \ \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p \ \ \ par \ \ \ par \ \ \ par \ \ \ par \ \ \ par \ \ \ par \ \ \ par \ \ \ par \ \ \ par \ \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while drag@@ ging the text , the balanced text will be automatically copied to the clip@@ board . &quot;
the parts of the arrow keys can be selected or balanced in the editing pane in the editor .
&amp; k@@ ile ; has to search the most varied types of source @-@ tex@@ ts and these her@@ nia . for example , the &amp; Latex ; commands of the normal text and also the mathemati@@ cal form@@ ul@@ as are high@@ lighted by another color . &quot;
&quot; many assist@@ ants can be added . it is a own type of book@@ marks inside the text . it is also high@@ lighted the jump to the nights@@ &apos; or the appropriate key@@ boards , so that it is automatically high@@ lighted by the first input of a drawing automatically . &quot;
&quot; the Edit is probably one of the main aspects of using a program like &amp; k@@ ile ; . although &amp; k@@ ate ; already excellent possibilities , in &amp; ag@@ ile ; important functions for writing a &amp; latex ; -@@ source ; special commands may include : &quot;
&quot; select a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing on both sides a blank line ) . these advanced importance include tables , &amp; Latex ; -@@ Comman@@ ds and all other lines of the source code . the only pre@@ ventive thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; is that the bott@@ oms are separated by two empty lines . &quot;
&quot; choose the word under the current currency position . this selection also has an extended meaning , since this command also has a latex she@@ eting command ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end . &quot;
&quot; to the length of a part of the document , it can be removed from the first part of the document . &amp; k@@ ate ; K with which the entire line will be removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the following commands as to the length of the text : &quot;
remove a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is contained in the description to edit paragraph .
it has already been realized that environments a central role in &amp; Latex ; therefore offers &amp; k@@ ile ; for further orders under Bear@@ ing environment for a reduced simple work with &amp; Latex ;
&quot; with this command , to take part in the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to its surroundings . &quot;
with this command will take part in the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to close the surroundings .
&quot; if the cur@@ sor before or within the command \ \ begin { setting } is , will lead to the end of the environment ( or vice ver@@ sa ) . &quot;
&quot; if you enter a lot of cont@@ amin@@ ated ambi@@ ent command can be lost quickly , the most recently renovated environment , so that the sc@@ atter@@ ed ambi@@ ent structure is not cru@@ m@@ ble . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; Latex ; -@@ groups who are determined by brack@@ ets { ... } . under Bear@@ ing Te@@ X group are a few important commands that correspond to the surrounding area .
the cur@@ sor is placed right at the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the turn@@ table plum@@ bers .
with this command will lead to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the finish cl@@ amp .
&quot; if the cur@@ sor before or behind the wel@@ ded cl@@ amp of a &amp; tex ; Group # is , will lead to the other end of the group ( or vice ver@@ sa ) . &quot;
&quot; when you enter many cont@@ amin@@ ated groups par@@ enth@@ eses can be lost quickly the above @-@ view , so that the we@@ alth@@ y structure of the &amp; tex ; -@@ groups did not dis@@ integrate . &quot;
in &amp; Latex ; they are used for two simple connections . for the purpose of execution is used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign &quot; is used . &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and apply two close @-@ up attachment .
this automatic ir@@ respective of the double marks can be set among at@@ titu@@ des ... La@@ Te@@ X set up and off .
it can also be used as well @-@ known settings ( such as nger@@ man or french ) and thus German or fran@@ tic begin@@ nings . there are also many other languages available .
&quot; if you see the current position within a lists -@@ surroundings ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ emi@@ ze ) , for example the current position within a lists of environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ emi@@ ze ) , but at the same time the command \ \ item . &quot;
inside a tables environment close together with \ \ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an in@@ coming break .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to under@@ take pres@@ et &amp; latex ; - or custom @-@ defined environments to under@@ lines ... La@@ Te@@ X to add ... La@@ Te@@ X .
&quot; some users want to arrange the columns in tables , and thereby all E@@ t @-@ signs ( amp ; ) among each other . &amp; k@@ ile ; tries to obtain it ; for the useful tab@@ ulator in the present table , for the useful table for the columns of the current tab@@ ulator . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; k@@ ate ; has already been a good source code , this in &amp; k@@ ile ; for special commands ( usually available &amp; Latex ; ) , these modes can be set to different work methods . all of these modes can be set to settings . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning a new environment using the command \ \ begin { surroundings } , &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ end { Sur@@ round@@ ings } after an empty line ( for the text ) . &quot;
&quot; when the return , the last letter will be removed and allows for the complete list of input . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by entering a further letters . &quot;
&quot; all commands will be written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , descriptions are collected by &amp; k@@ ile ; also jumping stamps , so that a simple jump to these positions can be reduced by editing stamps &quot;
&quot; among at@@ titu@@ des , ag@@ ile , appropriate settings to these lists can be made . it can be made possible to make different wind@@ ing list &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ commands as well as betting levels of general language . &quot;
the command mode is for the complete list of environments not useful . it allows you to have entered a large number of letters with \ \ begin and the call of the amplifier module will be used so often that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for the understanding of the environments .
&quot; if the command of the amplifier mode , the menu , the menu is automatically st@@ epp@@ ed and it appears \ \ begin { . afterwards , the ambi@@ ent can be continued and will be completed by clicking the input button . &quot;
&quot; after this is accompl@@ ished , the environment will be automatically closed again . once &amp; k@@ ile ; recognize that it is a list of creating a lists , is even a first \ \ item command . &quot;
among at@@ titu@@ des ; set ... k@@ ile ; Compar@@ ed settings to these lists are made . this mode uses the wo@@ und@@ ed list of the comp@@ ass@@ ment mode : - and &amp; Latex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; quot ; emphas@@ iz@@ es custom lists of di@@ versi@@ es which will immediately be replaced by portable strings . the lists can be set among at@@ titu@@ des etc . the lists can be inser@@ ted in the settings of K@@ ile . the lists can be found in the example of L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
&quot; for example , the letter L is entered and the word consu@@ mer@@ ged re@@ tention , the letter is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X will be replaced . &quot;
&quot; gross neg@@ atives are not helpful . however , that many wo@@ und@@ ed in a document has been written more than once . thus , offers &amp; k@@ ile ; the delay of all already written wo@@ und@@ ed . &quot;
this mode can be set in the menu ... K@@ ile comp@@ artment . here you can also apply the sw@@ elling for the indication of the amplifier .
the comp@@ artment files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .k@@ r / share / apps / k@@ ile / complete / mode / the Individual Home folder . mode is available for t@@ elling ( refres@@ h@@ ation ) or tex .
the dialog graphics can be designed as easy as possible . to view the basics of graphics formats should be observed and observed .
&quot; PS files are not as known as PDF files , but also offer an excellent basis for the current and new regulations of pages . &quot;
&quot; to view the result of the work , must be comp@@ ile the source code . all buildings are group@@ ed in the menu , creating converting , converting and create view . &quot;
for the comp@@ ile of the source viewer like &amp; Oc@@ ular ; or the further transformation can be used to be the keyboard using Alt ; 3 , using Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file into a PS file , and by Alt ; 5 the PS file can be viewed . &quot;
&quot; if using the command quick construction is normally called a viewer after the comp@@ ile . should not be used as a built @-@ in viewer , so once a new window will become a new window . &quot;
a new project will be about the project &apos;s project in the project .... here the following information for the project will be asked :
&quot; while running the filename , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file . &quot;
the script function of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows the instruc@@ tor of the EC@@ MA@@ Script Code . the scripts can be managed in the ver@@ tically talented prot@@ est .
the API script are not developed and can be found in further versions of &amp; k@@ ile ; even more .
&quot; first , it must be said that the expansion of the script in &amp; k@@ ile ; a systematic object ( = k@@ ile ) has the following methods : &quot;
&quot; &amp; Latex ; is a quite clever system , where the basic functions will be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a lot of different help to support the user . &quot;
tet@@ set@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are included with many documents . included are a documentation for the packages and a further &amp; latex ; reference .
&quot; this is a full description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described , but rather a few important packages are described ( but a few important packages are described here ) but rather it is ideal for a very large number of data , it is divided into &amp; k@@ ile ; divided into three important book@@ marks . &quot;

&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; they may have little to do with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; self , you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not need to wait until someone that is used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements . &quot;
&quot; to install a plugin or part , we begin with the menu plugins . &quot;
this dialog allows to manage all the plugins to manage and add new ones . we describe any &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search trail . in addition of plugins without a storage place used &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often working on a project several people in a type of hier@@ arch@@ ical relationship with each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with shift ; F@@ 7 project project @-@ properties .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nickname is the nickname of the user and is used for unique identification .
a member may have several roles in the project as well as sub@@ project leader .
the user can look for even from the list of te@@ amm@@ ers who he is . this happens when he expres@@ ses the team member from the list and the button S@@ etze . currently selected a member ( their identification ) will be set up after you are : text .
nickname and setting of their own identity is important as regards to news and notes . see for further information on notes .
&quot; besides an overview of her team , there is another advantage through the collection of members of the team : it can be an event for information to the team@@ leader , if something is defined . see in for further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are executed when somewhat defined in the project . one example would be viewed as much a message , or the sending of a message when a file is secured , or a script that a file is added to the CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the side of event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project proj@@ ection dialog can be edited , edited and deleted . &quot;
an e @-@ mail is sent to the reci@@ pi@@ ent list of selected ad@@ ress@@ as . the Ad@@ ress@@ at can be a team or sub@@ project leader . see in which such lad@@ der will be set up .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments using the following things :
remarks is simple . it can be selected either the note item out of the editor @-@ context menu or the @ annotation keyword in a commentary box followed by remarks text .
&quot; remarks can be sent to a certain member of the team . in this case the syntax of the team members , the project leader in the following possibilities : team leader in the sub@@ project and sub@@ project lad@@ ders should be specified in the following examples of sub@@ project , as in the following examples . &quot;
&quot; nickname and roll names are independent of big or small @-@ ups , but space around the cl@@ as@@ ps and the : make the note invali@@ d . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for scripts and form@@ ations that supports D@@ TD @-@ agnos@@ tically and web @-@ based form@@ ati@@ - and script@@ ing languages .
the settings are available via the Settings menu . here are only available via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings treated - a short description for the other can be found in .
the settings can be set by means of settings Qu@@ anta . this dialog extends to several pages that can be treated after each other .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags including car @-@ completion can be modified . the entries are :
&quot; large / min@@ de@@ preci@@ ation of tags : large / min@@ de@@ preci@@ ation of tags : large / min@@ de@@ ed tags , the tags are so inser@@ ted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / to@@ en@@ rol@@ ment of attri@@ butes : large / small letters of attri@@ butes , the attri@@ butes means the attri@@ butes , the attri@@ butes are so inser@@ ted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags : if raised , is available for tags , for which the final day is optional , this is immediately after &amp; gt ; inser@@ ted . &quot;
not optional tags : as above for all other tags with exception of the simple tags .
&quot; starting and closing @-@ day automatically refres@@ h : if swit@@ ched , the corresponding day will be changed and vice ver@@ sa . &quot;
automatic detection of ac@@ cent signs : controls the automatic transformation of ac@@ cent@@ ered signs into the appropriate key@@ ing during the one .

default enco@@ ding : the co@@ ding of new created or in other ways than with file opening times ( where the co@@ ding of the file can be passed away ) . this setting here will be loaded from the same into the project properties , if a project is charged . &quot;
&quot; Standard @-@ D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for new files , or for files whose D@@ TD is not det@@ ected . this setting here is powered by the same in the project properties , if a project is charged . &quot;
&quot; create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; creates a backup copy , so that with a black@@ out or cr@@ ash in the next start of the program the document may be restored from this sec@@ uring . it is not the same as stor@@ ing the file . even for a non @-@ stored documents will be created regularly , according to the finished time . &quot;
the preview and documentation can either be displayed in the edi@@ torial area or an own view ( or the documentation in a box ) that makes it possible to look for the documentation and the source text simultaneously .
Set the shut@@ down to the standard back at the next start is useful when the user interface is done by changing the M@@ DI modes and end@@ o@@ cks / depend on bel@@ iefs . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the War@@ n@@ Force range serves the taxes of the possibility to fix the display of war@@ nings by an@@ h@@ ooks .
&quot; the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL , to change . it can be defined the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ isation behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source @-@ text view on the different modes . &quot;
&quot; here , the par@@ ser and struc@@ ted tree , which represents the figure of the Par@@ ser @-@ node in the document , can be adjusted in details . &quot;
in the range of mouse click on the structure @-@ tree shows the following action it is possible to change due to the struc@@ turing structure with the mouse au@@ xili@@ ary action .
&quot; in the area of structural settings , the visibility of k@@ not can be opened in the tree , the actu@@ alization frequency of the tree during editing , and how deep in a change in the structural change will be automatically opened . empty kn@@ ots are the empty areas in the text , while blank groups are not found in which the actual document was no element found . &quot;
&quot; the range for fix@@ ing abbrevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) , which may be valid in groups , each one can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s , it can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s , it can be a valid group for PHP , in which the if@@ cl@@ ause short@@ cut something else means than in a group valid for Javascript . &quot;
&quot; here , the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plugins are K@@ Part applications from the third , which can be used by any K@@ Part @-@ capable application , at the most famous &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . &quot;
address : the path to plugin if it is not located on a standard location like $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / lib .
&quot; input : this information will pass the plugin for the start , so it can open the current file to the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project . &quot;
&quot; check in &quot; &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; mode : check whether the plugin is den@@ ied the shop . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually den@@ ied this option if this option is not chosen . &quot;
&quot; check the plugin : is this enabled , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; whether the specified information is correct . then the memory of the entry is not available , but it is scheduled to be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; starting from version 3.3 , the error attempts was completely new . as well as support for the db@@ g Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead of this became a deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin &apos;s concept , which allows various implem@@ entations through plugins . &quot;
&quot; currently , only one plugin available , the support for use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; included . &quot;
the use of the deb@@ ug@@ ger for a project begins with selecting a suitable deb@@ ug@@ ger plugins in the project settings . with the button options next to the deb@@ ug@@ ger @-@ plugin outputs can be changed to the specific settings .
&quot; if for a project being a deb@@ ug@@ ger , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ user interface : &quot;
a view that is displayed in the contents of the ignor@@ ed variables . appears normally in the left Dock .
&quot; a view , in which all stops , with Z@@ eil@@ enn@@ u@@ numbers and conditions are listed . usually , usually in the lower Dock . &quot;
a view which is shown in the output ( as in HTML ) of the deb@@ ug@@ ger . usually appears in the lower Dock .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of deb@@ ug@@ gers , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; with this action the connection to Deb@@ ug@@ ger is required , if required , or it shares the plugin with , on deb@@ u@@ gan@@ acts . this promotion will be opened by default , so that a deb@@ ug@@ ger does not need to be respected in the fall . &quot;
the counter@@ part to deb@@ ug@@ gen session starts the session . includes the connection to the deb@@ ug@@ ger or termin@@ ates the pur@@ suit of requirements .
send a HTTP request to the server to view a deb@@ ug requirement . this is equal with the use of a browser to look to the current document . the issue of this requirement is displayed in the view of Deb@@ ug@@ ger .
&quot; the deb@@ ug@@ ger start to begin with the execution of the script and to date information about the super@@ vised variables , as well as the currently carried out line , the execution will be continued during the script will start the script using the request . &quot;
&quot; pro@@ ves the deb@@ ug@@ ger to begin with the execution of the script , without information on sur@@ veillance variables and the current Z@@ eil@@ enn@@ u@@ mmer , the execution runs on , the execution starts , starts the execution as soon as a requirement is provided . &quot;
the deb@@ ug@@ ger leads the next statement in the script without entering the functions or includes .
the deb@@ ug@@ ger leads the next statement in the script and if possible in functions and includes .
&quot; indicates the deb@@ ug@@ ger to leave the statement and go to the next one , as if there would be the current . &quot;

documentary Edi@@ ted Edi@@ ted Package ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to provide support for mark@@ ers and scripts as well as &amp; CSS ; they allow &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; skills like car rental and bo@@ ads ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web@@ developer , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; s &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script and &amp; CSS ; . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two parts , the tag files and the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . see in for details of conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ rc ; and also tool@@ bars . short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attri@@ butes of tags , as well as the layout and content of the Fe@@ atur@@ es@@ di@@ alog@@ ical , for the day . the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ rc ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; self . tool@@ bar enable quick inser@@ tion of tags in a document without risk of a writing . &quot;
&quot; tag @-@ Folder are nothing but folder . they contain only the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ rc ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag files carry the name of the trouble @-@ language and version , so there . ( for example , html @-@ 4@@ .01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML on and de@@ clin@@ ed whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as you can have better insight and more information in working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes every element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits will be presented in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only be included in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains as only one element type above itself nothing else . &quot;
the type of tags is a script function . when using it &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only for the apartment type class is valid . the name of the basic class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only for the type of method is valid . gives the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common attribute group and the attri@@ butes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ day . this is an element type element .
describes an attribute of a tags . this element can only be used once for any attribute . additionally it includes the name and type of the attribute . additionally it contains more tags that shall describe as this attribute is to be used &amp; etc ; this is an element element type element .
gives the source used source code for the attri@@ butes in the tag @-@ editing dialog and the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used for reaching the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p meth@@ odology within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; will be used to achieve the data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a cutting and a meth@@ od@@ enn@@ amen . the arguments given to the method will be passed . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , this means the name of the current tags . &quot;
a container day that group@@ ed the elements of a list together . it can only be used for an attribute description . it is an important element .
lies the position of the attri@@ but@@ tes of a tags within a dialogue . this day may occur only once for each attribute ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
gives the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present in dialogue once ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this element is empty .
displays a list of elements that may happen within the defin@@ ing tags . this element is an element type .
returns a list of elements that one day finish . this element is an element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; fix : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 enco@@ ding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly saved and closed .
&quot; space affect nothing but pay attention to &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced with &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; , especially in elements like &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; be replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
to check the Tag@@ XML files the tools dialog at the top &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Windows to start and re@@ viewing Tag@@ X@@ M@@ L. . another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions .
this function is currently not available . currently the review is conducted only at charging the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
in the following example for a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; narrow &gt; element of the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ sch@@ ema . the filename for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ atic .
in the following example for a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file is a &amp; PHP ; over@@ la@@ de function described . the filename in this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .

&quot; the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ rc ; file is also quite simple and there is an editor for it , achiev@@ able D@@ TD settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ crip@@ tion@@ rc ; for one new &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ rc ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ rc ; the following entries will be created : &quot;
&#91; general &#93; version = use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for every higher version . name = D@@ TD HTML 4@@ .01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Nickname = The simpli@@ fied name of D@@ TD . ( html 4@@ .01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as Nickname &quot;
an action can set up with settings actions ... created . click New action leads to the same dialog :
this action is assigned to the keyboard short@@ cut . with an click the button to be assigned to a keyboard short@@ cut ; with K@@ einer is the current keyboard short@@ cut .
the easi@@ est actions . it can be inser@@ ted into the detailed settings and in execution of the action this text in the document is inser@@ ted in the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful action sty@@ p . with the help of this action you can use external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that may change the document or as input ( or parts of the document ) . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and interpre@@ ters are specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; although qualified paths allows , it is recommended to use the % script@@ able variable in the command line : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / script local script@@ ed@@ ders : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / script / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line : &quot;
% f : we replace the URL of the current document . in case of a local document is file : / from the document name .
p@@ id : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance runs , the text will be used to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; by the external script . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the filename or path to the project @-@ file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the above mentioned methods may take a script input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; at the default entry . in the option@@ ally input , what is to send to the default value . possibilities are : &quot;
&quot; selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input is usually useful only with this setting . &quot;
&quot; according to the input , the output of the elabor@@ ated application can be re@@ directed . there are two types output : normal output , added to the default issue , which is to be specified on the default issue , sending the value the output current issue : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create for each group an own tool@@ bar . in given case it is not too many , therefore one can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the market . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add actions and configure . select settings actions . &quot;
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New action button at the lower end of the window starts the Edit mode .
fill in all the required fields and add the day to the suitable tool@@ bar .
&quot; complete everything and , if the tag attri@@ butes , and you can planning their use , activate the dialog &quot; tag , &quot; if available , for an entry in turn to the action is possible . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? we replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; k@@ icon@@ edit ; type For other programs ( or where else it is located in its distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; used by default 3@@ 2x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , choose edit size . &quot;
&quot; please note that the protected symbol does not only help you to remember what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the day start , says , I decided to create a grid as a symbol . using the use of green ( green is usually interpre@@ ted as a name , ads , further interpre@@ ted , or should at least , a message to the user is sign@@ aled that assu@@ mes this symbol is to insert . &quot;
after the creation of a symbol it must still be connected to the action . this happens over the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selection of the desired action . next to the text field is a button push it .
&quot; select the folder in which the stored icon is , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the user button and continue using other tags , so it is what there is , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
supp@@ ose you want to complement some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; functions for the tool@@ bar supplement or it should be able to set the tool@@ bars in several groups . create the tool@@ bars in several groups . create the tool@@ bars selected by settings tools .
&quot; I would like to choose the tr@@ act ( quite left above ) for my tool@@ bar , which is to be added to tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
I would like to have a fast option to access the Con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will choose it and add the tool@@ bar .
&quot; please note how the den@@ omin@@ ator support the group@@ ing . someone who knows my tool@@ bar , could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button the opposite of the start @-@ race . &quot;
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by chec@@ king all symbols to ensure that everything works .
&quot; back in the right folder . after re@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be stored in the right folder . please match her &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ rc ; so that its tool@@ bar ( s ) should be loaded in the right folder ( s ) , when a file is opened from the appropriate type . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the mentioned expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the opportunity to add documentation to the script@@ ing language or the form@@ ati@@ zing language , which you like to love . therefore describes this chapter , as I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation work for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory , whether someone has already done for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to create an existing documentation for the form@@ ati@@ zing / script / etc ; language . then you have to leave the doc@@ rc file . the first part we leave you to the second one we treat here . &quot;
&quot; # KDE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = Carl@@ son , relative to this file , e.g. php@@ 42 / # elements in the main index top element = your description for these documents for example &amp; PHP ; 4.2 documentation Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ ist Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ of@@ 1 =
the section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentary tree . for example you can see now in PHP &amp; PHP ; documentation like something :
# KDE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = php@@ 42 / # top level element Top Element = PHP 4.2
notice the # before G@@ etting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . it shows that it is about sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known border for the chess feder@@ ation ( except by reason ) , but try it yourself . &quot;
you notice that the subscription is directly displayed directly to a file ( and consistent at the top end of the construction size &amp; md@@ ash ; folder will be displayed ! ) .
space affect nothing but pay attention to &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; resol@@ utions
&quot; the contents of the doc@@ rc file , which is to be displayed in the file of the doc@@ rc file , for example when writing a &amp; PHP ; script the documentation for the mys@@ ql _ fetch _ array function , the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ list ) and the file @-@ binding lines . &quot;
&quot; a simple list of separated context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot;
now you can save your file doc@@ rc and may be saved to $ HO@@ ME / .k@@ r / apps / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as if you do this in your file doc@@ rc ) in the same folder as doc@@ rc and copy your HTML documentation there .
&quot; if you are sure that these well and it is worth to be shared , send your doc@@ rc files with a description of important information , e.g. what documentation have been used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Community . you will not be rich , but proud to have been working with the best webdesign . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to divi@@ de resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bar with promotions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or else to whom . at different places there is sending an email to send mail packages , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with e @-@ mail tool , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the script tree . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be upload in our main archive , from where all others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; users can be downloaded and only available when our team will be considered correctly and useful for publication . thus , the origin of resources are guaranteed , both for our team and for later users . &quot;
&quot; while up@@ loading you are asked about their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase to their private G@@ PG key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase will not be saved ) , or in the case that you have multiple keys , you can choose a look . in the dialogue New resource can be empty ( URL _ preview may be empty ) and click OK . &quot;
upload the up@@ loading of the menus D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) to upload tool@@ bars and folders in the Templates and script in the Templates and script .
&quot; after downloading a resource , nor before installation , studied &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the invali@@ d of the resource by consideration of integrity and signature . in case of problems , it can be broken . in case of problems and it can then be broken . in case of integrity and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the specification of the prototype of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work on XML @-@ languages , which is currently not yet supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it is currently possible to work by using a D@@ TE@@ P package . there is the easi@@ est way to convert a D@@ TD automatically into a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
the conversion can be started by the D@@ TD shop and converting a D@@ TD . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD description that will be used for the following dialogue :
target name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written to this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE Defin@@ i@@ tions@@ line : the string that should appear in ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C / / D@@ TD HTML 4@@ .01 Transi@@ tional / / EN http : / / www.w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ ml@@ 4 / lo@@ ose@@ .d@@ t@@ d &quot;
&quot; fine setting of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion , if activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after conversion the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ rc ; Editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there are some key concepts . in order to understand this and full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us . this chapter tries to create precisely these concepts without understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; little benefits br@@ ushing . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the work@@ space divided into three areas : global , local and project related . this distinction also affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &quot;
&quot; global elements are for each , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; uses , available . from tool@@ bars , which is marked as globally , in the joint order structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this allows the group of the administ@@ rators in the common folder structure from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us . this allows the group of the administ@@ rators to secure actions and patterns in the global tree , which can then be available in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web developers for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tools . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be done all of &amp; CSS ; -@@ designs up to tool@@ bar with special actions especially for the files of a particular project . simply said this is the most restricted size . all elements are adapted in the folder of the project , which is the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the design , the cartridge containing information and the tool@@ bar . please pro@@ pose in , and for further information about these areas . &quot;
&quot; one can click the kart@@ ing with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document@@ aries , such as close to the current , other or all box , jump to a book@@ marks or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right click on a further context menu regarding the processed document content , such as the basic processing steps ( except / paste ) , processing of the file under the cur@@ sor or open the file , if the string was called under the cur@@ sor file . &quot;
&quot; at the top of the editors you will find the tool@@ bars of the Edi@@ tors . currently , &amp; HTML ; 4@@ .01 transi@@ tional as standard for which a set of tool@@ bar is shown . in the course of the further outlet of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the tool@@ bar will be adapted to the new functions and associated with user needs . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool@@ bar is really easy . if you want to insert a simple day , e.g. , then click the icon that the day is represented , then you can insert the data for this straight day . you should insert the data for this straight day ( like an@@ chor ) , you can fill in a dialogue different fields . &quot;
&quot; the libraries ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow it to navig@@ ate in the information &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to navig@@ ate it and to see . in the presentation with boxes , document , scripts , script , attri@@ butes , attri@@ butes , attri@@ butes , attri@@ butes , attri@@ butes , attri@@ butes , scripts and documentation work . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us . this view shows all files in the project and allows the managing files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as add , un@@ loading or delete the files from the memory medium can be carried out using the displayed context menu . &quot;
&quot; another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; There are all options open . &quot;
templates can be divided into three categories depending on which connection they are used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ work@@ space . global templates are always available , local templates only for the corresponding users and templates in projects are available only in the project . &quot;
&quot; here you will find information on the available script@@ ing languages . the concept of integration process in Global , Local and project also works here . through clicking on the right mouse button you can start the available information on a script , e.g. the right mouse button are available to edit or send the script . &quot;
with this view one shows the internal structure of the active document . by links @-@ Click the cur@@ sor in the document is set to the position of the el@@ ementary pro@@ position . by right click on navigation and refres@@ her of the tree .
this tree appears under the other buildings . with it can change man@@ quickly attri@@ butes and nam@@ ing rooms . it allows the modification of all available attri@@ butes with few clicks .
&quot; here is the complete documentation about the web @-@ technology for your development . it may be downloaded for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; Documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder as a project can be selected , edited and viewed by adding a project @-@ specific documentation . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two boxes will be reached at the lower end of the window , which can be reached using the News@@ detail and the problem windows . &quot;
this Kart@@ ell shows information about each in Qu@@ anta current script . such as the D@@ TD of current document and all changes to D@@ TD .
&quot; this map shows all the mistakes in the Mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; scripts , which will be executed in this window . &quot;
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a icon and they get the corresponding command . the Cho@@ col@@ ates of the tool@@ bar is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; sends the tool@@ bar as a comp@@ ressed T@@ ar archive over &amp; K@@ mail ; if they are able to secure it in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; like any other secure and load !
&quot; it is reasonable , if you want to adapt the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ files to your system can be given to the configure script . in order to get a complete list of options that can be transferred to the configure script . the options are easy to understand and do not run . &quot;
&quot; if you have problems with starting from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you should check whether your path contains the &amp; KDE ; 3 bin folder also . also you should make sure that there is no older version of &amp; KDE ; 3 in the P@@ AT@@ H in front of their bin folder . same applies to &amp; Q@@ t . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the KDE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optimized for a quick Web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; during the effort , the best &amp; HTML ; Editor to create , began the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a stand@@ alone , expand@@ able mark@@ up @-@ editor would be ? well , this would be done for absolutely great Web @-@ development tool for &amp; KDE . so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; is limited &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . &quot;
&quot; now to be held to the above claim has to be held , that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of all the whole &amp; KDE ; develop@@ ment@@ ed . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; follow , in good use of free software , the idea of why you have been developed , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; so to expand how they need it for their need . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; allows web developers to increase dram@@ atic and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase productivity dram@@ atically . by the program command of the command they can be &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; do not have to expand any scripts . ( more about it can be found in . )
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web @-@ development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and has been developed quickly to an elabor@@ ated editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way linked to commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; connected . the original developers left the GPL @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more in the detail of the documentation is with help : / qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ help@@ center help : / qu@@ anta perform ) . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ anta ; is currently developed and looked after by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon sequ@@ it@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a speed@@ ometer list of files that you have opened . this list is changed every time , if you open a file that is not listed here , whereby the oldest entry is taken . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for later use . look at the section about templates . should they try to store the selected file / text outside the local / project . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ ts from the clip@@ board there , special characters to &amp; HTML ; description , so that it is shown correctly and not understood by the browser as a form@@ ati@@ zing statement . &quot;
convert the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; description which the correct way to inser@@ ting special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s is primarily used to inser@@ ts &amp; URL ; s into the an@@ chor day .
swit@@ ched the block@@ selection of or off . this allows you to choose text blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift ; taste .
jump to a group number . this is very helpful when you &amp; PHP ; -@@ script kno@@ bs !
sear@@ ches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed phr@@ ases in order to help you .
displays the News@@ feed on or not to . this is the window where you can see the display of scripts and deb@@ ug@@ ger .
&quot; - and power of the problem , at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window of the problem will be activated , as soon as you change to the structural change . &quot;
displays the tool@@ bar left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; when it comes to the current file , they will appear in the menu with the entries &quot; &quot; Next or &quot; &quot; depending on the position of the cur@@ sor in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other chess documents appear in the menu group@@ ed after the filename of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ projects will be saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to specify files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the repository .
sear@@ ches the project @-@ directory according to new files that might be there . this allows for example graphics files into your project folders or sub@@ folders and then add it to the project .
loads the files in your project on the server high . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; KDE ; starting and whether you have downloaded further deposits .
settings like &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project managed . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ projects you will find the details explained .
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are preserved in project you / Tool@@ bar and are only shown in this menu if you assigned it to this project .
saving a dialog to store your tools . allows you to select type of tool@@ bar : locally or project .
&quot; opens up a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . that only creates the name . actions must be saved through settings actions , and you will be asked , if you want to save the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; remo@@ ving a tool@@ bar from the view . that does not delete it from the hard@@ disk . if you have not saved the tool@@ bar , you will be asked if you want to do this . &quot;
&quot; with this , you can send their own tool@@ bar ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Team , so that the tool@@ bar is available in the next release ) . the menu option opens a new E@@ Mail message with the tool@@ bar as an attachment . &quot;
&quot; enables the up@@ loading of tool@@ bars on the main server , where any other can access it . see in . &quot;
Download a &amp; D@@ TD ; that you or anyone has made someone else and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own con@@ stip@@ ation format .
&quot; load / stri@@ ving the enti@@ ties from the &amp; D@@ TD ; it is useful when the enti@@ ties come from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; to ren@@ ew , without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; to ren@@ ew . if this globally is and a writing in the global KDE files is not available , fa@@ ils the shop . &quot;
&quot; this menu features a list of tags , which is available in the currently selected items , is available in the tags menu a sub@@ menu standard , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current day @-@ Settings dialog , if there is one . this entry is always available , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus . &quot;
activ@@ ates or de@@ activate the intelligent paste from tags . currently this means only with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent paste means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the inser@@ ting using tool@@ bar , if this day does not dis@@ agree to this place the rules . &quot;
in the plug @-@ ins menu the available plugins are listed below the menu . click here . click enabled to view it . click on a activated plug @-@ in menu .
select the syn@@ opsis mode for the current file . the list of available articles depends on the k@@ ate ; -@@ version .
&quot; select the type of tick @-@ identification . very useful when you know the other OS platforms for developers . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
checks the syntax of the current document based on the selected &amp; D@@ TD ; by means of external application tidy .
&quot; immediate converting between the different types of user interface . by some limitations in KDE libraries , the swit@@ ching sometimes need time need or un@@ nice graphics . recommended , the cart@@ ography is , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu item for each open sub @-@ window will enable an entry . with selection of a contract , the appropriate sub@@ window will be activated . &quot;
divi@@ des the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; major windows .
&quot; the changes in this dialog are influenced any application , using the K@@ HTML @-@ Part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Web@@ browsers . &quot;
depends the behavior of the Edi@@ tor@@ ator . in the documentation of &amp; k@@ ate ; you will find details .
a dialog will appear in which you can delete entries from the tool@@ bar or what to add and the sequ@@ ences .
&quot; this should generate a help in accordance with the environment of the mouse , but is not yet implemented . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that freely available and freely licensed , but like with any open source project , the developers can always support help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ development in financial form , they find here the way . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed at the top of the top of the project , as after the filling of the project , the whole directory structure will automatically be completed for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information can be completed later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project features . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project , for example foo . when entering name is automatically filled out . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; project @-@ file . by default it has the name of the project into small letters and without space with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can access the server @-@ address of the machine to which one wants to access local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ ug@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 127@@ .0@@ .0.@@ 1 ) are possible .
&quot; if one can be empty this field , the default settings of the chosen prot@@ ocol@@ s . depending on the setting of the remote host may be an adaptation necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder to be saved in which the templates for the project is stored . it is a relative path to project and by default . if a common collection of files used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder to be saved in which the tool@@ bar is stored for the project . it is a relative path to project and default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; that allows , files from the local file system to add files to the project . you can select multiple files or whole folder . &quot;
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . at ser@@ vers@@ y script ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) one has to move different . &quot;
&quot; temp@@ ted when files that are somewhere in the main folder of the project , should be integrated somewhere in the main folder of the project . if a project is started to new , not An@@ h@@ aken . &quot;
this option will display all files and folders within the main folder and you can make an accurate selection of g@@ low .
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by An@@ h@@ ooks , or by remo@@ ving the heads , cl@@ ing out of the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project assist@@ ants includes three settings that make your work simpli@@ fy . these settings can be upload in the menu with project project properties in the menu option or with the keyboard short@@ cut Shift ; F@@ 7 changed .
some settings correspond to those in the project assist@@ ants and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of filename ( wild@@ card possible ) that will be re@@ structured in project @-@ related operations such as the project @-@ folder .
&quot; additional options to top , also files that are listed in .c@@ v@@ sign@@ or are excluded from the project . &quot;
the project view that is charged at the opening of the project . it can be read more about project goals .
&quot; with this , the desired deb@@ ug@@ ger can be selected . currently , the deb@@ ug@@ ger @-@ Plugin can be set in . the deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin can be set with the button options . in the deb@@ ug@@ ger options can be described . &quot;
&quot; in the under@@ window profiles you can upload Hoch@@ la@@ de@@ profiles ( see in ) , as well as the display of a job@@ site for the content of the server for each profile , by showing its own design . &quot;
in the under@@ window team configuration may be added or added or deleted as well as a mail@@ ing list . see in the details .
&quot; in the window of event , one can turn off event and add these actions to modify or delete these actions , when a previously defined event occurs , such as the backup of a file . see in the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , open &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the last project , which was opened . this behavior is currently not able to influence . &quot;
&quot; to open a different project , select a project ... from the menu project or the icon project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project is open and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , the project @-@ file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; modified files . same is when you load a new project . &quot;
&quot; there is free access to the files in the project . there , the files in the current project can be managed . &quot;
&quot; folder is just equally , but missing the entries opening and opening ... with the right mouse button of the context menu : &quot;
here you can download different profiles . the profile contains information about the place of the high @-@ set files .
&quot; allows the removal of the current profile . if only a profile is available , the button will finish in order to remove the removal . &quot;
the password will be kept in the core memory and be forgotten in programming . this possibility is useful if most frequent up@@ loading of files needed and the rather in@@ secure password on the plate is not saved .
this will stop the transfer or simply exit the dialogue if you think your opinion in front of the up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you can create many high@@ lighting profile , allowing the project ( or parts of the project ) to various server . &quot;
this is the server name to which the files are to be copied . either a fully qualified domain@@ name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for the up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; KDE ; and the installed ki@@ o sl@@ aves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; file ( locally ) and n@@ fs .
the port for transfer . normally this does not have to be changed except the network administrator does not manage a service to the usual port .
&quot; depending on your anxiety , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use them to your discretion . the password will be stored on the plate , so that it can not be easily read , but each with programming knowledge can be easily seen in the plain text . &quot;
a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bar . it can be loaded in a project many views , i.e. by simply touch@@ down the view can be downloaded and replace the current files and tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; views can be stored in the menu project or the project tool@@ bar , accessible via settings tools , can be opened or deleted . &quot;
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows adjustment of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to their own working method .
&quot; as mentioned above mentioned are tool @-@ like in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; best about the menu items can be designed . use and add @-@ lines , the addition of work@@ stations will be shown below in the section Add of tools . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar and the symbols may be set to be set up either via the context menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which the new tool can be set , resulting in the dialog box , which may be stated in the dialog , which may be stated on this or other tools . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will also remove the entries promotion and action was shown to be self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bar and the actions of them can set up in the menu with settings tools ... and settings actions set .. set .
&quot; templates are in essential tool@@ box , code ste@@ aks and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used Templates basically like a usual file system with extended organisation and interfaces . you can copy , move or any at the system existing directory in the pre @-@ bearing tree . templates have used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the limitations provided for the fil@@ es@@ ystem . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; standard templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions at the beginning of each template in front of the use exactly .
&quot; bin@@ ary is all that is not pure text . it can be included each file except text , so images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; bin@@ ary . bin@@ ary templates are usually included in documents using link@@ ages ( such as images with img src = / src / url ) . some examples can be found in case of a global templates . further information about the templates tree is available . &quot;
&quot; documents can be created by any text @-@ document . based on this templates , new documents can be created . normally , a simple rum@@ ors for the purpose and organis@@ ing the work in appropriate ways to be efficient . some examples can be found in a process tree under global templates . see in for more information about the templates . &quot;
&quot; this type of templates is useful , if not a new document may be inser@@ ted on a template but the same text area again . you can find everything , from a comment on a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl base . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates are organized for whole websites as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , in a comp@@ ressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &quot;
&quot; create a documentary structure to Bel@@ i@@ eben ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File As template save as a local template .... &quot;
once the happen is to note that ( even if it was stored as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the store of the project .
select Text in your document and click File As a template and save a selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be easily drag@@ ged with drag@@ ging and d@@ ending to the constructions templates . &quot;
the creation of bin@@ ary templates is simple : the file can only be used in one stem folder . it can be used all fil@@ esystem@@ s such as drag@@ ging and di@@ stor@@ ing or inser@@ ting across the file tree of Con@@ quer@@ or .
&quot; you can choose to create a folder on a folder to a folder and secure site template , select a name for the template and secure . by default , it is as a local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project managers allow a very goal @-@ oriented approach , or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or with them . additionally , you can connect to some things while using templates in projects very deep @-@ based in mind . &quot;
the pre @-@ layer structure in the window Templates is based on $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .k@@ r / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates ab@@ used files . each of this folder corresponds to one of four types of container , as above . &quot;
&quot; in order to specify the behavior of a folder , in the pre @-@ line overview with the right mouse button on the folder and select the following dialog box . the following dialogue will appear : &quot;
a sel@@ ector area with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is burned as soon as El@@ ter@@ ly attribute . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and fits all besides the root user in advance . if a regular folder would be dis@@ able , unless it would be explicitly enabled . in case of normal folder , the bl@@ ah would appear to be explicitly stated in the case of a normal folder . if nothing appears , one is probably in a trunk . &quot;
allows pre @-@ introduced or re@@ covered text for templates in this folder . these may be general head@@ line or foot@@ ers for all templates for a particular project and allows to ref@@ und a whole presentation already with the appropriate head@@ lines / foot@@ ers .
&quot; in addition , you have a context menu ( show right mouse button ) via a full command collection for adding folders or cop@@ ying templates from one place to another . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor that can be reached via the menu editor through the V@@ PL ; Editor and the branches of the editor parts into two parts : the source @-@ text editor and the V@@ PL ) editor .
the V@@ PL : -@@ Editor works as follows : it invites a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor . then you can edit and when needed to the source code into the V@@ PL ; Editor in the source code .
&quot; working with the V@@ PL ; Editor uses a document , the &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit these directly with the V@@ PL , editor . it is not possible to edit these directly with the V@@ PL , editor . there is still no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works just like the first , except that at the same time the changes are visible in the source@@ code editor and in the V@@ PL , Editor , and the cur@@ sor in the source@@ code editor and in the V@@ PL ; Editor is already active in the sources of the active cur@@ sor of a window to the other , whereby the position will be kept in the document . &quot;
the synchron@@ isation base between the V@@ PL ; Editor and the source@@ code editor can be adjusted via settings qu@@ anta .... after choosing V@@ PL ..... -@@ view it can be adjusted between synchroni@@ zation to one click or automatically . in addition the recommendation is automatically set the time span . basically the recommendation : a small sk@@ ill@@ et for fast computer and a large sp@@ oon for slow .
&quot; supp@@ ose you want to change the title of the website , so it is possible to choose the title of the website , this is the processing of invisible tags in working with the V@@ PL ; Editor is also possible , as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; Editor . this is intended to change the reduction of the suspension lat@@ ure . thus , one can change the following : &quot;
Meta @-@ tags allows the storage of information about the document itself . Meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons at the bottom or removed . one click in the list allows the change to the content , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword . &quot;
CSS rules are the new way to design of the out@@ look of pages in browser . you can add CSS rules with the buttons under the list or delete . a change over the list is exactly as with the Meta elements is currently not supported .
&quot; it is possible to include an external CSS style , by pressing on the file button and select the appropriate file . &quot;
&quot; the cur@@ sor of the cur@@ sor is as usual in a text processing , by Move with the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances . the mark@@ er does not work as usual . text can be inser@@ ted by typ@@ ing or remove or un@@ lock . &quot;
&quot; the inser@@ tion of tags is done in the same way through the tool@@ bar , as in the source@@ code editor . it is to be noted that the inser@@ tion of tags previously already existing identical tags is not removed e.g. when a an@@ chor day , surrounded by text , each other surrounding an@@ chor may be removed . &quot;
&quot; some materials like the tables @-@ Assi@@ stent or lists @-@ Assi@@ stent are disabled . you will later be used in &amp; V@@ PL , in this release the tables or lists materials must be used . &quot;
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for investigation of style sheets . in contrast to other programs for style sheets the search for certain elements can be track@@ ed and the execution of style publ@@ ishers may be pursu@@ ed .

there are many graphical tools to the compar@@ isons . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly declare why I wrote .
the co@@ aches was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ing had been fixed and at the same time at many places the ind@@ entation had correc@@ ted . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result were numerous conflicts in inter@@ ing .
&quot; the program I used to me only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines . and there were no advice on places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . the mer@@ ging of these changes had been a small night@@ mare . &quot;
so this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent the differences within a row and changes to white characters . later there were added any lot of other useful features .
&quot; if you would like to compare the text quickly , just copy it into the clip@@ board and add it to one of the compar@@ isons window . &quot;
&quot; one function made a lot of work , the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of folders . this function was turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a complete file browser . &quot;
&quot; even 3 @-@ way connections will also be fully supported . this is useful if two people work independently of each other at one piece of co@@ de and demonstr@@ ating the original file . in this editor you can even edit the result . in this editor , you can even edit the result . in this editor you can even edit the result of three Qu@@ ell files while playing : &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you with the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging complete folder . this screen shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder @-@ merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; indicates the exact differences and di@@ versi@@ fied the possibilities of active color mon@@ itors . if you need to check co@@ de you will need this function .
&quot; differences in white characters and tob@@ ul@@ ators are shown to be shown only in a certain number of white characters , one can see a look at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no trouble anymore if someone changes the ind@@ entation . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is equal , and the other is different in one line , then the colour indicates that file is different . red color means that both files are different . &quot;
&quot; if all the files are the same name , but in different folders , then you can simpli@@ fy the ti@@ pping work by just the filename of the first file . example : &quot;
diff@@ us@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 folder @-@ diff@@ 3 folder @-@ diff@@ 3 folder @-@ ner@@ 3 folder
opening @-@ dialog enables the manual inser@@ tion of fil@@ en@@ ames you select your selection and shows them next time . you must not specify the third file ; if you need the entry for C is empty the analysis of differences with two files .
&quot; via the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the compar@@ isons or mer@@ ging of folders will be selected , for B and C , but uses a folder , then use the filename from A to the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; if mer@@ ging , the input field is active for the goal and can be edit . it is not necessarily required , immediately a for@@ warding . you can do this step later when saving . &quot;
the set @-@ up button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before you start with the compar@@ isons / mer@@ ging .
&quot; sometimes one does not want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; # diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select fl@@ ecks on the active compar@@ isons of the clip@@ board . the comparison will then be able to select a file , you can simply connect the dialog with the Cancel button . &quot;
you can also use drag@@ ging and use : drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let him drop it on a compar@@ isons window .
&quot; which thought is behind it ? sometimes , it contains a file such as multiple similar functions . if you want to find out how similar to these functions , it would have to be able to load them into &amp; diff@@ 3 ; loading and they can be compared to them . now you can easily copy the relevant sections , and then compare them . &quot;
note : there are currently nothing to draw in and diff@@ use . only the falling text will be supported into a compar@@ ative window .
warning : some editors re@@ interpre@@ t the drag@@ ging and dra@@ fting of text into another program as a cut and paste ( instead of cop@@ ying and paste ) . in such case your original data could be lost .
&quot; in the upper part of each text windows , the info @-@ line of the sources window contains the characters A , B or C , the filename and the Z@@ eil@@ enn@@ u@@ mmer of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window is optional . ) E@@ ach Info @-@ Line has a while on the line . then a small au@@ xili@@ ary window will display the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three source @-@ windows are the letters A , B and C , the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pre@@ ferences can be changed via the Settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; if a difference is det@@ ected , one sees on the color which file is different . if both files are different . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . this is in the next section ( collapse ) . &quot;
&quot; left next to the text there is the summary columns . when differences have been found , the column shows the corresponding color . in case of some programming languages , the color is not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( with C / C + + , B. are white characters only in string chains and in few , rare items relevant . ) &quot;
the vertical line that separ@@ ates the abstr@@ acts column of the text is broken down in the areas where the respective source file has no lines . if the tick @-@ file is activated , the line will be displayed on the broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( among the compar@@ isons ) has also a info @-@ line with the inscription : , the filename and &#91; ... &#93; if you have edited the result . usually it contains the automatic combination already text , but often it contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are dis@@ solved in the memory ! ! ! ( use the buttons to be closest to the most remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two compar@@ isons are used , each difference is also a conflict that has to be replaced manually . &quot;
&quot; by one click with the left mouse button in one of the window will be shown on the line included in all windows , where the beginning of the group will not be visible in all windows , where the beginning of the group will not be visible . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , through automatic comp@@ ression or through manual up@@ wards there will be no further line more in the source ; then there is only a wild@@ card for the case that you may change your opinion and perhaps again another source . this text appears in a mark@@ ings that you might copy and paste . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; compli@@ ant versions ; however , on the clip@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . go careful with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting the sources ignore the options numbers , or ignore C / C + + comments are activated , make changes in numbers or comments also as white characters . &quot;
&quot; navig@@ ated mainly with the pictures and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys , right , at the beginning , end , Ctr@@ l @-@ early and Str@@ an end , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . the super@@ saf@@ er column can be used by clicking on the navig@@ ator . &quot;
in the show@@ case you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the insert button you can switch between the insert and transi@@ tions mode . ( pres@@ et is the dispos@@ able gem@@ o@@ dus . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchroni@@ zes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group ( as already described in the section and the edi@@ table output window was explained ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons to navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference ( Ctr@@ l @-@ picture / Str@@ g @-@ Picture / Str@@ g @-@ Bild ) , to the next / previous conflict ( Ctr@@ l @-@ Image up@@ wards ) or to the next / afor@@ emen@@ tion@@ ed conflict . therefore , you have to resolve conflicts between resolve and un@@ solved conflicts . &quot;
&quot; to copy the mark@@ ings to the clip@@ board , you have to copy the Copy @-@ button ( Ctr@@ l @-@ C or Ctr@@ l @-@ Insert ) . there is also the option selection automatically copy . if this option is automatically copied , because you could easily switch to the clip@@ board and manually . &quot;
z@@ eil@@ en@@ sive operating system are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix @-@ variants use a branch @-@ line \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 re@@ tains the source files that is why you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not with bin@@ ary files .
the options and the list of the last files used will be automatically saved and restored in the next start . ( menu item &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set ... )
&quot; select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also provides scrip@@ tures with variable width to choose from , you should not use them . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , the differences are displayed in cur@@ sive font . if the chosen script does not support this representation , nothing happened . &quot;
&quot; in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors will not be available in its pure form , but would be displayed properly . on these systems the button pre@@ ference automatically represents an un@@ lock color . &quot;
if this option is activated by pressing the tab@@ ulator button the corresponding number of spaces are inser@@ ted . otherwise a tab@@ ulator character is inser@@ ted .
&quot; if you enter or return , the ind@@ entation of the present line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; if this option is activated , each selection is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . the manual copy to the clip@@ board will then be copied . &quot;
you can choose which Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ende @-@ type you prefer . the pre @-@ set value is the common usual choice for the operating system .
&quot; when compar@@ ing files tries &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all completely identical lines will be ignor@@ ed in the source files . only during this first step can be white characters ignor@@ es . the second step compar@@ es any line . in this step , white characters will not be ignor@@ ed . even when there are white characters not ignor@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) store a honey@@ com@@ b &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , other in turn it appears . if this option is activated , wo@@ und@@ ing marks are visible , however , such as a white sign . during the gathering , this option does not have to be de@@ activated . in the default this option is disabled . &quot;
&quot; in the first part of the analysis , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis become numbers and related signs ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) . in the result , the differences are still indicated , but they are treated like white characters . &quot;
in the default this option is disabled . changes in comments will be treated as changes in white characters .
intensive after even smaller distinction . the option is activated in the default . it is effective for complicated and large files but slow in very large files .
&quot; in the automobile mode , this setting will be determined how long the result of the selection will be displayed , before the next un@@ solved conflict is further developed . &quot;
&quot; delete all conflicts in white signs by adding selected file as a source . ( pres@@ et is manual selection . ) This is useful if white characters in many files are less important , if you are using the functions of W@@ äh@@ le A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflict in numbers or comments , if the options are ignore or ign@@ ant C / C + + -@@ comments are activated . &quot;
these options are treated in the chapter for the scanning of folders and run a co@@ aches . look for details under documentation about the directory comparison and co@@ ding .
&quot; if a file is stored and already exists an older version , then the original version exists the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if already exists such a back@@ up@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without any other backup . &quot;
&quot; does the language of the user interface . the amend@@ ments of this option does not affect the current program . you have to stop and rest@@ art the current program . ( this option is active in the KDE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available , because the language is employed globally over the control center . ) &quot;
the following enco@@ ding settings can be adjusted for each entry separately . if you activate this option is used for all entries the upper setting .
over the sel@@ ing fields for co@@ ding appears a quick note that is the local co@@ ding . ( this can not be changed here and has a purely inform@@ al character . )
adjust the file enco@@ ding for source files . this influences such as special signs and interpre@@ ted . as the co@@ ding can be adjusted individually for each file can be compared with different co@@ ding and together .
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which co@@ ding should be used for stor@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processed error , they may not work with your code@@ c . ( for example , your files 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code may be only with 8 @-@ bit ASCII code . ) With this option one can specify the co@@ ding of the output of pre @-@ working command . &quot;
turn this from to supp@@ ose her@@ edi@@ ments of changes in white characters in the text or comments . ( note : this also applies to modifications in numbers or comments when the options are ignore or ignor@@ ed C / C + + -@@ comments are activated . )
&quot; this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a colour co@@ ded over@@ run column . but sometimes you may only see the differences between two of three files . &quot;
sometimes you would like to use the available space on the screen rather for long lines . check out the less important window . ( this option is in the window @-@ menu . )
orders the equ@@ ator side by side or over@@ other . this can also be useful to the ads on long lines . ( this option is in the window @-@ menu . )
sometimes you consider the differences and then opt @-@ up the files together in the mer@@ ging menu works also then if you only start two files . a simple click will start the compilation of the latest sources . ( if this function is used to start the mer@@ ging again , then the name of the last used output will re@@ tained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file it will first pass on this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then , the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ processor that you can use your own pre@@ processor . you can use this function or correct or correct the ind@@ entation . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file it will first be given to this external command ( see above ) , then the output of the command will only be used for the command of the command . you can write your own pre@@ processor , which corresponds exactly to your requirements . each entry line must have a related issue . &quot;
&quot; the thought behind it is to allow the user to allow greater flexibility when set up the Di@@ ff results , but most users want to program@@ med it . the good news is however , that in most cases sed or per@@ l perfectly adequate . &quot;
use this pre @-@ working command for tick @-@ time to convert the input in large letters . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; . * \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some key words used to insert text ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ key@@ word _ help \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ $ / \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \
&quot; while you experim@@ enting with sed experim@@ enting , you might want to understand it and maybe you like this regular expres@@ sions . they are very useful because there are many programs that are very similar things to support . &quot;
&quot; the I@@ gn@@ ating of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of a further pre @-@ working fault . &quot; &#91; &apos; , &apos; s / &#91; 0@@ 12345@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.- &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hits is replaced by nothing but qu@@ asi . &quot;
sometimes you may need several re@@ plac@@ ements at once . then you can use the semi@@ col@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the re@@ plac@@ ements from each other . example :
&quot; instead of sed , you can also use some other such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / switch &apos; aller@@ dings &apos; For per@@ l some details differently . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) requires per@@ l only ( and ) without the prec@@ eding &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
the data according to the normal Pre@@ processor will be kept for the ad and to inter@@ locking . the further operations change only the data that is the Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ab@@ rupt@@ cy @-@ Alg@@ ory@@ th@@ mus .
&quot; note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ab@@ ase the output of the normal pre@@ processor can be input . &quot;
&quot; the prec@@ eding orders are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or differences , you may not notice certain differences and in the worst case of important data . &quot;
often programmers need to edit programmers in a folder many files . for this reason you can compare with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder re@@ kur@@ si@@ v compare and merge .
... makes for every object a proposal to mer@@ ging ; you can custom@@ ize the proposal before the start
... can simul@@ ate the assem@@ bling and demonstr@@ ates the simul@@ ated changes without it really doing , &quot;
... guides selected actions to either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ;
this is similar to the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of individual files very similar . you just need to open the folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; if three folder will be mer@@ ged , then folder 1 is used as a basis . if no target has been used , uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not the mer@@ ging . to run the mer@@ ging , you have to select the appropriate menu entry or the F@@ 7 button . ( more details will follow . ) &quot;
&quot; during the reading of the folder you will be informed about the current progress . if you de@@ eds the folder of the folder , only the files are listed below . &quot;
&quot; when the folder is completed the folder is , displays &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list of the results on the left side , ... &quot;
each file and each folder obtained during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is normally presented together . you can double folder by clicking on the + / - or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu includes two functions all sub @-@ directories and all sub @-@ directories with which you can convert all the folder and folders .
&quot; if you double click on a file , the file comparison will be started and it will be a compar@@ ative window . &quot;
the symbol in the column name reflects the records in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; when the data type is different in the other folder , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object . in such a case the mer@@ ging action cannot be automatically selected . if the collapse will be started automatically , you will be informed about problems of this kind again . &quot;
&quot; as in the above picture , it is used in the columns A / B / C the colors red , green , yellow and black . &quot;
&quot; in identical entries , the colour is also identical , even if the age of entries is different . &quot;
&quot; folder will be considered identical , if you accum@@ ulated contents are identical . then also folder the same color . with folders , the age is in@@ significant for its color . &quot;
&quot; the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow is and later if it is old . &quot;
&quot; a and C identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a and B identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; B and C identical , but not A : copy from A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... A , B and C not have the same data type ( e.g. if A a folder and B is a file ) : error : contradic@@ tory disc types . as long as such fa@@ ver@@ ish objects can not be started . &quot;
... A and B not have the same data type ( e.g. if A folder and B file is ) : error : conflic@@ ting dat@@ eit@@ yp@@ es . as long as such fa@@ ver@@ ish objects can not be started .
&quot; the mode of synchroni@@ ze is active , if only two folder and no exp@@ licit target folder and if the option directories are synchroni@@ ze . then select and diff@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action is identical , so that both files are identical . if for an entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but not identical in both folders and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible filename for the output file only B ; directly after the inter@@ play &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B by A. )
&quot; if two folder will be mer@@ ged and select the option New File ( un@@ certain ) , then examined &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of files and suggests the same file to cop@@ ying , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such mistakes can not be elimin@@ ated , the mer@@ ging of the folder can not be started . &quot;
&quot; while working will work a file after the other . you status @-@ column shows Fer@@ ry to when the mer@@ ging was successful , and according to other messages , if something un@@ expected occurred , if the mer@@ ging process , should you take a final check and see whether the status is anywhere in order . &quot;
&quot; if in the interior dialog the file property method is chosen , K@@ Diff@@ 3 other columns will display . these contain the number of un@@ solved conflicts , sol@@ dered , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for sol@@ dered conflicts will be compared or together . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the currently selected entry ( File or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the mer@@ ging actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the mer@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you do not have a target folder , then in the Three @-@ folder combination @-@ mode C is used as a target , in the two @-@ folder interaction will be elected as destination and is used for synchron@@ ise A and / or B as a goal . &quot;
&quot; if you have chosen a target folder , please check whether all entries should be displayed in the target structure , also in the folder structure . there are some options to be displayed in the folder structure . check out these options to avoid un@@ pleasant sur@@ prises : &quot;
&quot; to add all entries : select directory mer@@ ging / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard short@@ cut ) . to run only the current entry : select action of the current element , or press F@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; if by contradic@@ tory data types still exist , a message appears to the missing elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; if you merge all entries , a dialog window appears with the options possible , simul@@ ate and break . &quot;
&quot; choose if you only want to see what would happen , without the really changes done . you will then get a detailed list of all actions . &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; leads certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is required ( composed of a single file ) then opens up a mer@@ ging window ( note the screen ) .
&quot; if you are ready to start with a file , select again directory / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved a corresponding dialog . then , then , and diff@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; to a mistake , a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you will be able to help you to select the cause of the problem . so , you have the opportunity to select a different action for the entry or to solve the problem in another way before you continue with the collapse . &quot;
&quot; if some entries are individually controlled , mer@@ lin@@ ing and diff@@ use of all entries in the current session ) and leads them during the later inter@@ section of all entries . even if here the mer@@ ging process has been done or not saved , these entries will be carried out again . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set ... ) now has a section called directory mer@@ ging with these options :
only files that fit on the specified pattern are displayed in the element @-@ tree . separate the pattern with a semi@@ col@@ on ; . a valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is required to do not match this pattern .
files and folders containing this pattern will not be displayed in the el@@ baum . it can be more than a pattern : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders containing this pattern will not be displayed in the el@@ baum . it can be more than a pattern : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignor@@ ed files that would also be ignor@@ ed from CV@@ S . many aut@@ mati@@ cal generated files are ignor@@ ed by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder can be set with a .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some fil@@ esystem@@ s files have files a comp@@ artment attribute . in other fil@@ esystem@@ s . this option allows you to decide whether these files will be displayed in the el@@ baum or not . this option is swit@@ ched on the default .
&quot; with links to files : if the option is swit@@ ched , symbo@@ lic link is compared . if the option is swit@@ ched , the files are compared to which the links shown . this is disabled . &quot;
&quot; if the option is displayed , the symbo@@ lic links are compared . if the option is swit@@ ched , the links like normal folders will lead and recur@@ si@@ vely through . &quot;
&quot; per@@ forms a complete analysis of each file through and shows the statistics of columns , un@@ resolved , non @-@ wel@@ ded and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is s@@ lower than a simple bin@@ ary analysis , and significantly s@@ lower when it is applied to files that is no text contained in files . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folder about a long network , it possibly takes place faster , only the change @-@ date and the file size to compare . this speed benefits makes you use . this option is swit@@ ched in the default . &quot;
&quot; similar to confidenti@@ ality of the f@@ ears issue . there is no real comparison instead . the files will be considered identical , if they are equal . that can be useful for example when using the f@@ using date . this option is in the default . &quot;
activ@@ ates the synchroni@@ ze mode if two folder has been compared and no target folder was specified in this mode . in this mode the suggestions are identical to the mer@@ ging of files will be stored in both folders . this option is swit@@ ched in the default .
&quot; if there are differences , the cop@@ ying of the newer file is proposed as action . ( this is considered un@@ certain because the other file is not changed . ) This option is swit@@ ched in each case . ) This option is swit@@ ched in each case . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced by another one or deleted , then the original version is already named and receives the extension .@@ a file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension . this also affects the normal interaction of individual files , not only the mer@@ ging of individual files , not only the mer@@ ging of individual files . this option is swit@@ ching in the default . &quot;
&quot; usually , the folder I will stick to the mer@@ ging of individual files visible ; you can switch the window to window with the mouse . if you do not want you to switch the option directory &amp; text windows , you can switch the option directory &amp; text windows , you can switch the option directory and text window to switch between the two views . &quot;
probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ click . however , there is a single file directly together without the folder you need to start the folder and the file will not run again when you run the folder . &quot;
&quot; however , this status will be lost , if you read the directory again : new directory menu : new read &quot;
KDE supports network transparent with the help of KI@@ O Sl@@ aves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this for reading files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders for opening up on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with an on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a comp@@ ressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has another syntax as local files and folder . a few things you should consider :
a path can be relatively un@@ . or .. contained . this is not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolutely . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be m@@ ask@@ ated . ( # - &gt; % 23 , id@@ zei@@ chen@@ - &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example has a file with the name / # foo # the URL file : / % 23@@ foo % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes because of the fil@@ es@@ ystem on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a brief list of con@@ stra@@ ints : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be distinguished whether a link indicated to a file or folder . then , a file will always be accepted as a link interface . ( FTP : , s@@ ftp : ) . &quot;
there is no possibility to edit per@@ missions or modification of date . therefore , the per@@ missions or modification of the original . ( note the option of confidence of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files possible ) . &quot;
&quot; the main purpose of use is currently being able to launch in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op will first start the built @-@ in differences . in order to launch k@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; normally , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is applied as a part in the Unified format . then , there is a patch file in the patch file . then , the file does not start to restore the missing file . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch re@@ produce the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the con@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . furthermore , this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable , if the original files has been changed since gener@@ ating the patch file . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part runs , it only supports the compar@@ isons of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . the mer@@ ging or the same of folders is not supported in the CIP mode . &quot;
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now a comp@@ iler ) exists . moreover , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can result in diff@@ use as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff @-@ tool collection . &quot;
I use GPL programs already very long and have learned much by going into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programmers who passed this path or let him go .
you have compiled the program from sources and the configure script probably not be shared with the right Pre@@ fix for KDE . in the pres@@ et installed configure in / usr / local , but then KDE can not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ rc ) . in the RE@@ ADM@@ E file you will find more detailed information on this topic . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white signs is different , these lines are described as identical , but if only a non @-@ white sign is variable , the line will be treated as an not identical . if similar lines named next to each other , this is this is in the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor mer@@ ing for any difference in the files where it begins and where he ends . this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and select the button A / B / C , and it is much effort to create an own file format , which could store this information . &quot;
the effort for this was so far too big . you can always restore a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text should be used to edit a different editor .
&quot; after remove text is suddenly ; no src , released ; and the text cannot be clear . what does that mean and how can this be removed ? &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; use many colors to emphas@@ iz@@ ing differences . even more down@@ wards would be conf@@ using and l@@ acks the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and trou@@ bles came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !

cut @-@ cut ( Ctr@@ l @-@ X or Shift from the selected text . insert ( Ctr@@ l @-@ V or Shift ) adds the text from the clip@@ board to the current currency position and replace the current mark@@ ings .
&quot; only differences : files that are identical in all folders are not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the target structure . &quot;
( in the current program version you need to change the folder to these options the folder with the function Update . )
&quot; there are only entries displayed that identical files will not be copied , if the target will not be copied to the target folder . if the target folder these files are not already mentioned , they are missing in a later program version probably modified . ) This option is swit@@ ched in a later program version . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to choose from the source with the label A , B and C below the menu . if you are on one of the buttons , the lines are already available in the end of the selected group on the result of the selected group in the result , they will be available when clicking the button . &quot;

&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini@@ ature of all virtual work surfaces . it is quite convenient to change the ongoing programs on desktop , to end it or move it . this works in both desktop and more . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work surfaces as well as those who can display running applications . the applications can be selected and even moves on desktop and other .
with the middle mouse button can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible within a working area as well as other work@@ spaces .
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button click here : if on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; click , the context menu has only been set up within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and complete . if there is only the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minimi@@ ze , Maximi@@ eren , On desktop and end . the commands may include : &quot;
max@@ imi@@ zing the application window to the full size of the desktop . appears only if on one application was installed .
send the application to selected virtual work@@ space . appears only if you click on an application .
&quot; marked this chapter field , window can be moved within the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work surfaces . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , will be displayed in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the names of virtual work spaces are displayed . &quot;
&quot; cru@@ ise this field leaves the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of virtual work@@ spaces display . is it together with name display , the names are provided with Ord@@ in@@ let , &amp; eg ; 1 work@@ space . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also shown as background in the box . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the current programs are displayed as a small window in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only the empty work@@ spaces are shown to allow them to choose from . &quot;
here is the view of the program window . simply shows simple rect@@ angles with the pro@@ portions of the program window . icon showing a small view of the real program name . note : Pix@@ map is recommended only for very fast systems .
&quot; here , the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the main window will appear : classic lets &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , known as of P@@ ager applications in some other Window@@ manager ; horizont@@ ally shows all virtual work surfaces in a vertical line , which is very good for viewing on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to P@@ ager &apos;s mini @-@ program in the control bar . he has the advantage that he can display in size , the windows as symbols or with its content . &quot;
click the right mouse button within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent out@@ lets from switch @-@ switch ... makes the dialogue settings appear .
currently this cannot be changed in the dialog settings . you can do this but manually do :

&amp; k@@ mag ; is a screenshot . you can click with &amp; k@@ mag ; one part of the screen would like to use a magni@@ fier for the small printed or the accurate view@@ ers . this documentation is a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag .
&amp; k@@ likes ; is a very powerful application that is constantly enhanced by new features . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance computers .
&quot; if you like , start a window as shown above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; indicates the enlar@@ ged area of the screen .. the image that is displayed in the enlar@@ ged window , is an enlar@@ ged area of the screen and is described as a sel@@ ector window . &quot;
&quot; in the default it is enlar@@ ged , the area around the cur@@ sor like a mov@@ able magni@@ fier . alternatively , you can get a selected screen @-@ area in the magni@@ fying window ( drop @-@ window ) or the surrounding area of the mouse window on the screen ( eg ; at the left of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to avoid that the mouse cur@@ sor in enlar@@ ged window , select the setting cur@@ sor in the enlar@@ ged window . please note that &amp; k@@ mag ; this is still not able to identify the shape of the mouse button . this is always the default KDE . / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse @-@ cur@@ sor . &quot;
in the sel@@ ector mode you can adapt the sel@@ ective window to your needs . you can change it with the arrow - and Mau@@ sta@@ sts and change its size . this can be done in the following ways :
move the mouse window in the magni@@ fying window and keep the left mouse button pressed so you can catch the content of the enlar@@ ged window and move . it also goes with the arrow keys .
&quot; if you are in addition to the &amp; Shift ; switch , or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can move the drop @-@ down window . &quot;
with this combination you can change the size of the sel@@ ective window . note that the upper left corner of the sel@@ ective window remains and only the lower right corner to move .
&amp; k@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the magni@@ fied picture directly to the printer to copy the clip@@ board ( to add it later to other applications ) to adjust the picture and much more .
start or stops the update of the display . the st@@ opping the up@@ dating causes the required CPU @-@ time against 0 .
&quot; choose the Re@@ alization rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , means , Ho@@ ch , Very high ) . the higher the actu@@ alization rate , the more CPU @-@ time is required . &quot;
this mode is displayed in this mode . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&quot; user &apos;s automatically uses your inser@@ ted short@@ list for stor@@ ing files , opening a new window , printing , ne@@ ul@@ ads ( with the kno@@ b document again in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , magni@@ fying and decre@@ es &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; may also be known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screenshot . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; for this use an area of the screen , as if you use a magni@@ fier , in order to use the mini@@ ature order in a newspaper or a photo . this application is for various people of benefits : from research or artist up to the web@@ masters or attractions . &quot;
detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mag ( enter either this URL to the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; one or run k@@ help@@ center help : / k@@ mag ) .
&amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; was developed by Ola@@ f Schmidt oj@@ sch@@ midt @ k@@ de@@ .org and Sar@@ ang Lak@@ are Sar@@ ang @ user@@ s.@@ sf@@ .net and Michael For@@ ster for@@ ster @ f@@ mi.@@ uni @-@ pass@@ au@@ .de .
&amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates an mouse click as soon as the cur@@ sor is a while on the same point . it is thought to help people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome ( Rep@@ eti@@ tive @-@ Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury syndrome ) and those of each mouse @-@ click pain .
&amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates an mouse click on the same point as soon as the cur@@ sor is thought to help people who suffer the Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and where each mouse @-@ click pain . also it does not require a little exercise .
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain that comes when clicking the mouse , and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately you are suffering from your computer to use your computer , you should not find a doctor if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to make it even more clear : even if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain helps , when clicking with the mouse , it is against pain that is caused by the Move of the mouse , it is against pain that may be caused by the Move of the mouse . and as with all ergonomic ai@@ ds : the result can affect anyone . &quot;
the use of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; super@@ vised your mouse moving and takes a mouse click off as soon as you break the movement short .
&quot; the smart move is activated , makes &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause , after it gets the mouse button . move the mouse , is waiting to run the mouse button . in this way you can run the drag@@ ging with pressed mouse button . this way you can get a little exercise , but you get used quickly on it . &quot;
this delay must be block@@ ed after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse @-@ click apart .
&quot; is Intel@@ ligent Ver@@ move swit@@ ched ( 1 / 10 s ) active . here the time is shut down , the &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , is waiting for the mouse button before it leaves the mouse button again , if the mouse button will not get rid of the mouse . &quot;
&amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now the Click @-@ shift . this function is activated now , creates a long @-@ click on the left and back , followed by a break , one click with the right mouse button . a long @-@ click . these movements are started in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt ; the first time is started , but they can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; when the sound is compens@@ ated , you can move and KDE ; for this , you go to sound &amp; Multimedia , choose the &amp; sound system and here the rider structure . there is a slider bar @-@ buff@@ er that you set up to a lower value to short@@ cut the answers . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is marked , &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; start with each start of &amp; KDE . this function is currently only under &amp; KDE ; available . with GNO@@ ME or other window@@ s@@ ings please draw the respective documentation to rate to figure out how to start there a program . &quot;
&quot; sets all settings to values back , which were set when opening the dialogue . have you already pressed the button of users , the settings will be reset after the last g@@ aps of users . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , first to use with pre@@ ferences . especially the intelligent verse should leave you first off . if you then click on the automatic mouse button , you can later take the smart move . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is possible if necessary to reduce the answers from &amp; KDE . &quot;
&quot; first you should make yourself aware of which places a mouse @-@ click without effect , the Click on the neutral components of windows or on places in browser window which does not lead to un@@ certain reactions . you can therefore use the mouse at such sites until you want to use them again . &quot;
&quot; when your mouse be printed , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the tri@@ ck is to clean , but also the roles that comes with the mouse ball in touch . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to see the mouse ball . as this happens , is different from mouse to mouse . it should be quickly clear when you view the under@@ side of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the reels . these are located at the sides of the Lo@@ ches , which was the ball . the dirt and dirt sti@@ cking lets you easily handle with a flat blade or the fing@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system has started the execution of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if just started in this case the intelligent fort@@ shift , meaning that &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool means that the surgery cannot finish by the button of the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; using another window manager and move a window .
the solution to this problem is that you yourself set up a mouse click . this is the status of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; reset and you can work as usual .
problem : if you enter text trying &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to exec@@ ute and sets the cur@@ sor to another place .
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor to place where you want to have a key@@ stroke part of the mouse button , if you are unable to create a key@@ stro@@ kes . secure zones for the cur@@ sor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bar and menus and the cover lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the Intel@@ ligent shift , but I do not create it to edit them text . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent fort@@ move is an advanced function of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it needs its time , before you can handle the clip@@ board to move it into the clip@@ board , if you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . however , there will probably help you some problems . here are some ad@@ vices for this : &quot;
use the intelligent shift if you just start to start &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . mark the text instead of the text area and keep the switch @-@ down key while you move the mouse button on the other end of the text and there again left the mouse button .
&quot; so you use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this is pressing a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when the smart shift starts out . later , you can use the intelligent ver@@ slide also without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , there needs some exercise . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use , the X@@ Test @-@ extension must be installed for &amp; X @-@ Window . this should be the case on most system . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound@@ card and speaker features and this is correct .
&amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pra@@ ises the mouse button as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor soon . this program was developed for people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome and those who use the an@@ tigen of the Mau@@ sta@@ ins pain .
&amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured so that there is a certain time it is waiting for a number of time before the mouse button will start . in this way you can also get the drag@@ ging and d@@ ending with the mouse .

&quot; Festival is a language issue of the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh supports . the license allows to use Festival for free and dis@@ semin@@ ated without restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the language output , is assumed that the festival in the folder / usr / local / festival is installed . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written language generator . currently , he only supports the English language . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge and dis@@ semin@@ ated without restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for the establishment of the language issue , is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ ettes is installed . the language issue is then possible with one of the three following command examples : &quot;
for the third example the option must be enabled as default one . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . he conver@@ ts a list of phon@@ emen in a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to explo@@ it the text in phon@@ eme . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
in our example H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text in phon@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA under the assu@@ mption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA will be installed in / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
&quot; unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax will be happy to add the final sign of the text so that an additional character has to be added . the complete command is therefore consu@@ ming than in the other examples : &quot;
( cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / mb@@ fax / d@@ xt@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BAR / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ I@@ LA / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in a line . the option dates as default will be enabled to be on .
&quot; the voice @-@ dem@@ on from &amp; KDE ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; KDE ; -@@ further voice , which provides an standard interface for language output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different levels of language systems . &quot;
&quot; as the setting of the language generator occurs only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you just need to use as a language service as a language service . &quot;
&quot; to set the page K@@ TT@@ SD @-@ voice , which appears in the Settings dialog by &amp; km@@ outh ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; km@@ outh ; successfully to use a language generator ( and of course , KDE ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; km@@ outh ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , which depends on your computer and configuration . &quot;
&quot; km@@ outh ; is an application with the people who can not speak , text by the computer . there is a list already sung phr@@ ases that the users can always have been released again . &quot;
note that &amp; km@@ outh ; no voice syn@@ thesizer . on the computer must be installed a voice @-@ syn@@ thesizer .

&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; - the language output system of &amp; KDE ; - is a made of modules of existing service , which allows every application to make text about the &amp; D@@ bus ; interface . &quot;
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub@@ system in &amp; KDE ; to language issue ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; KDE ; -@@ programmers ready to be equipped with their applications with T@@ TS skills . also users offers interesting options .
&quot; reproduction of texts ( or parts thereof ) in the text editor , even if &amp; k@@ ate ; in other &amp; KDE ; -@@ applications embedded . &quot;
&quot; the language issue is done by the program speech @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher , which uses different background program such as espe@@ ak , festival , etc . &quot;
enables the production of language spending on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) about the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; -@@ help program .
&quot; in Z@@ UK@@ UN@@ FT : support for Speech @-@ Mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Speech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Speech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Meta ( SM@@ ML ) . &quot;
&quot; the Speech Service of &amp; KDE ; , an application without visible window , the T@@ TS services over &amp; D@@ bus . &quot;
an application with &amp; GUI ; to configure and setup by kt@@ ts@@ d via kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the system section .
a module for the web browsers &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for the registration of the texts of a website or parts thereof .
a module for the Text@@ editor &amp; k@@ ate ; with which a text file can be completely or partly read .

&quot; before you &amp; kt@@ ts , you can install program speech @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher and set right . see also
&quot; at the first start of ct@@ t@@ sm@@ osis or as long as yet no spok@@ es@@ man , the card card will be displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker will be displayed , the map card will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS @-@ Syn@@ thesizer offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female , or those that are different in volume or speed . you should at least use multiple variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least use a speaker before you use , because the program speed dis@@ pat@@ cher otherwise used the standard . &quot;
various spok@@ es@@ person for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable with several pressure awa@@ ited for the same printer .
if you click on the Kart@@ ei@@ box spok@@ es@@ man in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr . this appears now automatically when you start boot@@ y and not yet been set up a speaker .
all already decorated speaker will appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear at the top of the list . the top speaker will be used for language issue when an application does not apply to a spok@@ es@@ man .
select a mouse @-@ click on the list and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
select a mouse @-@ click on the list and click on this button to change the settings below .
select a mouse click on the list and click on this button to move the spok@@ es@@ man in the list a line further down . the order of the speakers in the list is also reflected their priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current field ; -@@ system to apply .
&quot; choose one voice type , there are three male and three female voices as well as a junk@@ - and gir@@ th voice to choose from . &quot;
&quot; if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the map @-@ speaker speaker . to change the settings of this tool , click Edit . &quot;
&quot; now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost use . go back to the map @-@ card , and check whether the T@@ TS @-@ service from &amp; KDE ; start . now , you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; click on the map to create text applications and manage to manage text . &quot;
&quot; if you have at least one speaker , you can start the voice system from &amp; KDE . click on the kart@@ ing box . here you can set up some general options . &quot;
&quot; highlight this subscription required to enable the &amp; kt@@ ts ; system to enable the map @-@ T@@ TS @-@ Service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this start is successful , and you can create text applications , and you can create text applications , and you can create text applications and the T@@ TS @-@ System from &amp; KDE . &quot;
&quot; if kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is finished , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; next , if the field voice is activated ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; this chapter is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr appears automatically when you automatically appears in the system area of the check@@ bar , it appears again as soon as the entry has been completed . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series you can start text @-@ up , break up , stop and res@@ ume . &quot;
with the buttons in this series you can leave the current text in the &amp; KDE ; clip@@ board support or a text @-@ file for the entry . you can also switch to the spok@@ es@@ man for an order .
click on users or OK then all modified settings are taken on all pages .
&quot; the card @-@ card orders will be shown only if K@@ TT@@ SD was started to launch K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the card @-@ card size and cross language output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser from &amp; KDE ; , you can first download the text of displayed on site . then , select the text , the read , and select the text of text . after a short time the language output should start . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ pre @-@ voltage and other invisible brands also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ ate ; the extended Text@@ editor of &amp; KDE ; , you can check out text as if &amp; kt@@ ts ; running . select the text , the read , and choose the language tools . then you should start the language issue . &quot;
&quot; this also works , if &amp; k@@ ate ; in other applications are embedded , as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; qu@@ anta ; &quot;
&quot; K@@ Noti@@ fy is the news system of &amp; KDE ; to noti@@ fy you by you specified events . you can also leave the text of this messages also by &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ conversation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; KDE ; , you can set different kinds of messages . you can be noti@@ fied when in a IR@@ C channel , you can be noti@@ fied when in a IR@@ C channel , you can get into your nickname . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then get the IR@@ C message . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; KDE , program K@@ Noti@@ fy , appears a menu item al@@ erts in the menu settings of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy are different depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; filter for the strings offer a good option in &amp; kt@@ ts ; false st@@ ressed , or missing messages to correct . it is a good example . it removed the tags / local / In@@ box , as this in most cases can be accepted as provided . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced skills of &amp; kt@@ ts ; . for normal working with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; in filter@@ ing , text will be processed , before he will be sent to the program speech , to select wrong words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and spok@@ es@@ man or to handle certain def@@ ects of language syn@@ thesi@@ zers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the working method of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; with a text works . &amp; kt@@ ts ; make four types of texts . &quot;
the output of screen reproduction has the highest priority . it will be held to all other orders and keeps these orders to . if the issue of screen reader will be read again .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this stage is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is to be hot reserved . a warning has pre@@ ference and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be continued according to the issue of warning .
&quot; News have the nearest priority . a message under@@ breaks normal text . &amp; km@@ outh ; is an example of an application that can be used . while you &amp; eg ; a long text on a website , you can welcome the room . &amp; KDE ; -@@ al@@ erts are also news . read about it . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple ess@@ ays . each order , which you use from the card payments , is a text addition . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of an application that are text applications . text applications are meant for the output of leng@@ thy lyrics that have no particular ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four comm@@ issions are working in queue , except the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application will send the output of screen reduction , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one of them reads , this issue will be stopped and ended . &quot;
&quot; first , you must know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen reduction . you will be applied to normal al@@ war@@ nings , messages and text applications as well as on and KDE ; -@@ messages . &quot;
filter edit the text and give it to the next filters . at the time there are three types of filters .
filter are executed as modules . in the future there can still be further types of filters .
&quot; string qu@@ ets replace parts of a text by other text . you can specify either as words or as regular expres@@ sions , which enable the creation of chat @-@ em@@ otes , such as : - ) by text or for the form@@ att@@ ing of messages from &amp; kon@@ conversation ; or &amp; K@@ mail ; in a better understanding form . &quot;
&amp; XML ; -@@ Trans@@ former use X@@ S@@ LT @-@ File ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format into another format . in the delivery of &amp; XHTML ; are some X@@ S@@ LT files to the translation of &amp; XHTML ; in SS@@ ML .
&quot; with Spre@@ ader spreading , you can order orders depending on the content of your text or depending on the program , which can send the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; if you have an opportunity to use a female voice for example , you can leave the text by KDE messages about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters made adjustable rules , after which it is applied to a language output . if the filter noted that its rules does not apply , he returns the text un@@ changed to the next filters . &quot;
&quot; if a text supplement , a message , warning or a &amp; KDE ; message to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it will be edited by all activated filters , which are arranged on the page below . the processing is done in order from the top down . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of the furnished normal filters . if a filter is not enabled , it is not activated and will not be used . filter will be connected to the range from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of the filter , and it will continue to display below the below setup . &quot;
&quot; for the establishment of strings , you have to enter a list of words or regular expres@@ sions as a compar@@ isons balance . these patterns are ex@@ changed in the text , then the text against the corresponding replacement text is ex@@ changed . &quot;
&quot; enter your filter one name . this name allows you to select any number , it just needs to distingu@@ ish only by the name of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expres@@ sions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column in accordance with the string . the list is shown in the displayed sequence from top to bottom .
click here to move the marked word or the regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can upload a list of words or regular expres@@ sions from a file to save the current list or delete a list from a file , the entries will be raised from the file to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; here is a language entered , the filter is only applied when the speaker is one of the here registered languages . click on the button to view a list of languages . you can also select several languages if you are looking at the mouse click the &amp; Ctr@@ l ; button pressed . &quot;
&quot; here is a value registered , the filter will be used only when the text appears from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by com@@ mat@@ a . example : conversation , K@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application ID @-@ ID programs get you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ numbers need to leave you away . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus , the application @-@ ID kop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 . &quot;
the string qu@@ ette filter will be applied only to the text if any circumstances with an entry in the box di@@ ets filter apply if the filter is empty , the filter will be applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; when comparison of words used the string qu@@ inc@@ ers , regular expres@@ sions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ator ( spaces ) . &quot;
in this manual you will not find instructions for writing regular expres@@ sions . if you have installed the &amp; KDE ; editor &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expres@@ sions you can find in the package k@@ ort@@ ti@@ ls .
&amp; XML ; -@@ Trans@@ former translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ S@@ LT files in a format . X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such re@@ form@@ ations . it can be used only on well @-@ shaped XML . the help program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the ambi@@ ent variable P@@ AT@@ H as well as x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; using the speaker selection , you can send text to a particular speaker , which is set up on the map card , or to a spok@@ es@@ man with certain features . you can specify that texts by K@@ mail from a female voice should be read . see . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text to the filter comes , it is looking for a spok@@ es@@ man for the text . the spok@@ es@@ person is selected based on the speaker features , which is the program that allows the text to &amp; kt@@ ts . with the speaker selection , you can over@@ write the chosen speaker . &quot;
&quot; here is a value registered , the filter is applied , if the text is applied to the given regular expression . it is installed on your system of the &amp; KDE ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regul@@ ators , you can call it with one click on the button to get help with the input . &quot;
&quot; to achieve a faster processing , you should try to an@@ chor the regular expression in the beginning of the string , i.e. , begin the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; place here the properties of the required filters . if the text is set the above filter conditions , the speaker is selected to display the desired requirements at the bottom . click on the button to see the dialog box . &quot;
use these buttons to save or delete or delete all settings .
&quot; the inter@@ section filter is applied only to the text if any circumstances with an entry in the box di@@ ets filter apply if applicable . you need to be at least one condition . &quot;
&quot; the Speech API , by &amp; KDE ; , with the programmer can give their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD over &amp; D@@ Bus ; &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the syn@@ thesizer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , allowing you to use this syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; KDE ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of the language output API of &amp; KDE ; the complete documentation for both API@@ s can be found on the KDE ; Acces@@ sibility website ( http : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications call for language levels via the &amp; D@@ bus ; interface from &amp; KDE ; from the program r@@ ts@@ d across the object K@@ Speech .
&quot; here , text of the text for the entry and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc . &quot;
there are more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands
&quot; open two &amp; kon@@ sole , window . start the tune in a window , then kt@@ sp@@ h in the other . &quot;
none of the mentioned voice syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Um@@ stands filter , but when using the module for the festival will not be read . &quot;
&quot; due to a bug in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone so that you do not need to use it if you do not need to use this voice to the use of web pages . you also need to find this voice to the use of x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c and can be found via the ambi@@ ent variable P@@ AT@@ H . &quot;
certain characters or p@@ unc@@ tu@@ ation appear to cause errors in syn@@ thesi@@ zers so that whole sent@@ ences are issued or only gi@@ b@@ oc@@ ular . what can I do against it ?
&quot; at first , make sure that the option are co@@ ding to the right value for the appropriate language . there are problems with certain characters or words , these may possibly be fixed by a string qu@@ eries filter . &quot;

&quot; syn@@ thesi@@ zers , which are used by &amp; kt@@ ts ; have their own license that you can find in the documentation or on the relevant websites . there are also voices that have a separate license . &quot;
&quot; if you have access to the KDE source code , you can download the package with &amp; kt@@ ts ; it can be found in the directory area . also , you will find the source code of k@@ de@@ cks at ftp : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / KDE . &quot;
includes many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the page http : / / www.k@@ ak@@ .s@@ ource@@ forge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; Swedish English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zulu and Ibi@@ bio . &quot;
K@@ T@@ TS works with each language syn@@ thesizer found on the command line in a &amp; console .
&quot; the list of mentioned languages can be in@@ complete or out@@ dated . draw up the description of syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . look at the website of ct@@ ts ; , according to information that are not yet included in this manual . &quot;
&quot; the program &quot; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; uses an adap@@ table module @-@ architecture for language syn@@ thesizer . if you like &amp; kt@@ ts ; for the use of another syn@@ thesi@@ zers , contact the development team . &quot;
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is not necessary . Debian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command ap@@ t @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; to comp@@ ile , you need a current development environment from KDE ( Version 3.4 or newer ) including the packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the Developer Files for the program &quot; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher . &quot;
if you refer to the sources of &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source archive for k@@ de@@ ko@@ ve or have downloaded the program her@@ es T@@ arb@@ all and install the program with the following commands :
&quot; before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use , check first as speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher with your language syn@@ thesizer . you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf . &quot;
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; KDE ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; that will be the program speech by speech . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ g is intended to be developed directly and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is under@@ lined in individual pro@@ positions . the user can leave S@@ atz@@ - or Cancel rep@@ uted to repeat the output or break down .
&quot; if an application text was added to &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is possible to specify the properties of your prefer@@ ed intercom for the output . so , it can be used for example a female English speaker , whose language is English and its sex female , it is automatically chosen by the best matching speaker . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a spok@@ es@@ man chosen , see you in . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the map speaker on adding , and to add a spok@@ es@@ man to the list or click Edit speaker . as an example is shown below the setup of the module for Festival Interactive . details of the modules can be found under . &quot;
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path is to Festival in P@@ AT@@ H you just have to enter festival .
&quot; choose the co@@ ding for text , which is transferred to the festival . if voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts ; commonly used , that western languages is ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , eastern languages as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these sli@@ ders , you set volume , intercom speed and sound height of the synthe@@ tic language . if you can not select some controllers and this is the gray one lets you choose these settings . &quot;
&quot; some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices require a number of seconds to be loaded because of their size , these voices are already loaded with the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( with greater memory consumption ) is the first set of rapid syn@@ thesi@@ zed . &quot;
if this request can not be selected if you have not yet been set up a spok@@ es@@ man ( or forget to click user ) .
&quot; is this chapter area marked , is visible at the start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr . otherwise , after the start only the icon is visible in the system section , but not the program in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; this chapter is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not run it , appears in the system range , as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD will read a text as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD , you have the opportunity to stop you or go elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; here are all orders listed in the queue , along with the application that the contract has set the contract , the number of pro@@ positions and the straight sentence . the speaker ID is equivalent to the column ID on the box card . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series you can be selected in the order , which is selected in the list below , procedure , or return . ( but not every order consists of several sent@@ ences ) . &quot;
&quot; with one click on OK , all changes of settings ( also on the other cart@@ on cards ) and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is reduced to the icon in the system section . click on this icon to view the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the sound@@ system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead of AL@@ SA , G@@ Stream@@ er or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the map card audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; here are only text attri@@ butes and manages . issues of Screen reproduction , war@@ nings and messages are not displayed . more information about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in . &quot;
&quot; select here the type of audio output . if a component can not be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either without support for the appropriate audi@@ om@@ os module , or &amp; kt@@ ts ; can not load the necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de should be used for audio output , select here the audio output . if there is no output modules in the list , you need to install at least one module . have you select the PC@@ M device . see also
&quot; put the intercom speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % is equivalent to approximately half and 200@@ 3L , % approximately the double normal intercom speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be installed . &quot;
click on users to take the new settings for the current &amp; amp ; -@@ System to take over .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are decorated in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find which equipment works with you . in doubt you choose standard .
&quot; on this map menu , you can set special actions that will always be executed when the text is inter@@ rupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processed four types of translations . &quot;
the issue of screen reproduction has the highest priority . it will be held all other orders and keeps these orders on . after the output of the screen reader will be read again .
war@@ nings have the nearest priority . this stage is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is to be hot reserved . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will continue to be continued after the announcement of the warning .
&quot; News have the next priority . a message under@@ breaks normal text . &amp; km@@ outh ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you &amp; eg ; straight a long text on a website , you can welcome someone over the room . &quot;
&quot; a text addition is inter@@ rupted by a message , warning or output of a screen Reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output will add into the queue . &quot;
this audi@@ od@@ at@@ ei will always be played when a normal text@@ book is inter@@ rupted . if both single sound is active as well as introduc@@ tory message is the introduc@@ tory sound before the introduc@@ tory message .
&quot; the settings on this map are only valid for normal text applications . for news , war@@ nings and issues of screen reel , there are no special promotions , if this is inter@@ rupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to leave with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ Noti@@ fy news , start tr@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and click on notifications . the map @-@ card al@@ erts appears . &quot;
highlight this approach to turn the business from &amp; KDE ; as dis@@ advantage . this setting is not marked , the other settings are de@@ activated and kt@@ ts ; does not read al@@ erts . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , notifications are played when a sound is played , of &amp; kt@@ ts ; not pre@@ read . &quot;

&quot; the Speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark the control of voices , the speaker speed , the volume , the voice of the voice and the sound height . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard . &quot;
currently In@@ kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML are only partly and only in basic functions . following restrictions are available :
&quot; you must install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) , as this is the default , the festival will be used in the output of SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or tape shop will not be set to 100@@ wearing , the SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ ot@@ on . &quot;

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and scrat@@ ches @-@ recogni@@ zing filter ( SD@@ B @-@ Filter ) . SB@@ Ds sub@@ sections text in single phr@@ ases . thus , you can also start the first set of syn@@ thesi@@ zed or res@@ etting up or break up , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer is not directly supported . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the s@@ atz@@ bound@@ ary filter . during the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is automatically set up as a pro@@ posi@@ tional treat@@ able filter . you can change its settings or add another S@@ atz@@ bound@@ ary filter , but it will be retri@@ eved . &quot;
&quot; most easily , you will learn the establishment of the inter@@ iors , and give text to the product . check out the box selection , which spok@@ es@@ man , change some properties and check out how the selection of the intercom function , you must of course have more than a speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; then faster with the start of start , since only the first sentence has to be processed and not the whole text block what can last long , &quot;
you can stop orders on the Kart@@ ei@@ card orders or vom@@ iting , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer this function is not supported . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons the normal S@@ atz@@ bound@@ ary filter will automatically set up , if you boot up for the first time . it cannot be swit@@ ched , just removed . do not change anything on this filter , unless you know what you do . &quot;
S@@ atz@@ unlimited filter@@ ing filter compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ posi@@ tional and add a tab@@ ular sign ( deci@@ mal code 8 ) to the stat@@ utes ( deci@@ mal code ) before filter@@ ing is automatically re@@ tained .
SB@@ D @-@ Filter will never be applied to &amp; KDE ; -@@ News ( kn@@ oti@@ fy ) , war@@ nings , messages or the output of screen reel . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed from verses the normal S@@ atz@@ bound@@ ary filter , you can insert it again by adding the standard _ sb@@ dr@@ c . &quot;
&quot; on the map @-@ menu , you can write the speaker settings for the application . the kart@@ ing card is shown , &quot;
use of the standard machine ( the top of the card @-@ card speaker ) . in other words : there are no inter@@ depend@@ encies .
&quot; use of the appropriate tool , which features all the properties of a furnished intercom devices . if you choose the settings of the tool . if you choose the settings of the intercom , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; this speaker will elect ; the spok@@ es@@ man that originally introduced the original properties . &quot;
select the method to insert the desired effect by clicking on one of the buttons .
&quot; select the properties of the required tool . if this property does not play a role , do not give anything one . &quot;
select this cru@@ ise field when the property is intended to have pre@@ ference over other qualities . you can also set multiple mark@@ ings here .
&quot; as the language is a critical factor when understanding the issue is , this is always considered as a sen@@ ior property . you will always use this property . the only case when you may know the attribute language , if you know that a certain application text is sent in another language than that in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all properties in the field of spok@@ es@@ man , which is to be clear to the following her@@ ein , click on the drop@@ down standard speaker and then use on spok@@ es@@ tion that corresponds to the following document . &quot;
in this case there is currently 0 for the last text yield in queue . you can also specify a contract number . ( no order number is required 0 required ) .

I loaded an extra voice for the festival from the internet . I installed it and can use them in festival but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not show this voice .
&quot; add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / festiv@@ al@@ int / voices the new voice . if this is successful , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL ; where you have found the voice to the developer . &quot;

&quot; the settings for the intercom speed is ignor@@ ed if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; it is connected to the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; after &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are very cour@@ age@@ ous , change the .x@@ sl file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML @-@ capsule filter , and set out the intercom speed . &quot;
I make it not that web pages have read it with a female voice . I have a female festival speaker but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice .

&quot; I have added a own string qu@@ eries filter and now I can go into &amp; kt@@ ts ; no longer put forward , the order is just out of one set . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; p@@ unc@@ tu@@ ation marks ( point , land@@ mark , character and semi@@ col@@ on ) you are not allowed to filter . use for this sign instead a filter for scrat@@ ches recognition . &quot;

&quot; some users experience in conjunction with AL@@ SA conflicts in the audio output . if your system also matters , you can do not simultaneously play music and start a text for this problem . &amp; # in addition , if you have a text supplement and then launch another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) . &quot;
&quot; with Stand of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ d does not support real breaks . if you have a text supplement in &amp; kt@@ ts ; hold , the current set is still read yet . &quot;
the audio program so@@ x is used for general setting of the intercom speed but is otherwise not mandatory . Debian users can so@@ x install with the command ap@@ t @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is already included on most &amp; Linux ; CDs already included .
&quot; download &amp; kt@@ ts ; as t@@ arb@@ all ( with tar b@@ aked archive ) , sign up as usual users and un@@ zip the t@@ arb@@ all into a proper folder . switch to this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;
&quot; in &amp; KDE ; 4 , the module &amp; arts , is probably removed or at least only on request . &quot;
the following modules for voice syn@@ thesizer are created by default . ( non @-@ free according to the direc@@ tives of the Debian distribution ) . the column configure option to switch off the item displays the configure parameter to which the over@@ head of the date .

&quot; before you use , check out whether your language syn@@ thesizer work correctly . follow the instructions that you get with the syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer , its source code is generally well , and there are several voices and languages supported by many voices you can adjust volume , intercom speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
you must install at least one language . help in the instructions that are supplied with festival . want to install websites to you you need to install websites ( male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone .
&quot; for these voices you have to comp@@ ile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . German voices are subject to restrictions on passing . &quot;
this voice continues Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or newer . the voice is still in an early development stage . un@@ zip the software in festival / lib / voices / rus@@ sian / . if you enter the Russian voices _ ru _ ns@@ h _ di@@ phone . select a k@@ yr@@ ill@@ ic ( 8 @-@ bit@@ - ) co@@ ding like for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . search for the festival as first to the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the option must be co@@ ding to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the option must be co@@ ding to a 8 @-@ bit k@@ yr@@ ill@@ as such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; Syn@@ thesizer . then Festival the lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; allows for the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ votes can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete language system . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generated language from Di@@ ph@@ on files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . Festival produces this from &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required Di@@ ph@@ one@@ . t@@ xt@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also create from German texts Di@@ phone .
&quot; in this procedure , additional w@@ rap@@ per code may be added to Festival , to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voice to voice syn@@ ths , but in the folder Festival / lib / . instructions can be found at &quot;
&quot; IM@@ S German Festival is an alter@@ ed version of Festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices . required is either Festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first , install Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival &quot;
&quot; you will find instructions in the RE@@ ADM@@ E package which you have downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 , the settings of the bug@@ fixes is not necessary ) . add the following lines to the file festival / lib / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .s@@ cm . &quot;

&quot; on some systems you need to edit the file / etc / festiv@@ al.@@ s@@ cm . add the right path to your installed German voices . replace the right path to / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / . at the time of creating this manual function , the German de@@ 4 , de@@ 5 , or de@@ 6 voices do not work with IM@@ S German Festival . &quot;
&quot; this method uses special code to express the language via Festival with a Czech &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and make sure that both work and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and ensure that both work . then load festival @-@ Czech &quot;
extract the program with tar in a suitable folder and create the Lexic@@ on . the exec@@ utable file Festival must lie in your P@@ AT@@ H .

&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener language syn@@ thesizer , who has been written in &amp; Java ; i.e. you need to install the &amp; Java ; virtual machine on your system . &quot;
the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any language syn@@ thesizer found in a &amp; console ; in the command line .
&quot; best use a command to send the language issue into a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) , instead of sending the output directly to the audi@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; c@@ network@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; &apos; control@@ center ; to enable the management of the network interface , the routine and DNS settings . &quot;
the &amp; &apos; control@@ center ; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings on a uniform , integrated interface . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ ings@@ conf ; package was developed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; c@@ lock@@ center ; create an easy interface for the following tasks :
after installation there will be a new module network settings in the &amp; cold center ; display . the module network settings ( c@@ network@@ conf ; ) can be started by selection of c@@ control@@ center ; Internet and network settings in the &amp; k@@ menu .
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; c@@ network@@ conf ; network hardware is not able to install . physical equipment and their drivers must already fully functional and configured , so that the device is optim@@ ised and the setting of the network properties . &quot;
&quot; in most cases driver for the network hardware and other devices are installed in Inst@@ all of &amp; Linux , with installed and furnished . network devices have been added later , the driver must be loaded with modification of the following files , according to the core version , are loaded : &quot;
the module network settings will be loaded when the option networking settings in the &amp; c@@ control@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected to automatically det@@ ect the platform used by the system .
&quot; if the platform can not be det@@ ected , the suspension choice is offered . it is the platform from the list that the distribution and the rel@@ eas@@ ant is best corresponding to setting the setting out . the next start of the network settings will then be automatically set . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is possible only in the system administration mode . previously , all options are displayed , what does , the settings can only be considered . in the system administration mode , you can click on the right bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password . &quot;
in the system administration mode the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three riders :
the tab network interface serves to manage the network devices of the system . all available networking equipment are displayed . from the tab network units can be done by the following tasks :
the settings displayed by the desired device can set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button ... in the dialog device .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the dialog with advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; with the selection Automatic will be fet@@ ched the TCP / IP settings from a D@@ HC@@ P server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . the DH@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP @-@ Server will send all the required TCP / IP information with each system start , therefore no further adjustment is required . in the output list may be selected either D@@ HC@@ P or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system . &quot;
with the selection manuals can be performed without D@@ HC@@ P or BO@@ O@@ TP . the IP address must be specified in the input field . in the input field of the input field .
&quot; this setting is marked , initi@@ ali@@ zes the system the network interface at the boats . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values in this dialog are indicated as the properties of the device in the device box .
&quot; it should be assured that the IP address is not already used in the network . the entry of an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping at the &amp; console , you can determine whether the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network should be asked . &quot;
networking equipment can be activated depending on your needs or swit@@ ched . off @-@ off network is done by selecting from the list and clicking the interface ....
networking equipment can be activated depending on your needs or swit@@ ched . off an activated network is done by selecting from the list and clicking the interface ....
&quot; speci@@ fies the IP address of the computer in the local sub@@ net , which provides the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ networks . &quot;
&quot; if the computer is more than a network interface , the interface must be selected to the network , where the gateway computer is to be selected . &quot;
a computer with DNS support is replaced by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computer only need IP addresses . if the computer is only IP @-@ addresses you delete this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 45.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the machine for the name resol@@ utions part of the emp@@ ire name allows an easy handling of this list . entries may be added , removed or alter@@ .@@ DNS entries can be put up or down in the list with the buttons or down in the priority . &quot;
clicking the button Add ... from the group computer to insert a DNS server can be added to a DNS server . it will be added to the dialog New Nam@@ eser@@ ver .
&quot; first , you must enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button Add . the entry is then inser@@ ted in the list . &quot;
from the group calcul@@ ator to nam@@ esp@@ ace you choose an entry and then click the button Edit .... It will be shown the dialog .
the list also known as well @-@ known calcul@@ ator pro@@ claim @-@ to @-@ IP address for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily on boot@@ ing if no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks you can replace DNS @-@ Server . &quot;
&quot; usually , the list also known as well known as some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; local@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses are supported . these still in the test can be replaced in the future version 4 . &quot;
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add .... The dialog of Die Neue Ali@@ as is shown .
&quot; enter the name of the known computer and click Add to add the button . if the famous computer has several ali@@ ases , then kno@@ b Add several times and enter the other ali@@ ases name . &quot;
select an entry of a well known invo@@ ices from the list and select Edit .... The dialog box will be displayed .
&quot; it can be done one of the following tasks , then click updated by clicking the list of static hosts . &quot;
the settings in the module settings are not immediately effective in the system . to enable the changes to be activated in a console ; the following command must be set .
the home page of &amp; k@@ ings@@ conf ; is http : / / k@@ gmb@@ con@@ f.@@ source@@ forge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of bin@@ ary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm @-@ packages ) it ranges when &amp; KDE ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and in a console ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with graphical user interface as a package or the installation tool of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; for this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; KDE ; not , but in addition the development packages are required with libraries and other things . &quot;
this is recommended only experienced users . it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ ings@@ conf ; to comp@@ ile . the following commands should do this .
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic networks technology , in the second will all be discussed by &amp; c@@ network@@ conf ; modified configuration files . &quot;
this section can not replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this Appendi@@ x only basic information on the integration of the PCs into a small ( home ) network .
&quot; pres@@ ently , IP @-@ networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found great spread . from IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . this description is therefore focused on the spread IP@@ v@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; one of the most important information is the knowledge , which IP address is provided by network interface . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; workplace is the network administrator to be given or if available , D@@ HC@@ P can not be used easily . in any case the IP address can be simply selected . &quot;
&quot; if using a very own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specially designed for this purpose to avoid IP address . the addresses from the table below are not communic@@ ated in the Internet , therefore any use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the internet for such machines can be made by setting up a gat@@ ew@@ ays . &quot;
for smaller networks are usually used addresses in the range of 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large for networks up to 250 calcul@@ ator .
&quot; in addition , the net@@ m@@ ask usually becomes on 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so all calcul@@ ators are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ 01 ; .0.@@ 0 and 127@@ .0@@ .0.@@ 1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the branches the lo@@ op@@ back @-@ address ( local@@ host = of your own computer ) . &quot;
&quot; 127@@ .0@@ .0.@@ 1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . usually , the address 127@@ .0@@ .0.@@ 1 assigned to its own so called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which is like a closed circle . &quot;
&quot; in this part there are the configuration files that are affected by &amp; c@@ network@@ conf , and where they are fil@@ ed in the different distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; this file will sometimes be dynam@@ ically changed at DSL connections , so that it is not surprised if in the case of active DSL connections to find another content than fixed there . &quot;
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; is known that this file is falling away by the scripts in Su@@ pi config . another stand as expected can therefore occur .

&quot; alternatively , you can click on the task and select the right mouse button on the task and you press Ctr@@ l ; O. It will then edit the dialog box in which you can edit how above , the chosen task can process . &quot;
&quot; to delete a task , select the task . go to the menu item . &quot;
&quot; to enable a task or dis@@ able , select them , and determine the condition with the menu item . in@@ active tasks are marked in their description with in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can also select the task and select the right mouse button on the task and ac@@ tivi@@ sts . make sure you can refer to the activation that program name , parameters and description are correct . &quot;
&quot; to run a task immediately , select this and then go to edit Now . &quot;
&quot; to create a new ambi@@ ent variable , select the variable folder to select the variable folder . go to the menu item . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the variable folder and select New ... select , or press Ctr@@ l ; N . &quot;
enter the variable name of the variable . you can also select one from the list of the most frequently used ambi@@ ent variable ; click on the arrow next to the field for the vari@@ ability names .
to send e @-@ mails from the in@@ adequate program to another than the normal address
&quot; as in creating new variables , changes will only be saved when the c@@ ron@@ tab was saved . &quot;
&quot; to cut a variable , they first select the variable variable . go to edit . &quot;
&quot; to copy an ambi@@ ent variable , first choose to copy the copy variable . go to Edit copy . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the variable and select and press Ctr@@ l ; C . &quot;
&quot; to add an ambi@@ ent variable , first one must be cut into the clip@@ board or have been copied , only then the option is available at all . then select the variable folder . &quot;
&quot; to change a variable , select the first button at the right click on the variable and Select ... or you press Ctr@@ l ; O .@@ There will then edit the dialog variables in which you can edit as above , the variable . &quot;
&quot; to delete an ambi@@ ent variable , first choose the variable . go to Edit . &quot;
&quot; to enable an ambi@@ ent variable or de@@ activated , select them , and place the state with the menu item Edit Activ@@ ates . with a de@@ activated variable will be released under description . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can also select the variable click on the variable and select ac@@ tivi@@ sts . make sure that name and value of variables are correct correctly . &quot;
&quot; if all tasks and ambi@@ ent variables has been given or alter@@ ed , you have to save the c@@ ron@@ tab . select the menu item File Save . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can press Ctr@@ l ; S press changes or supplements to tasks or variables are only then active . &quot;
&quot; it seems to be the default KDE @-@ KDE . if you choose outs , you see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; specific options in print dialog . &quot;
prints the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who own advanced per@@ missions .
cr@@ on for example vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the command c@@ ron@@ tab to change the schedul@@ es of the users .
PO@@ SIX @-@ kon@@ form@@ es &amp; UNIX ; for example with g@@ lib@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands of &amp; UNIX ; to find time and date .
&amp; dat ; is a backup program for band@@ ages on the basis of tar . it offers the opportunity to create multiple archives on a tape , which was the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for quick , sel@@ ective pay@@ outs . the second goal was to answer my wife : how much longer does it take ? &quot;
&quot; before a band can be used , it must be done by &amp; dat ; this can be done in three ways : &quot;
&amp; dat ; sp@@ ake the band back and reads the pre@@ ten@@ sions of the belt . det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat with the band will not be asked if the band is form@@ att@@ ed if the band is form@@ att@@ ed .
&quot; det@@ ects &amp; dat ; the fore@@ fathers , is looking for the appropriate index on your plate . can this not be found if the Band@@ index is new to be created . &quot;
&quot; everything went straight , the symbol for the band@@ width is to indicate that the band has been incorpor@@ ated into the status bar . in the status bar , the content of the Ban@@ des can now be en@@ forced by extension of the entry for the band . &quot;
&quot; before the throw of the belt , first of the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to achieve this : &quot;
&amp; dat ; gives a change the symbol for the band that the integration has been solved for the band and shows in the status bar a corresponding message . the band can now be thro@@ wn out without danger .
&quot; before a band of &amp; k@@ dat , it can be used by &amp; dat . form@@ att@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; a band@@ cards must be form@@ att@@ ed before you must be used for stor@@ ing data . this process does not need to form@@ att@@ ed up data , before you need to form@@ att@@ ed it before using the band from &amp; k@@ dat , form@@ att@@ ed . flo@@ ppy disk drives usually to be form@@ att@@ ed . flo@@ ppy disk drives are usually not to be form@@ att@@ ed . &quot;
after entering the band@@ name and the capacity leaves &amp; k@@ dat with the form@@ att@@ ing of the belt . all data on the tape will be lost ! after completion of the process of the process the band is automatically integrated and is operational .
&quot; before you will str@@ ate your backup process , you have to select the re@@ com@@ fy files . this can be done in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it is only stored this file or folder .
select a backup profile in the tree . there are only the files specified in the profile given files .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the so marked files and / or sub@@ folders are secured .
click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select the menu ...
&quot; once the backup has been initi@@ ated , the dialog opens Settings for backup . in this dialog you can once check the selected files and change the settings for the backup . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog backup will appear . the dialog displays the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the disk . it is only checked the selected file or folder .
select files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a heads . it is only checked the selected files and / or sub@@ folders .
click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu items ....
&quot; once the testing process has been started , the dialog box will be displayed for chec@@ king . in this dialog you can check once your selection and change the processes for chec@@ king . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog will appear over@@ look . this dialog displays the progress of the examination as well as the data throug@@ h@@ put and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can restore the re@@ produce , the files that are to be restored . this can be marked on two types : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the entry line . it is only restored the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the desired files from one of the archives with a tick . there are only the so marked files and / or sub@@ folders .
click with the right mouse button on a file or folder on one of the archives and select Save the menu ....
&quot; once the return process has been started , the dialog box will be released for restoration . in this dialog you can check once your selection and the job@@ d@@ ner will change for restoration . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the recovery , the dialog will be re@@ covering . this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throug@@ h@@ put and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; sometimes it pro@@ ves to create it as necessary to create the band@@ index file using the band content . this process is delet@@ es any existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two kinds of band : &quot;
this will create a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can take the following settings :
the current job@@ sor@@ ers in which the backup is to be made . the list of sec@@ uring files will be updated automatically according to the currently selected work@@ bench automatically .
&quot; for all folders , which are listed under backup files , the files are stored on the same file system as the folder . folder , which are stored on other file systems , you can specify separately under backup files . each entry is independent of tar independent of the others . &quot;
making an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental Backup will have a snapshot file . it only will be the files that have since changed since then .
the name of the file that used to capture changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delet@@ es the snapshot file before the call of tar . this causes all files will be secured and a new snapshot file for the next sec@@ uring is created .
the functionality of buttons files &amp; gt ; and lt ; all the files was not completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings can set you up via the menu option KD@@ at ... in the menu Settings menu . the following settings may take you :
the full path to the device file ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ wind@@ ing variant of the Band@@ ger@@ ät@@ es .
&quot; this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the band is integrated in the drive . with some drives this is necessary , before readers or writing operations . &quot;
&quot; the option is swit@@ ched , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; the throw @-@ out of the band@@ work . maybe this setting does not work with all band stations . &quot;
&quot; the option is swit@@ ched on the w@@ ashes of the integration of &amp; k@@ dat , automatically use the tape . use this option not on flo@@ ppy stream . &quot;
&quot; is the option enabled , tries &amp; k@@ dat to change it . not all drives support variable block@@ ing sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you must inform you in any case the block@@ ing size for your band@@ width . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat , a band form@@ att@@ ed , writes a file to the beginning of the Ban@@ des . this file should only rank@@ ed a storage block on the tape . the contents of the file is composed of : &quot;
&quot; ( n Byte ) The band @-@ ID . the format of this string is calculated : seconds , while the full name of the system is form@@ att@@ ed . seconds is the number of seconds , which has passed since the ep@@ och in which the band has been form@@ att@@ ed . &quot;
the band @-@ ID is used to create a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .k@@ dat / .k@@ .
&quot; the remaining files on the band are pure tar -@@ archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar will work . even other tar -@@ versions should work , as long as it is not an incre@@ mental f@@ uses . &quot;
veri@@ fy the content of a backup name . this symbol is active only when a band is mounted .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; KDE ; -@@ viewing for system prot@@ ocol@@ s . the program is for un@@ experienced users who can not know where you can get information about your system or where the system allows you to get information about problems with the quick access to the information about problems that appear on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer in the background makes it easy to know where you can get information about your system or where you can find information about your system or where the system uses the different protocol files .
&quot; in addition , &amp; system@@ log ; experienced users the quick access to the example of information about problems associated with their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; attempts to provide some more advanced functions with their help the protocol files of certain programs can be filter@@ ed and analys@@ ed . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has co@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful features include :
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of sys@@ log server and for Sam@@ ba . &quot;
many other functions are also included and will be explained in the other chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you can see in the following screen photo , introduces &amp; System@@ system@@ log ; functions are easily filter@@ ed and sort . the individual options for sorting and filter@@ ing will be shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after starting the start &amp; k@@ system@@ log , first tried to open and open the most important protocol @-@ file of the system - the system prot@@ ok@@ oll , so you will not appear with system links , so you will not have a system for@@ ew@@ ing right . the protocol @-@ files are usually not listed in the folder / var / log , for the normal user usually no justi@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar , in order to filter by a selected c@@ rit@@ erion or according to a given string . the list of the log file is now displayed , allowing you to specify a log line in addition to the filter . then a protocol line is only displayed when in one of the columns of the filter system . &quot;
&quot; at this point you can also select another entry . the string of the filter system will then select the column process , and carry out the column process in accordance with the name of a process , and carry out in the filter cover the name of a process , allowing you to send you a system ; all protocol @-@ lines that were sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to det@@ ect the important protocol lines . protocol @-@ lines of the level errors are displayed with a stri@@ king color as a protocol @-@ lines of the level note . the colour display of protocol @-@ lines can be swit@@ ched up in dialog .
&quot; if you only want to display particular process ( e.g. in the system prot@@ ok@@ oll or in the C@@ ron @-@ Protocol ) , so you can examine the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . it can be useful for example , if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case you use filter . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can activate the option for new lines in the context menu of the main window , in order to display all new ad@@ ditions log lines . &quot;
&quot; user @-@ system@@ log ; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub @-@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open additional sub@@ window , select a window to display an protocol for viewing . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on http : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ org@@ . D@@ ort can find further information about the reference of &amp; k@@ system@@ log .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also available in the following folder of the &amp; KDE ; -@@ Subversion Archi@@ ving : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; KDE ; -@@ archive
&quot; welcome to &amp; KDE ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named as &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sys@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the system V In@@ it is rapidly developing towards the control of the program during the system of system in the &amp; Linux ; world . and therefore , because it is easier to use , powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it . &quot;
I will not go on historical aspects here ( e.g. because I know nothing about it : - ) .
&quot; the In@@ it bin@@ ary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important , because maybe someone might try to make a machine to System V In@@ it , without a re@@ installation and re@@ form@@ att@@ ing . therefore , you have to saf@@ est that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one . &quot;
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it is also different from the BSD In@@ it that is the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called rc@@ .d. D@@ ort can be found r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folder :
&quot; you may need a whole lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for each system service that you want to start the system or swit@@ ching to another Run@@ level . system services contain such things such as set@@ serial , which only once started . such Views belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; r@@ c.@@ local should be in turn to / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems possess these file , even if you do not have much use for this . you can also do a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you do not want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you do something to do something with the serial connection . &quot;
the kernel sear@@ ches for various places after the program in@@ it and starts the first that he finds .
the default Run@@ level is in / etc / init@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably notice that the for@@ ged Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it / etc / init@@ tab from hand and change the 3 . be very careful when you start your system and exec@@ ute it :
&quot; but how does it start all the scripts ? if you enter the right scripts ? if you enter into rc@@ 3.@@ d , then you will probably see something like the following : &quot;
you will notice that you do not find the right files in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the script in the directory in@@ it.@@ d . &quot;
&quot; how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written , that there is an argument like start and stop . you can start this scripts by hand on the command line : &quot;
&quot; this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one K includes , the script will be called with the argument stop . if he includes a S , the script will start with the argument start . &quot;
&quot; some people want to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have &amp; eg ; a server -@@ Run@@ level , which can only be htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; run . furthermore , network &amp; etc ; starts . &quot;
here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was so user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; with a mouse or another period is easy to say to say tri@@ vi@@ al : just drag an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six Run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
&quot; you can also shift between Run@@ ners , or change the position within a levels by doing it elsewhere . this will only be taken from its original Run@@ level ( or its position ) . this happens only then , if they turn out an entry from the area of available system services . &quot;
&quot; note : entries are post@@ pon@@ ed if you choose these into a new zone . in order to insert it to a new Run@@ level , you have to select a new level menu and paste into the target area -- even then , if the same entry has already exists in the target area of the action . &quot;
the sorting number of a item can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case you need to edit the sorting numbers of the envelop@@ ing entries before you try again to insert the system service .
&quot; note : there is no possibility to restore entries that have been thro@@ wn into the tr@@ ash . be so careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the tab@@ ulator button to enable the different work areas ( Available system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to hit a selection of above or below the previous ones . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry into another Run@@ level , move it to cut into the clip@@ board ( you can also Ctr@@ l ; X use ) and add it into the desired level level with paste ( with Ctr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sorting number or the name of a contract to change , press the tab@@ ulator button to change the properties file to accept the properties button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to make the changes . &quot;
due to the risk of the data base require all entries in the menu File require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ svr@@ c . pre@@ ferences will be available in the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DIR ) / config / config / k@@ sy@@ svr@@ c ) if it is available from &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; restore changes to pre@@ ferences are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ svr@@ c .
&quot; I have been experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ ners , and now the machine is ste@@ adily available . what can I do ? &quot;
enter at LI@@ LO -@@ Promp@@ t linux single and press the input button to start in individual mode . then edit the file / etc / init@@ tab and change the default level at a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be in order ) .
&quot; I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; for version under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distribution . please read the details in the manual of the distribution . &quot;
&quot; the way , such as system services can be started in these distri@@ butions , but does not simpli@@ fy the configuration of the propri@@ etary applications of this distri@@ butions , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you use any other distribution : please check whether any configuration files are required , which are required by the respective system service ( and also whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( like &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) just does not end any message if their configuration files are not available or wrong . &quot;
&quot; the importance of &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be used from version to version . if you use any other distribution please send me information about the Run@@ level , so that this manual can be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to begin with &amp; k@@ user , it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; &quot;
&quot; after you made changes , you have to save this . either you will use the relevant icon of the tool@@ bar or the entry stor@@ ing in the menu File . &quot;
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two boxes cards , the user interface and the user interface . to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double @-@ click on the entry . &quot;
&quot; some cart@@ on cards are only shown , if you have extended system settings . only if you want to have extended settings , will be displayed on which you can use individual settings , if shadow -@@ pass@@ words or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as in BSD @-@ Uni@@ x@@ en . &quot;
the cardboard boxes will be released if Shadow pass@@ words or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as are installed in BSD -@@ Uni@@ x@@ en .
this cart@@ on will appear only if for at least a built @-@ in fil@@ es@@ ystem ground@@ ing ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ ali@@ zes ( recogni@@ z@@ able at the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the fil@@ es@@ ystem ) . here you can change each user parameters in the file :
these parameters can be configured separately for each fil@@ es@@ ystem . the current file system is selected with the help of the field system .
&quot; the map groups provides information about the group of the selected user . the standard group , to which the user is part of the user , you will find in the field primary group . furthermore the user can mark in other groups by placing them in the big field . &quot;
&quot; the dialog features of the group includes a list of users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or a group , select Add from the menu user or group or click the appropriate install button of the tool@@ bar . the edit or delete the selected user or the selected group works analog . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can install the LI@@ LO @-@ Boot@@ manager , remove the bo@@ ads , remove and change the time to the boot@@ ing of the standard systems , remove the standard systems , remove OS , change , change and more . &quot;
