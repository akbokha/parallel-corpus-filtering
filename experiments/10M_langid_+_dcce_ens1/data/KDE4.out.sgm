<seg id="416">The neo-filter simulates neo-light to the contrasts. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sliding repetitions the strength of the neural. in large images the filter can arrange the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon to correct the shades of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors. as soon as you are satisfied with the result you are using the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">"if you make a photo with bad light relationships, you can also get a good choice for brightness / saturation rather than raise it. all changes you can do in the preview. when you look at the result you can confirm the changes with Ok."</seg>

<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for a sharpness. it is very fast and simple, but creates especially in dark areas, granular pictures."</seg>
<seg id="481">"Unsharpness-Mask works on the contrast of the cantist for a picture of sharpening. actually, it is not a bit more psychovisually. you can use it to be atmospheric gst and it makes it a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang."</seg>
<seg id="482">"Refecussians may be the best of the three, as he really improves the sharpness. he is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt."</seg>
<seg id="483">"photos without focus, as well as most digitalized images need a correction of sharpness. this is that the same phenomenon can be combined with only minimal differences to a colour point. the same phenomenon can also be printed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras can normally be printed as a normal cameras for the private use."</seg>
<seg id="484">"in JPEG-Pictures, a camera is often applied in internal sharpness. pictures in the size format, on the contrary, you must always be sharpened during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanner turn into a sharpness filter already during the reading of the image. if you deactivate this deactivate, you get the control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can receive results by using a photo with the shooting range. this allows you to call it with the menu items.</seg>
<seg id="487">"but you should not be careful, as the results are not very natural: the sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also strengthening the smokers. in general, you can find out more information about the menu of reflection. you can find more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpness."</seg>
<seg id="488">"sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution, the picture is a little soft to paint, is much easier than to sharpened it. use the tool for softener corks and experiment something with settings. the showcase on the right side of the dialogue shows you the effect on your photo."</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter blurred masking is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration you can see here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview help the image to edit. the showcase shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and amount. the standard values are common good results and should go first. an increase in radius or the operator will strengthen the effect. if you create the unsharpening mask. if you create the unsharpening mask, will create space and get the impression of grats near sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius poses a how many pixels on each side of a edge through the filter are affected. high-resolution images allow greater radii. you should therefore take pictures at the best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage of the original and the padded image of the original one that is added to the original. thus the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The sponge is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference. one can thus define a minimal difference thus for a cure of the filter. in this way areas with a soft change between the tones of sharpening and therefore flaw in faces.</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the unsharp masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image the (2). unsharp masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a sponge = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & D came; tool Refecussians refused a picture by improving the sharpness. it used by copyright protected filters to Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">"this tool tries to get a picture to & quot; refocussians. this is better approach as a few trying to sharpening the photo called FIR Wiener Filtration. it can usually run a technique called FIR Wiener filtration."</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice the circular folding is much better than the Gauß 'sche folding. the Gauß' sche Faltung has a very long tail, which causes the mathematical outcome also from the original pixel pixel. the FIR Wiener Inverse of the Gauß's folding will depend on most cases even very strongly influenced by the original pixel. it causes unwanted results."</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. you can set a higher value when your image should look very blurred but then in Heiligenstadt.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in the correlation can help reduce the correlation can be chosen by 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0,99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpness effect of the module. "</seg>
<seg id="501">"smoking filters: an increase in the room filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, the filter can decrease values of 0-1. however, values can be values of 0-1. however, values are higher than 0.1. however, the image quality is very bad. a usable value is 0.03. a high value will still be wasted."</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauß's sharpness: this is the radius for the palate's sharpness. use this parameter to avoid unsharpened filter. in most cases, you should not use this value on 0 to avoid angry artefacts, you might also have to increase the correlation and / oderAbate filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"mature size: this value determines the size of transformation smatrix. an increase in the mat size can have good results, especially if you choose large values for the circular sharpness or the palate's shot. in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">Storing as and charging buttons are used exactly for this purpose. anyone any reflecting parameters have set the you will be saved for later and can then be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try all the cutting edge, color and intensity and intensity on the picture before you use the module. "</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that a lot of operations changes not immediately visible are not immediately visible but later unpleasant artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">"if you want to read and compress, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed picture."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, sharp cusing better results as sharpness. this could be causing this, the unsharp mascot is used as a sharpness."</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically speaking mascot must always produce artifacts. even under optimal conditions it can always show the effect of the unsharpening. even under optimal conditions it can always show the effect of the FIR Wiener Filters. convenient is the result of FIR Wiener Filters. convenient is the result of the FIR Wiener Filters. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better in the processing of small details.</seg>

<seg id="521">"smoothly [0, 500]: this puts the maximum smoothing factor above all. then put this value therefore suitable to the degree of space in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter is set to greater structures. the higher this value is set, the more is necessary to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh'Turbulences effect, it must be higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repeatings: returns to how often the algorithm is going through. usually here 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle gradual da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is small, you should also choose a long term. consider that little corner should be chosen for a long term. you should also choose this value as much as possible and for your needs."</seg>

<seg id="1520">'--preset medium' = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">"--preset standard '= This setting should usually provide transparency for most people and most of musicians accept transparency, and has quite high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex musicians and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice."</seg>
<seg id="1523">"--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. always takes 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a Title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1524">"-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate approximately 11 128 kbps for all pieces of young people, portable devices and Autostereotypes. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"the & CD; information that are manually entered or controlled by the program automatically, are available as a list of parameters. you can be given / used with & kaudiocreator; and the encoding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of music files."</seg>
<seg id="1527">"in connection with a encoding programs, there is often a combination of programming orders for the codifiers and these parameters here. the manual or the help of the encoders explain the switches for these programs."</seg>
<seg id="1528">"e.g. to add the & CD; title to the keywords (English: day) to add MP3s with lame, the switch is removed from lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator; the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'."</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters used to be used (= Knopfuses in Assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">"this is what the drivethearb is: a free database, in the person you can download the audio CDs, so that all of the information you can download in the computer: & CD; title, artist, names of pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"yes, it should be legal, but I am not lawyer, but I am not lawyer. however, nobody can prevent the author of the & CD; nothing or less worthless, so the information can be attached to the music or less; but all the information can be attached to the music or less; business, physical or virtual."</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; an anti-mail address is used as which can be used in a system with another (fake) address as which cannot be used in the system. in this type of configuration, it appears, the e-mail address will not be used by the server (this can only know the programmer.) "</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there are available in many countries copies of the main database. if & kaudiocreator; for the use of drivethearb, the geographical coverage is to be used in the next placement server. this saves a range of network and slides the load between the computers."</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to Apprecik.provides a current list of mirrors for the online retrieval of & CD; information during the reading of a & CD; or alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually monthly) only the updates of the database. "</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which execute program is used to save pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia is used; if you want to know more accurately in source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio-CD; see that the cdparanoia package has to be installed when this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"for storing the selected WAV files can be selected for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGD), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a verlustfree compression for audio data) on the tab. other cooter can be added to this tab."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The coerer package must be installed by the Linux distribution before the code. this is also required for predefined codifiers. more information about Kodifier can be found in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a code you can get more information about his switch as lame -help or lame --help in a consoles. it must be replaced by the name of the installed encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1540">"that can have many causes. check out the device of the device recording of the & CD; / DVD drives, and whether both cdparanoia and your choice (lame for MP3s, ogrc for OGGs, flac & etc;). try to give both programs using a command line in a terminal. this could be an indication of what is wrong."</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want to read a copy audio CD; check out the cover of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">"there is a chapter with a step by step examples. even if you use other settings, this can give tips as you have to move."</seg>

<seg id="1545">"there must be cdparanoia and lame already available on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled package for your Linux distribution, as it is not necessary to compile the source files as it is not necessary to compile the source files, what you can of course always do."</seg>

<seg id="1547">The first section covers the fundamental set-up of & kaudiocreator; something which will probably be done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure for reading a & CD; what has to be repeated for each out & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1549">"here we define the codifiers to compressing the music (lame) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). it will be determined where the files are stored, we share the program with, the order to use the & CD; data from the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="1550">"although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change it with any reading of a & CD; if once the suitable settings are found."</seg>

<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for individual comments inidically per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments who are common for all the pieces of the CD. "</seg>
<seg id="1587">"Attention: after the successful retrieval of the data from the drivethearb, the CD-Editor is not empty, but it already contains a good idea to start the content of the CD editor. however, it is always a good idea to begin with the artist and album name (such as if all words with letters letter or not...), but also to consider whether there are any unwanted notes."</seg>
<seg id="1588">"note: in this example we use only ID3v1 tags. this is limited the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and at only 28 characters for the commentary box. this option allows you to adjust a look at the tab, you can take a look at the section 'basic settings'."</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later at any time with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>

<seg id="1665">"please note that here with the term Drum patch of patch is meant to include any other percussionist instrument (Drum, pelvis, Maracas & etc;) and not the one that means the tone the sound height of the same Drum (like him some keyboards)."</seg>

<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section the sequence of lines is very important, as their presence. you have to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use several names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to form notes on the percussions. look at the example the supplied Keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to form some channels on other ones. if you want to complete the first and second channel, make it simply in the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards that have percussion on a particular channel (General MIDI to channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"Midi devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following samples:"</seg>

<seg id="1674">The option ForcePatch can be useful for example to always use the percussions patch on the percussions.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderRatio will be multiplied, in which relationship Pitch-bender events will be converted with the value n, this will be converted with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then be passed on. the value 4096 is not used to be missing in the map file."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM will present a keyboard, that is a Pitch-Bender event, with the value 4096, a tone higher than to play. unfortunately, some keyboards need to play higher than a octave higher. to try to get the correct value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI-Map, simply open the dialog MIDI settings."</seg>
<seg id="1678">The laptops is a window with a full range of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you can see which sounds exactly played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel, to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a selector list where you can choose an instrument, enlightens the button no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used."</seg>

<seg id="1681">"the pace-LCD shows the speed at, with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"so you can change the pace of a song. if you find example, a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow down the pace, use the arrows left and right of the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a piece of piece must be played, it contains the notes, the rhythm, the speed, and etc;. thus, the same MIDI file can lead to very different results, as well as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"well, I cannot force anybody, & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while a mp3 file you need a similar sound quality. in a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc; they have control over everything."</seg>

<seg id="2956">"welcome to & KDE; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the system V Init is rapidly developing towards the control of the program during the system of system in the & Linux; world. and therefore, because it is easier to use, powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD -Init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go on historical aspects here (e.g. because I know nothing about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the Init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important, because maybe someone might try to make a machine to System V Init, without a reinstallation and reformatting. therefore, you have to safest that the old Init was removed from there if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init is also different from the BSD Init that is the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort can be found rc.sysinit and the following additional folder:</seg>
<seg id="2961">"you may need a whole lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for each system service that you want to start the system or switching to another Runlevel. system services contain such things such as setserial, which only once started. such Views belong to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"rc.local should be in turn to / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems possess these file, even if you do not have much use for this. you can also do a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d, if you do not want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d, if you do something to do something with the serial connection."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches for various places after the program init and starts the first that he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default Runlevel is in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look into the second column and probably notice that the forged Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it / etc / inittab from hand and change the 3. be very careful when you start your system and execute it:</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the scripts? if you enter the right scripts? if you enter into rc3.d, then you will probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that you do not find the right files in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to one of the script in the directory init.d. "</seg>
<seg id="2968">"how to start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written, that there is an argument like start and stop. you can start this scripts by hand on the command line:"</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one K includes, the script will be called with the argument stop. if he includes a S, the script will start with the argument start."</seg>

<seg id="2971">Here you learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was so user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another period is easy to say to say trivial: just drag an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six Runlevel to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">"you can also shift between Runners, or change the position within a levels by doing it elsewhere. this will only be taken from its original Runlevel (or its position). this happens only then, if they turn out an entry from the area of available system services."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are postponed if you choose these into a new zone. in order to insert it to a new Runlevel, you have to select a new level menu and paste into the target area -- even then, if the same entry has already exists in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of a item can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case you need to edit the sorting numbers of the enveloping entries before you try again to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: there is no possibility to restore entries that have been thrown into the trash. be so careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tabulator button to enable the different work areas (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to hit a selection of above or below the previous ones."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry into another Runlevel, move it to cut into the clipboard (you can also Ctrl; X use) and add it into the desired level level with paste (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorting number or the name of a contract to change, press the tabulator button to change the properties file to accept the properties button to accept the changes, or press Esc to make the changes."</seg>
