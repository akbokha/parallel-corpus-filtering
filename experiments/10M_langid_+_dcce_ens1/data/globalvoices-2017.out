&quot; although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extremely big .
&quot; as many of my generation I grew up with American films , have been agreed to American music , American authors have read and operated his sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had a great pro@@ found effect on me that I was mainly because of a American film journ@@ alist . &quot;
&quot; when 14 years old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , like he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican cover , a fear@@ less repor@@ ter , who covered with the help of Julia Roberts as a Jura co@@ ed of a oil @-@ magn@@ itude with judges that had its interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free to Method Man , &quot; I was , as if that the absolute truth is , Ver@@ gis@@ s everything else , that is what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year , which I lived in Arizona , had my ad@@ mir@@ ation for the US only . &quot;
&quot; I always said : &quot; &quot; America is the only country where I have ever lived , whose variety is so welcoming , that you are always the way you are , and it is easy to find acceptance within a community of simult@@ aneous people . &quot;
I even had a very angry love about his size .
then Donald Tru@@ mp came .
much was written about the x@@ en@@ op@@ hobia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his asc@@ ension is for me as he goes with his commitment .
he never hold of his mind behind the mountain as you say so beautiful .
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks , like a former colle@@ ague , and explained in public@@ ly his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , A@@ fro@@ am@@ eri@@ ans and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people have respon@@ ded to his statements and tun@@ ed for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million voices , which he won during the republi@@ can pre @-@ elections , was the highest number that was issued by the party nomin@@ ate candidate . &quot;
I was speech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans who support this big@@ gr@@ otto , I asked myself ? &quot;
I could not get Tru@@ mp and his vot@@ ers not with people in harmony that I had to know during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; as for example my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alist program , the people coming from all over the world , a deeply smooth man , with whom I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; also part of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ in@@ nati In@@ quir@@ er &quot; &quot; published by Peter Bh@@ atia , the current publisher of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ in@@ nati In@@ quir@@ er &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bh@@ atia and I met with our shared love for basketball , and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix &quot; &quot; at the game . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mps int@@ oler@@ ance is also in contrast to gener@@ osity , which I lived on Sandy B@@ ahr , who fought for their lives for the environment and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like their son . &quot;
&quot; nor does it fit to the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped with much patience and grace from me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of the American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew L@@ eck@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors whose favorite advice has helped me a lot with my career . &quot;
these people and those by them em@@ bodi@@ ly values deep@@ ened my love for America .
&quot; while Tru@@ mp its way to nomin@@ ee Republi@@ can pres@@ idential dates , it offered me a stop and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America . &quot;
yet it turned out to be that they were the exception of the rule .
&quot; on 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans , mostly grain , the pres@@ idency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of its cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the examination of the idea that people have agreed to Tru@@ mp , because they either agreed to his rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism or because they were ready to over@@ look these things almost the heart . &quot;
maybe it is un@@ fair the Tru@@ mp @-@ vot@@ ers to be described as r@@ acy .
&quot; the human beings , said one of my friends , is exactly what has led us to this situation . &quot;
this is superf@@ ici@@ ally and respect@@ ful and indicates a dis@@ ability to understand those who act in a different way and think .
it shows the people that their concerns and f@@ ears about the h@@ ec@@ tic changes in their communities are not considered .
&quot; could it be that these vot@@ ers , of which most white are , for Tru@@ mp tun@@ ed because they want to win control over a country that she has disappointed ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might want to say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , one can barely forget the words of David Rem@@ n@@ ick that looks the cru@@ el decision to raise a man who looks different with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look different . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; &quot; whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; ( An@@ . . . . : as much as &quot; &quot; dis@@ agreement of the past@@ ures against all other eth@@ nia ; &quot; &quot; words from white in reference to the wh@@ ites and Whi@@ pl@@ ash , what is the great Van Jones now@@ here , has just the killed what America has made so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world value the American Ideal - regardless of whether my@@ th or reality , it is still a powerful idea - what faith or background one may have always like that America is always welcome . &quot;
&quot; for this country is chosen as his president , twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ an@@ ers whose history , as he himself says , now@@ here else in the world would be possible . &quot;
but with the election Donald Tru@@ mps but there is a huge part of the white Americ@@ as this promise and says : to hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back on the rod , they say . &quot;
&quot; in all that I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldiers who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the evening of the election . &quot;
on a cli@@ ent@@ ness of Hill@@ ary Clinton Mr. Khan had a wor@@ ding change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , would have my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
the crowd rep@@ lied with a ste@@ ady &quot; no ! &quot;
&quot; would you have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; missing the crowd . &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; answered them . &quot;
did A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they were and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; would anyone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received an un@@ anim@@ ous and accor@@ ding@@ strong &quot; NO . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Khan closed with the words : &quot; God is thanks , Mr. Tru@@ mp , this is not your America . &quot;
&quot; the land , for which his son was fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tru@@ mps land , said the message . &quot;
and all people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find a place in this new America . &quot;
and it breaks me my heart .

what did the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero Community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ic city of Cat@@ eur@@ a ?
&quot; that the music that is played in both places , not only the life of children has changed , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large g@@ arb@@ age dump , just 16 kilometers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old col@@ onial city which is very popular among tourists but worlds from nearby pre@@ col@@ onial ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for several years now , La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) is now playing in the community : one of children and adults of existing symp@@ hon@@ y orchestra , which has found a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments . &quot;
a music school with 100 students is for the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca to the central interest .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the municipality , which is located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mex@@ ik@@ os , is known for its drugs abuse and the ban@@ den violence . &quot;
&quot; however , this changed after an acci@@ dental encounter with a French pil@@ ots who started a musical project and the youth so a rare hopes . &quot;
the young band members take their obligations against music group very seriously , means the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI : &quot;
once they come from school they walk back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty roads to follow their great passion .
&quot; they always come and play with gloss@@ y eyes and play in the tro@@ bel you learn day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clarinet , ob@@ oe , flute , forest , Pau@@ ke , B@@ ong@@ os and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from g@@ arb@@ age
&quot; more than 7@@ .000 kilometers south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a - a village , which is practically at the top of the biggest g@@ arb@@ age dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paragu@@ ays capital - on instruments , which are made of recycl@@ ed material material : &quot;
&quot; music with re @-@ prepared instruments that consist of local solid waste materials , manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ eur@@ a , where the recycl@@ er have started under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ ve@@ z , to transform parts of the section into instruments . &quot;
&quot; instruments im@@ itate , viol@@ as , c@@ elli , double @-@ bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , saxophone , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and percussion that were all made out of the tr@@ ash . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ pertoire covers classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ic and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article that Los Angeles Times re@@ minds F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ ve@@ z , a local o@@ en@@ ologist and musicians of the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a , to the initial time : &quot;
&quot; first it was very difficult , because we had no place to tri@@ als and we had to stay in the same place , where the parents worked in the tr@@ ash , the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents , because many of them do not live with their children . &quot;
&quot; this changed as a F@@ avi@@ o something was shown , what he had never seen before : one made out of waste . &quot;
&quot; today , there is a whole orchestra , plays on instruments from re @-@ prepared material and which is the recycl@@ ed Orchestra . &quot;
a documentation named &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic Mü@@ ll@@ de@@ pon@@ ie ) draws the musical performance to :
the world generates every year approximately one billion tonnes tr@@ ash .
those who live with him and from him are the sle@@ eves - as people in Cat@@ eur@@ a . Paraguay .
and here they transform him into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ing spect@@ acle from waste @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra has even played its music from Pop@@ e Franzis@@ kus :
these Eastern African countries show how technology and team@@ work can fight against illegal fishing industry
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fought the wild illegal fish@@ eries .
&quot; this article , written by Emma Bry@@ ce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , published a magazine that targeted by international , practical solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
the re @-@ release happens during an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
&quot; in West Africa was then known that this ship had already run in li@@ ft@@ an waters illegal fishing , before moving the other coast of Africa . &quot;
the Eastern African countries were raised over dem@@ arc@@ ation and little gen@@ ei@@ ves to welcome a bill of cri@@ minal off@@ ences of this kind in its chic@@ ory .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Comor@@ os , Mozambique and the Seychelles mobil@@ ised themselves rapidly against the ship . they den@@ ied him to hur@@ ry one of their ports and pro@@ long@@ ed him to tell him a fishing . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister is surrounded by countries that you simply den@@ ied everything , Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a quiet@@ ly employee of the Ken@@ yan fisher@@ men . it is part of a team that discovered the ship and persec@@ uted . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was then displac@@ ed from the waters of the region : it was not succe@@ eded to catch there fish . &quot;
&quot; finally , there was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia due to pill@@ age the fisher@@ men of the country . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , the cri@@ minal practices passed through and resources was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the NR@@ O Stop Ill@@ egal Fishing Association ( Ill@@ eg@@ ale fishing ) . &quot;
the members of this network are among Somalia and Madagascar the six countries that had distributed the prime minister out of their waters at the time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with this we have eight countries that are equal and working together . you exchange information and stand out each other when it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
illegal fishing is imp@@ reg@@ ated by definition : what is caught it is hidden because it is extremely difficult to l@@ ace it is extremely difficult because of it is the illegal fishing of the over@@ fishing of regions .
&quot; through the inten@@ tional dis@@ regard of existing laws , by which certain hab@@ itats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing eco@@ systems can have a del@@ ik@@ i@@ ous balance . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing were once performed by bureaucr@@ atic du@@ ms , with the information between individual countries , so the actions occur in real time , with trac@@ eable on F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; there , the individual countries can inter@@ act with each other than lists existing licenses , news on gener@@ ating activities or details that have noticed or experienced during a long@@ itude . &quot;
&quot; Fish @-@ i pur@@ sues the activities of ships also very attentive , when they move on the open sea , using satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this allows to mark the authorities , ships to mark those in the botan@@ ic areas . even such a divi@@ de drive trav@@ els - about such that indicate that a ship invites you to go on other ships on other ships . &quot;
&quot; basically such investig@@ ations can show such investig@@ ations whether the participating ships have a fishing license , where they were on the road and may also be whether they have a pen@@ alty . &quot;
&quot; countries that are against illegal fishing , can not be den@@ ied on the basis of such ships in their ports . and that they may not sell their charge of pun@@ ishment , and that they may even be forced to be part of pun@@ ishment , as in the case of prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is about considerable financial losses for the owners , meaning that illegal fishing is not worth@@ while . &quot;
&quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , lei@@ tender Director of NF@@ DS Africa . the latter is a Ber@@ ater@@ company that focuses on the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already mentioned platform was created to win estimated 20 million USD to re@@ tired sales , which will lose eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i every year because of illegal fisher@@ men , which in eastern African waters . &quot;
&quot; East @-@ Africa has one of the productive t@@ una fishing , even for the region of commercial fish@@ eries from around the world . among these also those illegal fisher@@ men . &quot;
&quot; their practices include actions like the sailing under the wrong flag , f@@ ake licens@@ ing , specification of fantas@@ ies , the fish @-@ protected species and fishing in nature reserve . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they make use the lack of international cooperation and make the weak@@ nesses of a non @-@ qu@@ ito organised control system &quot; , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; formerly a ship was illegal and a country could then say &apos; You can &apos;t run my port . &quot;
&quot; yet another country could say &apos; Kom@@ m to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; and just this leg@@ ale d@@ fl@@ ed try to finish F@@ ISH @-@ i now . &quot;
so far the closed front .
since its founding F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 exam@@ inations for over 30 studies .
&quot; it has cri@@ minal networks exposed , the f@@ ake licenses distributed in Tanzania . it discovered ships that have several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and found it fle@@ eting ships and found . &quot;
&quot; due to its collaboration with Inter@@ pol , international authority to fight crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investig@@ ations lead us pretty far into the networks of organised crime &quot; , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
he builds a system to help the F@@ ISH @-@ i to be condem@@ ned ships precise .
photo with friendly permission of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; Fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system that will always be further developed , also helps them to watch the illegal ships that would like to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; illegal fisher@@ men use very refined techniques to hide their activities and position , &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Ch@@ ef@@ analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , a NR@@ O , who also deals with fish@@ eries data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
some of the ships turn off for example its automatic identification systems from which they can no longer be carried out from satellite .
Cop@@ eland helps to build a system which connects different information levels . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find cri@@ minal ships with bigger precision .
one model @-@ program
yet F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team African nations did actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing industry ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the NR@@ O Sky@@ Truth , believe that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened together with Google and the marine organization of Oce@@ ana , the platform Global Fishing Watch opened : a platform , the satellite transmission offers and by means of the position of each individual adjust@@ able ship worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; meet with the neighb@@ ors to get a better image of who what is doing - that makes it simply mind , &quot; &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to negoti@@ ate themselves and their resources to the examination . &quot;
&quot; we should do this at global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run , where a global system allows the persecution of ships . &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only cri@@ minals .
ships used to reck@@ on earlier without licence and barely changed with consequences they know that they are observed .
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participated in F@@ ISH @-@ i countries now have a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries chip@@ set , since there are more licenses for more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia helped , Gre@@ ko 1 raised , the insp@@ ectors found there on board tow@@ ing networks , whose application is prohibited . &quot;
photo with friendly permission of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries please note these achievements . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that us now also have other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we are going to disappear several hundred million dollars by illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 six countries were joined together , to the so called West Africa Task Force . also they fight against illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model such as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With Safety is the goal , even more such initiatives and structures also arise in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s young@@ est member states to report his first big tri@@ umph : in October there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship which was on the road under the wrong flag . and not only the ship was on the road and were used in tow@@ ing networks , which is now forbidden . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also still used in bot@@ any waters which are reserved for fisher@@ men from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the Taking of measure rules against Gre@@ ko 1 set the a strong sign that they pron@@ ounc@@ ed against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time evidence that such a special , collabor@@ ative approach to protect the oc@@ eans actually works . Emma Bry@@ ce is freel@@ ance journ@@ alist and lives in London . there she writes the topic environment , technology and nutrition . &quot;
&quot; their articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , The New York Times and The Guardian . location in Venezuela continues to go on : demonstr@@ ations in several cities with the aim to conqu@@ er the country &quot;
the movements in Venezuela only seem to be the beginning of a wave of he@@ fty demonstr@@ ations .
&quot; they are considered to stop prot@@ est against the decision of the government , the refer@@ endum on the amps of the President Nicol@@ á@@ s Mad@@ uro . &quot;

&quot; after the government was rej@@ ected the application of the opposition to a refer@@ endum on the counter@@ part , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans , in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country to the Le@@ ers were gathered together on the roads . &quot;
under the has@@ ht@@ ag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the return of emb@@ assy ) can be found both pictures of these demonstr@@ ations as well as arguments for and against them .
&quot; the debate is also led in other parts of the country - among other things in the Flat@@ land of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ den@@ ies Mé@@ rida and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in central @-@ north @-@ Parliament , Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the federal state Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
the political and economic situation of the country det@@ eri@@ or@@ ated continuously what is notic@@ eable in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by a ac@@ ute lack of food and drugs .
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw in the ab@@ olition of the current President Nicol@@ á@@ s Mad@@ uro , the chance of a fundamental change ; but ultimately the ending of a re @-@ election was block@@ ed by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , contribut@@ ors at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , deals with the latest articles in the context of the Government law : &quot;
&quot; within the framework of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the in@@ fl@@ ation of violence is estimated to be estimated at 500 % of the year ( the in@@ fl@@ ation rate ) and in which a graphical and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine , the refer@@ endum is regarded as the only way to conqu@@ er its institutional structures and a new government alliance . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the elect@@ oral M@@ esa de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( about : r@@ under table of the Democratic Republic ) in which the demonstr@@ ators came to support from representatives from the opposition to the majority of October , on October 27 , the block@@ ing of the refer@@ endum , should continue to continue the block@@ ing of the refer@@ endum . &quot;

especially large waves suggested the news on polished op@@ pression in the central @-@ north city of Marac@@ ay .
&quot; there , the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local Cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government . &quot;
hours later she could safely leave the Cathedral again but the prot@@ ests went on .
&quot; in other parts of the country we tried to stop some prot@@ esters , including those woman in the state of T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira : &quot;

meanwhile you already makes an Inf@@ ographic the round which forms the extent of op@@ pression per day :
thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country to be oppressed .
many representatives of the government had question@@ ed the validity of the demand for an am@@ us@@ sive process . this was now demonstrated in the eyes of many thanks to the presence of countless people on the street .

&quot; this is an adapted version of a interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qu@@ ix@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , a Argentin@@ ean news . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and will be published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qu@@ ix@@ ano was forced by his father to check the at@@ ro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian town of C@@ ó@@ rdoba . &quot;
when now adult husband said Qu@@ ix@@ ano said in the frame of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process in the province of Cordoba against his father .
&quot; in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were examined as committed during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qu@@ ix@@ ano has not been looking for life .
&quot; starting with the Bür@@ de , the same name as his father , up to the bru@@ tal da@@ ir@@ ations at prison La Per@@ la which he was observed at the age of 15 years , he has suffered enough . &quot;
34 years of da@@ ir@@ y he had the family experience for itself .
in the situation at that time I believed that was in order .
I felt like a sal@@ ary .
&quot; as a child with 15 years , one cannot be manip@@ ulated by his father . &quot;
&quot; I was not able to realize that my father was a th@@ ief , tort@@ ur@@ ers and mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qu@@ ix@@ ano was G@@ end@@ arm@@ eri@@ ebe@@ am@@ ic . during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship of 1974 to 1983 , a time of state capitalist dec@@ ay , was his father from 1976 to 1978 . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qu@@ ix@@ ano .
archi@@ ving .
&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qu@@ ix@@ ano , the op@@ press@@ ors , which was charged for ab@@ duction in 158 cases , tort@@ ure , murder in almost 100 cases and the kid@@ n@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qu@@ i@@ jan@@ os son , a man who realized over the years the extent of the at@@ ro@@ cities which he had experienced as a boy , and who said before a Federal Court against his own father . &quot;
his story shows which great power has a par@@ ent part about his child and how this child has chosen a path to salvation .
from the Sp@@ orth@@ alle to the military base
&quot; when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went with us into the sp@@ orth@@ or@@ ite . there I had made me with a boy , the mar@@ tial arts . &quot;
all n@@ ressed him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and some days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and called for me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are a dick@@ head you did you with one of the ERP friends .
pass just that they will not introduce you to one day and I have to save you then .
the abbreviation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo - revolution@@ aries of the military arm of the revolution@@ aries of Argentina .
&quot; therefore , he offered me to go back into the columns . some days later he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
he said to me I would be obe@@ dient .
&quot; I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought , that would be ok . for so my father had moved . &quot;
on the military base I had to destroy Pap@@ ers who had heard the prison@@ ers .
&quot; these were all possible documents : university , hand@@ written notes , literature , certific@@ ates , pro@@ pag@@ and@@ amat@@ erial , books , simply everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ as dr@@ ing become the prison@@ ers &apos; prison@@ ers &apos;
my father took me a total of four times after La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
&quot; during the first and last time , he left me at the entrance in the car . &quot;
&quot; when he took me the second time , he command@@ ed me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ ac@@ ke , in the cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - just everything possible - were standing . &quot;
all of it was st@@ olen .
&quot; he gave me a small in a blank@@ et of wick@@ y and command@@ ed me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that it was a great l@@ ump of silver . &quot;
this day I went to the other end of the bar@@ ac@@ ke where the st@@ olen objects were put together and under@@ held me with a wax@@ ing .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
then the prison@@ ers are tort@@ ured .
I don@@ ated and saw a go@@ at , on the people were tort@@ ured . &quot;
it looked like a fiel@@ d@@ bed and metal @-@ fe@@ athers .
&quot; later I found out that it was attached to it one end of a cab@@ al . the other end was attached to the body of the person , which was straight there . &quot;
&quot; they gathered a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , leave him with water and hunt for a cargo of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ it@@ als . &quot;
photo : Com@@ isi@@ ón Provin@@ cial de la Mem@@ oria
the sten@@ ch there was dr@@ in was hor@@ ri@@ ble ... like a dirty win@@ ch .
&quot; later when my father stood under house @-@ rest , the same smell came from his room . &quot;
I realized the smell immediately and me became clear that that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget that smell .
and I asked me : how is it possible that a human being can do so much suffering ?
&apos;@@ I knew that these people were killed &apos;
&quot; when my father took me for the third time to work , he led me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prison@@ ers with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were carried . &quot;
&quot; he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ u@@ bi &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pe@@ z , a civili@@ ans , who was also in the process ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were shot down with the face - all were on hands and feet .
near the entrance k@@ au@@ ded people still on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; when my father found that I saw to the prison@@ ers , he said , &quot; &quot; What did you so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
&quot; I answered , Why have you brought me to me ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thro@@ wn into a pit and were killed by soldiers and buried .
I know this because my father was at home of it .
&quot; beside La cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were referred to as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero there was a man greeted and killed .
&quot; ( according to details of survi@@ vors the Ci@@ orge Rom@@ ero who was also charged at the La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process , the students of Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to To@@ de ) . &quot;
&quot; in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the head of the memorial la Per@@ la , through the former tort@@ ell@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; the way , on which you came here to come here , is also the way , on which the kid@@ neys came here . &quot;
&quot; if you look on the map , you see that they took about this route and then have been tort@@ ured for the first time . &quot;
&quot; here , their names were changed and they were assigned to a number of the process of de@@ di@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; if they survi@@ ved the tort@@ ure , the prison@@ ers were thro@@ wn into the cu@@ ad@@ ra , until the arrangement of the top came that they should be moved . &quot;
&quot; this was the lie - of Euph@@ oni@@ ism - for the in@@ duction of men , and the dis@@ appearance of their corp@@ ses in most cases . &quot;
the &apos; war@@ fare &apos;
my father brought all kinds of st@@ olen things with home .
back then in the age I had no idea what the &quot; war@@ fare &quot; - how they called it - was .
&quot; but when I was later when I was at the military , - I was clear to the G@@ end@@ ar@@ ie - I was clear to me that war may be a Ba@@ j@@ on@@ ett or perhaps military signs that one assu@@ mes a fo@@ e , which one has fought . &quot;

&quot; but when one goes into a house and the fridge , the record player , clothing , paintings , money ... , then this is not a war but Vand@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always asked me how my father , the head of security forces , with this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I understand it simply .
I was also offic@@ er at G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would have never noticed it into a house and put it all in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my Father could do this .
once he called me a cri@@ minals and I rep@@ lied : and you , who you left cars on the street ? &quot;
you are not a cri@@ minals ?
he explo@@ ded before anger , sm@@ ote me and cri@@ ed : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and bring you own hang@@ ing . &quot;
that &apos;s why we need no one else !
so was my father .
I have no good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the trial , I showed a photo of back then I had a jacket and a roller pul@@ lover of w@@ ool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothes with home . &quot;
&quot; then , the defense , a co @-@ conspir@@ ators had been in this crime . I re@@ fu@@ te , no problem , they can lay down to me what they wanted . &quot;
I was anyway there to speak .
&apos;@@ the sc@@ end of the body is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act &apos;
&quot; now , where I am older , I find Reu@@ e . &quot;
&quot; I have children . if one has only children , one sees the value of a life . &quot;
one develops and realize that it is wrong to kill .
I even went as far as saying :
&quot; well , you have left over the dictatorship of the dictatorship . however , to the corp@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why children escape ?
&quot; one day my father brought a girl with home , whose mother was killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked me the question : they were tort@@ ured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
they could simply have to bring them into prison .
&quot; I appreciate , it was simply decided to kill these people . however , to leave their corp@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
had these people not also families who have been handed over their immort@@ al re@@ mn@@ ant ?
the tort@@ ure of the body is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act you can do to a man .
&quot; my father told me when the democracy was introduced again , they brought them machines to eliminate the immort@@ al re@@ mn@@ ants of the prison@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; they were sh@@ ines and somewhere escap@@ es - no c@@ lue , where . &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot;
&quot; however , anything remains always . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how you killed people ! &quot;
only to clari@@ fy it : I have nothing against the military .
I even was even at g@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about 20 cri@@ minals - including my father .
&quot; the thought to show my father came during a talk , as he stood under house @-@ rest . &quot;
&quot; I made him ac@@ cus@@ ation because of all of the at@@ ro@@ cities , which I had to experience . &quot;
&quot; then he did suddenly , &quot; &quot; I know not . I did not have any@@ body . &quot;
&quot; I felt rem@@ ind@@ ed and asked me how the whole survi@@ ving patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; that they supp@@ os@@ edly def@@ ended , actually good . &quot;
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
how can you tell me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed hor@@ ri@@ ble crimes and you have forced me as a child to you .
he dis@@ gu@@ ed only &quot; Well then taking me on . &quot;
this is what I did .
2010 I ref@@ unds the first ad .
I had finally recognized that he was a cri@@ minals .
nobody can imagine that I am bi@@ ased . I finally have said about my own father .
Luis Alberto Qu@@ ix@@ ano died in May 2015 under house @-@ rest even before the end of the process .
&quot; it was charged with 416 Cri@@ mes , including harder , un@@ law@@ ful imp@@ ris@@ on@@ ment in 158 cases , tort@@ ure in 154 cases , tort@@ ure in five cases and a case of de@@ duction of one under 10 @-@ year child . &quot;

a transl@@ ator turns older people in Ky@@ oto to &quot; fear@@ able drive &quot;

the photo was spread in social media .
elabor@@ ation of the original images of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city Ky@@ oto became the customer of a newly opened center in which you can extend his leaders in the last month witnesses of a very popular translation .
&quot; a sign was translated on a sign the Japanese word in the area and the &quot; &quot; el@@ ong@@ un@@ ten@@ sha , &quot; the &quot; older car &quot; means , &quot; but perhaps also with mal@@ ign@@ ant hind@@ ran@@ ces &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; &quot; terrible drive &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was read from 1 to 20 September to electronic display in the input area and in the building itself .
&quot; elabor@@ ation of the original images of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which has been distributed in the social media . &quot;
&quot; the mistake had been answered by the transl@@ ator Julian Hol@@ mes , a population of Ky@@ ot@@ os , and it was also that made the loc@@ als . &quot;
the Ky@@ oto Shi@@ m@@ bu@@ n was written in Ky@@ oto Shi@@ m@@ bu@@ n :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
pro@@ ving that no one has read the translation of correc@@ tion .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international town like Ky@@ oto just un@@ acceptable , &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was first removed . the name &quot; &quot; drivers &quot; &quot; ( german : &quot; &quot; terrible motor@@ cyclists &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate name &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; ) later by the appropriate term &quot; &quot; Elder &quot; &quot; ( german : &quot; older motor@@ ists &quot; ) . &quot;
the police of the pre@@ f@@ ecture Ky@@ oto exc@@ used for the transl@@ ators . furthermore it explained that the error was already given in the text by the transl@@ ators and that the translation was not tested on its accuracy before it was published .
a blog@@ ger reported as follows on the sorry :
&quot; sorry , that older people felt by in@@ sufficient correc@@ tion ( the translation ) of our turn , &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot;
&quot; the Japanese online news service , J @-@ C@@ ast News set up a little exec@@ utable with the phenomenon of the &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; older motor@@ cyclists in Japan and wrote : &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; terri@@ bly &quot; was den@@ ounc@@ ed as an in@@ appropriate description of the auto@@ s . according to the police are the share of the val@@ leys which are land@@ locked far in acci@@ dents , but quite a matter of concern . &quot;
in the pre@@ f@@ ecture Ky@@ oto for example were caused in 2005 1.@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 460 acci@@ dents of seniors . this corresponds to a percentage of 10 % .
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , presented seniors 1.@@ 803 of a total of 11.@@ 850 acci@@ dents . &quot;
&quot; thus , their share rose to 17,@@ 7 % . &quot;
&quot; while the number of acci@@ dents in total is dro@@ pped , the proportion of Sen@@ iors has ris@@ en acci@@ dents in the same period . &quot;
&quot; the not@@ ably not mentioned repor@@ ters brought in the on Yahoo released version of the article comments to light , which show that pre@@ judi@@ ces some Japanese se@@ em@@ ingly against older pi@@ ers : &quot;
the article on Yahoo about the transl@@ ators was among other things the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; terrible motor@@ cyclists &quot; ) about not the reality ?
&quot; - so faul@@ ty the translation is not at all , or ? &quot;
- &quot; I do not find that this is a real translation error .
there are no few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread in Asia
transl@@ ators are widespread in Japan and all Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a true foundation for this bizar@@ re bug in English .
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Andrew .
the reasons for the wide circulation of transl@@ ators are mani@@ fold .
&quot; to cover , one requires two important skills : passive language skills to understand the output text and active language skills to transfer him into the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter does not require the active domination of the goal - something that is in the event of the event . generally , the con@@ vic@@ tion that transl@@ ators should be in the target language - not in the output language - Mother &apos;s language . &quot;
so a French wom@@ b should translate for example from English to French - not from French .
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies emp@@ loy a lot of staff with English as a mother tongue , the translations into English . this may result in lack@@ ing understanding of the super@@ vis@@ e , cost , or the relatively small number of English speakers who have to learn . &quot;
&quot; some companies who have no foreign employees , however , the Japanese staff will have completed and then the Japanese staff , whose English is made as the best of the transl@@ ators - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are . &quot;
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Karl Baron .
automated translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; the wor@@ r@@ inted and enig@@ matic pro@@ positions which arise by automated translations , that this technique cannot replace any human transl@@ ators . this applies to some languages very special . &quot;
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English phr@@ ases in Japan , including the enig@@ matic printing prints , often used T @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood . &quot;
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation error may be acceptable or acceptable or at least harm@@ less . but of large companies or from the government that have the means to guarantee higher standards , we can expect more careful translations . &quot;
the city of Ky@@ oto is hopefully in the future a respect@@ ful source of their translations .
Venezuela : prot@@ ests and counting on the Internet and TV
main@@ page of the Port@@ als &quot; Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pren@@ sa y soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Fri@@ day@@ morning , 7th April , mel@@ dered Venezu@@ el@@ an internet useful that they had no access to the online channels Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the internet conver@@ ts of VP@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV is no longer accessible . &quot;
&quot; other online stations over@@ took photos of the prot@@ ests in Car@@ acas , which were organised by op@@ position@@ ally groups , which were res@@ our@@ ing by the government of Nicol@@ á@@ s Ma@@ du@@ ros . &quot;
&quot; the prot@@ ests began in early April , after the Supreme Court affir@@ m the Parliament and transferred the parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journ@@ alist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Tr@@ ac@@ er@@ out@@ es . he pointed out that the connection was f@@ ancy , and received the users , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet . &quot;
# Zen@@ sur : enables your VPN .
it appears that Internet site of Venezu@@ el@@ an Provider is once again closed .
this is from the side of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; special offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with internet access , especially at times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media has been del@@ ayed since 2014 with reporting on prot@@ ests . at that time they are threatened with money and closure , as they continue to report on demonstr@@ ations , as the Commission saw this as &quot; call for violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
without cable TV and informative national television channels I have registered again at @ viv@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that the still is cheaper than two lit@@ res lem@@ on@@ ade to buy .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay through a block@@ ing of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two more online channels . this also affects the website where the National Assembly is transferred to its meetings . &quot;
&quot; earlier subscri@@ p@@ tions of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , we had to use the local Internet providers to use DNS . these are a technique required by which the DNS servers have been answered by certain domains . &quot;
&quot; if a website is block@@ ed by the DNS , the server is faul@@ ty or ref@@ use the request while calling on such a website . &quot;
we confirm a DNS @-@ Sper@@ re : @ el@@ ov@@ oli@@ ot@@ v @ VP@@ IT@@ V and @ viv@@ op@@ lay@@ net

&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government is regulated by the Internet connections : thus the Ven@@ ez@@ ol@@ an@@ chor the access to multimedi@@ al reporting on the current events in the country are still more ag@@ gra@@ v@@ ated . &quot;
in Paraguay many girls get to sla@@ ve to maintain a training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child a cri@@ adi@@ ta . now she visited the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina is fighting for the rights of children and coll@@ ects witness to other cri@@ adi@@ tas , which were exactly like they were victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated version of a report , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with friendly permission of the authors . &quot;
&quot; the article is part of a series with the title &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ uel@@ an , es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que CAEN &quot; ( &quot; pin@@ ning cows , dec@@ aying schools &quot; ) which is processed by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America and re@@ published . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household in which they did not live together with the family who was allowed to eat there .
shortly before her study at the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride through it . &quot;
&quot; the , from which something has become &quot; &quot; said her . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old when Cri@@ adi@@ ta began to work as cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as cri@@ adi@@ c known in Paraguay the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to work to school . &quot;
&quot; the shop is quite simple : a big family with little money sur@@ rounds their min@@ der@@ ful son or her less daughter to another , rich@@ ly family . in exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , however , it is not mentioned that the children must make in@@ numer@@ able days of the work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that is in the context of a treat@@ y which one cannot lift . &quot;
this as a cri@@ cket practice is widely used in Paraguay due to the involvement and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations .
&quot; after completion of their studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization dedicated to the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; they spoke to cri@@ adi@@ tas , especially young girls especially affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - coll@@ ar witness , re@@ cher@@ ished , and p@@ ran@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; she tried to name things on behalf , as the feeling of grati@@ tude , that is v@@ esti@@ fy that the Cri@@ adi@@ c is vac@@ cin@@ ated , guaranteed in general st@@ eppe @-@ silence . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double de@@ ception , &quot; explained Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; since the one hand , the family who lay their daughter in faith , that they can close their education to improve their position in society and &quot; &quot; something from themselves &quot; &quot; can move to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand there is the family that takes the girl with faith and justi@@ fies the exploitation of faith that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise no training would , and perhaps even s@@ hung@@ ry would be . &quot;
the victims of cri@@ b@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is sus@@ pic@@ ked , his family will learn only a lot of years later . &quot;
sometimes they can even learn about it .
&quot; in January 2016 , the previously unknown phenomenon that takes place in the dark &apos;s budget , but a face . &quot;
&quot; as Carolina Mar@@ ín in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú into hospital , her body showed traces of he@@ als blow@@ s . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
it was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former Mil@@ itar@@ ily Tom@@ á@@ s F@@ errei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as an official leader in the population .
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3@@ ,000 inhabitants 250 kilometres to the east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , F@@ errei@@ ra beat a long time with a stick on Mar@@ ín , until they suffered fatal viol@@ ations . &quot;
this should be the last pun@@ ishment in the life of the young girl .
&quot; some days later , the media reported on the inci@@ dent . &quot;
they prayed for the child a cri@@ adi@@ ta was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organisations such as UNI@@ CE@@ F or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made deep into the par@@ agu@@ an society of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
they called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of sla@@ very . &quot;
several do@@ zen people came to Protest@@ ants together and demands that there are no further admin &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay are more cows to be registered as children , compla@@ ined Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to hurt the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighb@@ ors of the sp@@ ars and almost 60 civil society organizations demand@@ ed a generous examination of the case .
&quot; you want that Tom@@ á@@ s F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl , who was condem@@ ned her Cri@@ adi@@ ta to 30 years in prison . &quot;
&quot; if the fall occurs in court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín may be den@@ ied - if for the first time in history Paragu@@ ays is a case of cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go ahead of judgment . &quot;
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
&quot; the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only explo@@ ited as labor , they also live isolated from other girls in their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ ewell , who worked in her father and his father had to sign up and her father lost his work . &quot;
their brothers had to work all work and began to sell on the street or on the market sweets to make money .
but they all went on to school .
Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón in the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
in the house of her employer Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a working between four and six hours every day .
&quot; in this way , she had to share the time so that you have still time for learning . &quot;
they stood every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employer .
&quot; for example , they clean@@ ed the fridge , p@@ utz@@ ed the living room , polished the furniture and des@@ ert@@ ed the floor . &quot;
when the school was at the end she went back home and had time for learning .
&quot; the sooner it was done with learning , the more leisure had it . &quot;
&quot; but even this time was limited , because they had to make dinner for their employers . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says , she had never had to go hung@@ ry , but it was not inde@@ fin@@ itely great food . &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the land@@ lord as eating out of the fridge . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belong@@ ed to the land@@ lord , a former military and sympath@@ izer of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party who was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; on some sections of the househ@@ olds Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , next to him stand and Editorial from opposition to read such as &quot; transm@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this , he tried to convince them to give the reports of official media on the regime of the dict@@ ator of no faith . &quot;
&quot; he held them for intelligent , but not with her . &quot; &quot; the land@@ lord had taken someone who listen@@ ed , while he spoke about politics , &quot; says she . &quot;
&quot; they allowed me not often my family to visit , because they were the opinion that I would like to learn there again &quot; bad habits that belongs to the indigen@@ ous group of Gu@@ ar@@ an@@ í . &quot;
&quot; your Lord fear@@ ed that they were the formation , which she had to lose her again , explains she explained . &quot;
&quot; however , it was entirely clear that they had been paid for everything they paid by them with their hard work . &quot;
&quot; even at school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a discri@@ min@@ ated . &quot; one thing about which is almost never spoken , Mob@@ bing and the chic@@ ks who are exposed to school when they are going to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children parents have , they immediately recognis@@ e that someone who has no parents , a cri@@ adi@@ ta is . &quot;
I could not invite anyone to me at home . I had no friends in school or neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , at the time , where friend@@ ships are created , I felt particularly clear that I belong to any group . &quot;
&quot; the insulation was the worst of all , &quot; &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
the company endor@@ ses the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook Group , where you can see great importance for det@@ erg@@ ent son@@ al and children &apos;s ma@@ ids in Paraguay . &quot;
the administ@@ rators in the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a town@@ house in the district of As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
hello ! I am looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays in the morning and in the afternoon with it .

please enter you .
&quot; beginning from Monday , if possible . &quot;
the ad got five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the place Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she would have a el@@ ic@@ ed girl and gave their telephone number .
&quot; another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered their 15 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ year . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; wrote them . &quot;
&quot; in the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; a girl from the inland , which would like to work . &quot;
&quot; then the dis@@ closure , the display was once again : &quot;
&quot; dear friends , I have found a found . I look if it works with her . &quot;
&quot; thank you , I write again if something is . &quot;
the shop was complete .

legis@@ lative design writes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
picture of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , modified by Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; six@@ ty @-@ Egyptian parliament@@ arians have recently agreed a bill to &quot; regul@@ arities in terms of use and usability of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if he is accepted by the Parliament , you need to register the usability and users of social media in Egypt with a government authority to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law would then be established in a place , which is therefore commissioned to use citizens and use social media . &quot;
within six months of acceptance of the law have to be able to register their usability and users on the web page with their proper name and personal numbers to be able to use social networks .
&quot; there will be failed to do this , this could be a pun@@ ishment of up to six months o@@ ano@@ inted or a cash . &quot;
&quot; the bill is made up of six par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ids and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as a &apos; jed@@ we@@ de application that runs over the internet and used to communicate with other using voice , vide@@ oc@@ ulars and text . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear how the law has en@@ forced when it is approved , as the draft cannot be impos@@ ed on how the Egyptian authorities are unable to register as the Egyptian authorities , which is not able to register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to guarantee regulation on the level of social media company . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , parliament@@ arians , and promot@@ ers of the legis@@ lative process , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received by the tele@@ communication platform to come by the fire@@ wall , the Facebook block@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; that might mean that Egypt is planning to yield a fire@@ wall at national level around Facebook , because of which it would be necessary for the Egyptians to access to their identity to access the network . &quot;
but it has not yet known to exist that such plans are .
experts and experts are sc@@ ep@@ tical on the site are sc@@ ep@@ tical concerning the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Technology ( E@@ IP@@ R , German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I am deeply to do with technical capacities and understanding every authority in Egypt with regard to things that have been dealing with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they think that just as they might be done in viol@@ ent physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take them seriously , then that it means that it is a strong monitoring system to apply for citizens who need to apply a permit or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to bring them to a court process . &quot;
this is technically un@@ realistic - but in Egypt is all possible .
&quot; in order to be passed as a law , the draft is first to be discussed in the legis@@ l@@ atives of the Parliament and the constitu@@ tional Committee before it comes to the Pl@@ en@@ ard@@ eb@@ atte . &quot;
&quot; whether his acceptance and en@@ forcement is successful or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military thinking in parliament , in whose sense the control is max@@ imi@@ zed and ensures that no different f@@ ancy is present on the area , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year the parliamentary elections took Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y a legis@@ lative process against Cy@@ ber @-@ crime , in which a li@@ fel@@ ong adhesi@@ on for those used to be guil@@ ty , the &quot; public order to be threatened &quot; and &quot; to prot@@ est . &quot;

why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; like R@@ aza in the video shows , &quot; &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining le@@ ather@@ edge in the Kur@@ dish eco@@ system , and the health and the th@@ ri@@ ve of the eco@@ system also depends on that a large room is available . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Pers@@ ish Leop@@ ard actually in the free wilderness , and goes against zero . when the team recorded in video that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera , breaks R@@ aza in real pleasure . &quot;

&quot; in early March 2017 , the adv@@ ances for the northe@@ ast@@ ern Jap@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o , the adv@@ ances made in recent six years to re@@ build the lives of those of the &quot; triple @-@ cat@@ astrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a huge earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an At@@ om @-@ accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had trig@@ ger@@ ed the cat@@ astrophe . &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Send@@ ai , which lies in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
&quot; hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbor@@ hoods of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had all the coastal cities go away from the map . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma lived a atom@@ ic accident , even alone , we had to leave their homes less than 160 000 inhabitants . &quot;
the special report of the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o shows from local point of view which progress has been achieved in order to re@@ build the lives of the local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authorities as well as survey results of those affected by itself .
housing in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that until December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses ( including stro@@ kes , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were finished in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures could be accompanied by Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , here 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were finished . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has made 75 percent of such homes , including Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma with 70 percent . &quot;
&quot; well , you still have six years after the cat@@ astrophe , ev@@ acu@@ ated from Beh@@ r@@ fs@@ ad@@ ation ( including stro@@ kes , kas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in final replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after the triple @-@ cat@@ astrophe , almost 80 000 people were forced to live in Beh@@ r@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 still 36 000 people lived from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate in such homes . &quot;
&quot; nearly 40 per cent of the year 2011 ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma still live in emer@@ gency , including Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , which was more successful than 75 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated leading to the disaster in Beh@@ r@@ fs@@ ad@@ mitt@@ ent , were introduced in final homes . &quot;
for I@@ w@@ ate the number is found here at 34 per cent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ters
&quot; as the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o Zeitung has been able to det@@ ect 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , which were affected by the un@@ happiness , to open its doors up to December 2016 , which makes almost 98 percent of schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ters . &quot;
six years later that industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
&quot; while almost 100 percent of fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i again are again in operation , have res@@ um@@ ed at Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma only 30 percent of fish@@ eries ports . &quot;
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atom@@ ic accident occurred in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Agr@@ ar@@ land large @-@ scale in collaboration .
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could re@@ produce 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 per cent of the A@@ cker@@ lan@@ es in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 per cent destroyed A@@ cker@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ likely that this is just a consequence of nuclear dis@@ rup@@ tions , because only 690 acres of 5 400 hectares destroyed A@@ cker@@ lan@@ des of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , lie in the &quot; nuclear pl@@ ague zone . &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has repe@@ at@@ edly recover , but also there remains Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma far too be@@ aten . &quot;
&quot; the tourist destinations in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back to 90 percent on the same level , as before the un@@ happiness . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma can be found here only 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since disaster nearly half of the coast @-@ inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their hab@@ itats . &quot;
is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; in order to determine a total picture , the paper introduced numerous sur@@ veys among the native population and among the ev@@ acu@@ ated by . she asked them about the state of the re @-@ rising and also as their sens@@ ations has changed towards the ts@@ un@@ ami risk . &quot;
in her introduction of the article explains the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper :
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o led a survey by to bring more about the T@@ sun@@ ami consciousness under the native population in experience .
&quot; the survey brought that 8@@ 3.1 percent of the domestic inhabitants , measures taken to be taken to be prepared for future earthquake and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; however , 5@@ 5.9 percent of respon@@ dents can still be done enough in terms of dis@@ asters prevention . &quot;
how it stands for those who had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated from pre@@ f@@ ecture Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma ev@@ acu@@ ated
&quot; in its edition of the anniversary of the earthquake , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper began their attention to the situation of ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to experience not only the massive earthquake and the dev@@ ast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami no , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma was also witness of the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , atom@@ ic inci@@ dent , the Japan ever had to experience . &quot;
&quot; from 160 000 Ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 there were slightly more than 23 000 people , returned to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , in permanent replacement houses . &quot;
after the state of 2017 still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
&quot; most of the ev@@ acu@@ ated areas are most of the ev@@ acu@@ ated , older than 50 years old . they have to compete in real per@@ cep@@ tions because efforts made for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma with massive building projects . this is what the efforts made for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma with massive building projects . this is what the efforts for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma will have to compete in Tokyo . &quot;
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when man met people from other countries , who speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities . &quot;
after a while you can often see that one more links it appears at first sight .
&quot; these global connections are important , as they are demanding our pre@@ judi@@ ces to expand our perspectives and remind us that the world ultimately is very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Podcast , we look carefully these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Podcast we treat subjects that often get less attention in reporting than they deser@@ ve . &quot;
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember to a moment in which they have felt very strong with someone over language and country &apos;s borders .
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ con@@ i says about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i Eg@@ her@@ man says about the time where she worked with people from all over the world ; and Jo@@ ey A@@ you@@ b talks about his experiences which he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

an Brazi@@ lian student at the age of 33 was included this week in the Inten@@ sive station : last Friday brought him a poli@@ ti@@ mid@@ ter during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a stroke against the head . nation@@ wide took millions of prot@@ esters against au@@ sterity .
Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva Tarok the social sciences at the Bundes@@ university Go@@ i@@ á@@ s studied a sk@@ ull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several groups .

his condition is considered to be critical .
the local journ@@ alist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus that quickly spread within a few days fast in Brazil .
&quot; in the pictures also the face of the police station to recognize , who is identified with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o Samp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
&quot; according to the inci@@ dent , the military police were announced in Brazi@@ lian state of Go@@ i@@ á@@ s that Samp@@ ai@@ o was held until the end of the examination of the trial of the active service susp@@ ended . &quot;
the pictures show the police station as he suggests in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his stroke on the face of the student Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; would end a police station of an prot@@ esters , and at the Inten@@ sive station , would be his face six months for television and the entire op@@ pression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook @-@ site &quot; &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press @-@ channel of media @-@ ac@@ tivi@@ sts from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , distributed by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z recorded video on the net , where you can see how Mat@@ eus is att@@ acked by the police station and several sanitary shortly afterwards . &quot;
another video with the same scenes but from another perspective is also fil@@ med in social networks .
in the bottom of the clip you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another State of Mat@@ eus , have now don@@ ated 10,000 Brazi@@ lian re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 Euro ) to cover a part of the cost of medical treatment and to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in hospital . &quot;

Go@@ i@@ á@@ s was not the only state in Brazil that occurred on the last Friday to the bru@@ tal police principles against demonstr@@ ators .

&quot; ME@@ P Fl@@ avi@@ o Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Fried@@ en@@ spart@@ ei ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police via loud@@ speakers on violence against demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazi@@ lian media street prot@@ ests that they focus on another , un@@ expected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window . &quot;
Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported targeted on a bro@@ ader glass window to shape with a photo their title pages illustr@@ ative .
&quot; in contrast , the O Glo@@ bo had a title story by one in the brand used bus . &quot;
&quot; there is no pl@@ au@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a dis@@ ken window than about the prot@@ ests of thousands of people who serve the defence of a special matter . &quot;

&quot; the Volks@@ gemein@@ de Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , which is in the Western Cu@@ ban Province of May@@ abe@@ que , is commonly known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - regardless of it is no ad@@ orable sugar . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities were placed in the sugar components .
&quot; after the yield , the sugar levels stood still in the region and the factory were lost according to and after its facilities , until only the sm@@ ells from steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 272 workers had to find new .
some are rare the work .
others res@@ orting and pend@@ ables daily to the fact@@ ories that still ma@@ sts .
&quot; N@@ ene , a sol@@ dier veter@@ an that stands every day at 4 : 00 am in the morning , the crisis in the sugar industry does not smoke his sleep . &quot;
he heard that there are in the east of the region of sugar beams that are after a long in@@ active time in operation because they were obtained .
that was something that he was not expected .
&quot; N@@ ene remember exactly , that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich would get the sugar factory , but the promise was not held . &quot;
&quot; the sugar @-@ industry already resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market price , of in@@ efficiency , the bad administrative offer@@ ings and climate change . &quot;
&quot; 2016 was the production of 1,6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced . &quot;
the message would have been a mot@@ if for a few decades ago a motive for wor@@ rying for the country but the bad y@@ iel@@ ds are already no re@@ union .
why was the Cu@@ ban grinding industry turned off ?
the old railway station of the municipality looked at even better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the shr@@ ine of the sugar industry was an economic necessity : the 155 su@@ ro@@ hr@@ fab@@ ri@@ ken were technically obsolete , and hardly competitive it became inev@@ itable for the country . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate on the most efficient fact@@ ories , the annual production of production was 4 million tons . &quot;
they only settled the fact@@ ories that can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.25 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the moti@@ ves that led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar plant@@ ations and the su@@ gar@@ ments rise on the world market .
yet the sugar @-@ price increased in front of about a decade .
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per po@@ unds will remain issued by the OECD and FA@@ O , the agricultural and nutrition organization of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3,6 million tonnes ) , the Roh@@ zu@@ cker exports would be about 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will continue to go into history , these were the first words of the Cu@@ ban President of F@@ ide@@ l Cast@@ ro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from there , the process of re@@ struc@@ turing in the sugar industries . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , the down@@ time of 98 su@@ peri@@ o@@ fab@@ ri@@ ken came to more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for education . &quot;
the same happened in the sugar Greg@@ orio Arl@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as sol@@ dier , talking about the closure of the factory , is the word that he is most repeated , &quot; betra@@ y@@ al . &quot;
nearly all respon@@ dents are of the same opinion : not one of them were informed that the factory would be imp@@ ris@@ oned .
&quot; so that the place is preserved , they set a full @-@ time working group . &quot;

first Nations @-@ Youth take advantage of Hip Hop to express themselves and maintain its own culture
recording a song from &apos; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .

&quot; young people of the First Nations Communities across Canada are dealing with subjects that are important for them . they do this by Hip Hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops . &quot;
&quot; as part of the N &apos; we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour since 2014 Work@@ shop@@ leader mobile ton@@ studios will bring directly to schools and youth centers in order to bring youth groups , recording , audio groups and video production . &quot;
the original workshops were led by the P@@ äd@@ ag@@ ogen David Hod@@ ges who lives in Montreal and lives in Nord @-@ Quebec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then with the Cre@@ e Hip Hop @-@ Gruppe The North@@ stars .
&quot; the workshop rises that the young participants in interviews , such as &quot; cultural identity , language , examination , love , self @-@ sufficient &quot; &quot; or whatever they always come to sense . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main ones .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team worked with other First Nations Communities in the Canadian Province British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the W@@ inn@@ eb@@ ago in the US state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of school &apos;@@ Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Yo@@ o in British Columbia tells the story of Highway 16 , as well as the Highway of the Highway 16 , also &quot; Highway of t@@ ears &quot; , &quot; in which almost two do@@ zen young women dis@@ appeared or mur@@ dered . &quot;
the cases were largely un@@ solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ aska Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motive of a video player to con@@ vey how important to receiving traditional customs and customs in spite of influences the glob@@ alisation .
many of the songs appeared in indigen@@ ous languages even though the young people must not always conqu@@ er the languages of the First Nations .
&quot; in the following song that Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation will have recorded , the ref@@ rain is sung on Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; the young people received a little help from Gary Jol@@ ly by the North@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop Group , which gave them a st@@ rop@@ he in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; at the Fac@@ ebook@@ side of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the St@@ rop@@ he is at your disposal , as a translation into German , which is translated into German : &quot;
sometimes I feel as would not ever feel interested in me
but I try to go on the earth on earth
this is the day where you will take our scre@@ am
because we have lost our way in life as youth
&quot; but I believe that we will rise to one day , &quot;
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow up and also of our youth
&quot; so they can do this , how to them the creator has been determined . &quot;
in the commentary box of the reader and the authors of the Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also add a post and adds the St@@ rop@@ he in Sil@@ ben@@ ign ( which will also be published on his blog and published here with permission ) :

in Japan you can see almost every restaurant sculp@@ tural dishes .
&quot; to show potential customers , which is exactly on the menu , are usually issued on the menu , close to the entrance to the restaurant , &quot; plastic models of dishes &quot; ) of every food , which is served in this restaurant . &quot;
customers look at these plastic geri@@ es and then decide whether they entered the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry that is dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic pipes .
&quot; in the Tok@@ yo@@ und@@ ing district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi there are a variety of these small companies that produce the German Fil@@ mm@@ akers W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a in more than 20 years ago . &quot;
for most of the Japanese are these plastic geri@@ es so usually that they are not even better . a new trend turns it today in stri@@ king phone accessories and other gad@@ gets .
&quot; at Nav@@ er Mat@@ ome released the Blog@@ ger it@@ ini@@ i Series of Social Media Links and photos , which show this unusual tw@@ ist with the sho@@ ku@@ hin sandy beach . &quot;
&quot; now in special sale : new with plastic bottles , as well as they are shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store . &quot;
&quot; many of these arti@@ ficial foods were transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y collective @-@ objects , as in this case , refriger@@ ators : &quot;
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ vice cooler for a new exhibition at Tokyo @-@ Station .
the new boom of the Essen@@ tial exhibitions is becoming increasingly emerging .
in this case a ph@@ ais@@ en @-@ don ( a popular rice shell with seafood ) turned into a cell phone .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lol ) we found a good use as a cell phone .
also this part we have made for the exhibition at Tokyo .
and here is an apple containing your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a cand@@ le for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and this is just the beginning of an increasing arrival to the Com@@ ic .
&quot; some mobile phone @-@ stand and mobile devices permit you to produce your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura or sal@@ mon is used , a popular t@@ opping , which is served with white rice . &quot;
on Twitter had some users their dou@@ bts :
&quot; are there someone who would say : &quot; wow , cool , now I can decor@@ ate my mobile phone with sal@@ mon . &quot;
I think I will probably be the one .
&quot; this interest in plastics , can also take a less appe@@ tiz@@ ing form to surprise for example colleagues or family members . &quot;
our new@@ est cell phone has the form of mel@@ ting ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also travel@@ ing@@ balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , Earrings and Hand@@ y@@ bands from dried sal@@ mon . &quot;
you can view more sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile plastic pipes , you can view from : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Nav@@ er Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter to the has@@ ht@@ ag # the land@@ mark of the land@@ mark &quot;
&quot; if you like to learn more about the origin of this trends , then this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , who is dedicated to the sh@@ ining of the restaurant industry . as for example with the sho@@ ku@@ hin sandy beach . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese Plas@@ tics are actually made .
a mex@@ ican project tells the stories of the survi@@ vors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against the drug dealers . &quot;

&quot; in reports in@@ - and foreign media about the inf@@ am@@ ous &quot; fight against drug trading &quot; in Mexico , the missing and mur@@ dered only reflected in statistics . however , they do not reflect the extent of the human trag@@ edy , which brings this fight with itself . &quot;
&quot; reporting on drug addi@@ tives such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the Chief of the Sin@@ al@@ oa @-@ Kart@@ ells , the stories of the victims of the conflict was totally in the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a non @-@ viol@@ ent inci@@ dent , someone looks at the grap@@ e or to the municip@@ alities who have learned with pain . &quot;
&quot; standing behind each body , behind each bone fund in the hundreds of secret tren@@ ches , the stories of tax@@ ies parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wo@@ unds may never he@@ al . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico is called the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vivi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with drug trading live &quot; ) and told the stories of people who were in the fight between the Prosec@@ ution and cart@@ els . &quot;
Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project so :
organised crime leaves us not only to fear our lives .
the effects are much deeper .
&quot; for example , if stores conclude because they are threatened by drug @-@ hang@@ ers and whole communities will therefore have a lot of kilometres to buy something like milk . &quot;
the Pain of victims
a video called &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear life changed &quot; ) tells us exactly these stories .
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , which is still looking for every weekend tom@@ bs to his son . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Rod@@ r@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who in just one day her father , her four sisters , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ en . &quot;
&quot; priest : &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again on the task that we have asked to go and go to tom@@ bs , after the people we loved to seek . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Contr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Contr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 as he dis@@ appeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an e @-@ shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; on 15th October he was back again , but he never came again . Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very hard for me because I am now alone with three children who need a training alone . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , which is also here with me . &quot;
at the moment it has no income .
&quot; you do not have the insurance of my father , but it does not get paid , because it does not require mort@@ als . &quot;
where should we get it ? &quot;
the editor of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vi@@ vi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we don &apos;t just have to show the faces of those who face the fear . we must show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and ci@@ tiz@@ ens@@ hip . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; KY@@ H@@ B , a Les@@ er of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the federal state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central America . &quot;
&quot; your contribution re@@ minds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
illness and sens@@ ational journ@@ alism I have now been working for several years .
I come over every day at the time of time and see the title pages with pictures that actually only come from a text@@ book for cri@@ min@@ ology or from the experts of specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
&quot; sometimes I feel the feeling , as if I am the one who was charged or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belong@@ ed to this body . &quot;
I cannot be indi@@ fferent at this time or consider it as normal .
she writes on :
&quot; no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year old cous@@ in thinks that he is Nar@@ co ( german : drug dealers ) if he is great . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me this is , as if they teeth those who have lost someone and those who have fear that also happens so something . &quot;
I see our weak@@ ness when stories to mere numbers are being given in statistics .
the in@@ action of men is unbeliev@@ able for me when the death of six people and the tort@@ ure of 43 students are justified in a neighbor@@ ing place that they were abandoned .
I think they try to talk about that they are spar@@ ed by such trag@@ edi@@ es if they are not tou@@ ching and silent .
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City has written the contribution &quot; &quot; Four months Er@@ pres@@ ses in Haupt@@ stadt@@ bir@@ ths : like a family with Dro@@ men pres@@ idency &quot; . &quot; in this , it describes how armed cri@@ minal month for month money were destroyed by their business until they had not only been destroyed the business , but also their family apart . &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; Pain about it never goes , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear will be back up if you are alone . &quot;
Habits have changed too and phone numbers too .
we just contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the more we are removed , the better . &quot;
she en@@ closed her report by words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because one does not know when they will lead you or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself in these terrible days , though wines would solve my deep@@ ened feelings , but the answer is no , because I have forgotten how to w@@ ept . I have to learn to live with pain . &quot;
the journ@@ alist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : one of violence marked .
in the introduction he ra@@ ises questions on how : who takes care of the child of a missing woman and a man that was mur@@ dered by the organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mex@@ ik@@ os ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents worry about them . &quot;
&quot; br@@ yan is a gu@@ ise and he tells that he had to bring herself , how to make a egg , pot@@ atoes , tor@@ till@@ as warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies , who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of vi@@ al with water , sugar and da@@ ir@@ y powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for each year .
but they are un@@ important compared to pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boys for all the life of violence and he had to learn to live .
&quot; when he was five years old , he said to him that his mother had dis@@ appeared . &quot;
&quot; but this was not the day , in which his child@@ hood ended . &quot;
&quot; his child@@ hood has been past two years ago when he was only a few blocks away from his home , the blo@@ ody corp@@ se of his father had been shot out of armed men from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; as Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez saw this : &quot;
br@@ yan was born in 2006 as violence by organised crime and the struggle against the existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
&quot; 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murder , based on public safety and government of the Government of the United States . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 , the Prosec@@ ution 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to the cut 8,5 Mor@@ der per day . &quot;
&quot; these are only a few of hundreds of thousands of stories , that leaves the organised crime in Mexico and in the soul of the country . &quot;
only a few stories still live up with new headlines . but this project is rem@@ ind@@ ed of those that we may not forget .
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vivi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; has called Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico 2015 , whose aim is to have completed the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug in the last four decades . &quot;
if a picture is worth a thousand words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Flick@@ r @-@ User Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ strö@@ m ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) WAR@@ NI@@ NG : this post and the pages that he left , contain pictures , on which violence is shown . &quot;
&quot; the fact check is important in a moment , in which it comes to emph@@ asi@@ ze a rum@@ or or a for@@ gery . &quot;
&quot; but how is the years after something the first time been replaced ? content in social media , no matter whether true or un@@ true , ten@@ ds to exist . &quot;
let us take this photo of a terrible accident prior to seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
&quot; since its first release , it has been mis@@ led to illustr@@ ated trag@@ edi@@ es , trag@@ edi@@ es , who actually have found in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
this false p@@ air@@ ing of image and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - den@@ ied not the fact that there is plenty of careful coverage of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
it ra@@ ises questions about our desire for pictures to messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
2010 crossed a pet@@ rol car in the east of DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ te and explo@@ ded . &quot;
&quot; according to the civil war , Africa had been neg@@ l@@ ected and thus dev@@ ast@@ ated . the streets in the region have become tough to dangerous paths , which were difficult to drive . &quot;
trag@@ ically from the tank @-@ wag@@ ons fell to the victim .
&quot; he describes a fire@@ ball , the stup@@ id homes including a cin@@ emas close by , which was full of people who illustr@@ ate the football world champion@@ ship . &quot;
houses bur@@ ners and st@@ olen corp@@ ses lay in the streets of sc@@ atter@@ ed .
many people were burned .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria &quot; . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ users M@@ ys@@ tical Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Multi@@ more photos of the inci@@ dent form the gray scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example for it .
it shows rows of st@@ olen body that are called on the ground during people they look at .
but here the story is not its end .
&quot; over the years the same photo was revealed several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , but not in the context of the trag@@ edi@@ es , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , fight@@ ers of the B@@ oko Har@@ am the ent@@ leg@@ acies of B@@ aga and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
&quot; eye @-@ witnesses reported dr@@ as@@ tically of at@@ ro@@ cities , in front of which they had to escape . &quot;
houses and shops were burned down and corp@@ se in streets and h@@ edge .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2@@ ,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; no one stayed back to count suffering , &quot; said a inhabitants of Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were sm@@ iled , shot or burned . &quot;
only on the basis of satellite images could be presented the tort@@ ure .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved but the Army @-@ point in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture emerg@@ ed from the DR Congo again as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented :
this is Nigeria .
a mass@@ ac@@ re at 2.000 people took place two days in Paris .
you are not Charlie .
you are dead .
&quot; in fact , this mis@@ sil@@ ly use of the image from the DR Congo is just one in a series of failure meetings ; Africa Check has been documented regulations for Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
in all these cases the picture was brought to a letter for mass@@ ent@@ atives .
&quot; yet another step further bring personal comments such as this example , the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments . &quot;
the image of a rod entered also in connection with the dead@@ ly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar in appearance .
&quot; according to a light@@ box , published by the United Nations , published by the United Nations , the fle@@ e could fle@@ e , rap@@ e , rap@@ e , and et@@ ri@@ ble t@@ ote , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported by the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts , like the following , these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo brought together : &quot;
&quot; this picture comes from a Saudi Arab news , the President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein being said , mon@@ ks and politicians would have participated in the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the picture from the DR Congo to illustr@@ ate this information . &quot;
&quot; the original fee , on which last was accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other News@@ organisations , the AF@@ P as its source acqu@@ aint@@ ances , had also pre@@ datory this statement , but had not associated with this picture from the DR Congo in the context . &quot;
the worldwide range of wrong information
traces of these false de@@ coupling range up to the years 2011 and 2012 and come back from all over the world .
&quot; using a &quot; &quot; revers@@ ed picture &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can be bound@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the search engine testing with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found under 18,@@ 8 billion images ( stand of 3 May 2017 ) 344 pictures , which are very similar from the DR of Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mixed lot of private sites , platforms social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
some have false reports for@@ war@@ ded but have other tried to de@@ lar@@ ged the for@@ geri@@ es .
&quot; we have given examples of p@@ ending use and brought them linked to the respective countries , based on what page they have been published . thus , we want the range more clearly than by the language alone . &quot;
some cases listed from the listed below ( which in some cases have also been connected together ) can come several examples of ab@@ run@@ ant use .
here some cases which can now be completely elimin@@ ated ( on the map in orange ) :

&quot; this post , who set itself to the members of the Russian @-@ orthod@@ ox community , presents that the image of the DR Congo is NOT for Muslims who kill Christians . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this news has asser@@ ted that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein lies in 2012 , that mon@@ ks and politicians had been involved in the k@@ illing of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story with the image of s@@ ange . &quot;
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture is still included in it .
Spain .
&quot; this article was brought about students from the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , the cath@@ olic area of An@@ á@@ lis@@ is Digital , has explicitly declared that the picture does not come from the pot@@ ters , but it claims that it is like a &quot; similar d@@ anced attack &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when the picture was later in connection with the mass@@ ac@@ re of the B@@ oko Har@@ am from 2015 in circulation , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to re@@ v@@ esti@@ fy that there were connections to Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ ya@@ Yan@@ ı@@ yor@@ d@@ yu@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria bur@@ ns , the world sleeps ) . &quot;
&quot; the picture of the DR Congo , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ has@@ ht@@ ag , on and rede@@ emed a discussion among Muslims after the mass@@ ac@@ re of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the An@@ ch@@ ags on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to achieve that their communities these events took place in the name of the Is@@ l@@ ams , a greater attention . &quot;
USA , 2015 . &quot;
the original has been tested as cover for the mass@@ ac@@ re of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times ret@@ we@@ et@@ et ) . but the messages that were associated with it were in no religious context .
&quot; instead , the goal was to focus attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media pres@@ sur@@ es compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
Vietnam
&quot; after a message , the supp@@ os@@ edly been written by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os &quot; about the solid mass@@ ac@@ re , translated it disc@@ ards such as this here on Vietnamese and explained it to fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
&quot; from the message , in which the picture was taken from the DR of Congo , the organization of Clar@@ et@@ ine Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os . &quot;
&quot; there are further confirmed examples of the missing use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; there are other accounts , agg@@ reg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the cap in Grau ) , Tin@@ Eye also points , but are no longer completely trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with UR@@ Ls and tim@@ est@@ amp / Dat@@ alog@@ amp exist on the web@@ cra@@ w@@ ler and ex@@ iled them via images in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslim . )
&quot; in all these cases , which appeared only clear after the original mis@@ e of 2010 , the picture ultimately contributes to a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and pictures
there are two strong topics or frames ( fr@@ aming ) that passes these posts . the first frame is focused on religion .
the photo was used in terms of greater discussions about the silence associated with the encour@@ ages of Christians by Muslims or - for the defence of Muslims - the ordin@@ ances of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as through Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how to under@@ rated a African life compared to a European or French life .
religion understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth to investig@@ ate how pictures in connection with these efforts are being used .
&quot; however , a deeper question is what happens when readers may not give these pictures no longer believ@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are many people who are un@@ inten@@ tional to carry out the water around a trag@@ edy . &quot;
&quot; sug@@ ru@@ ert this mood of the mal@@ low and fal@@ seh@@ ood , that actual at@@ ro@@ cities are un@@ true and tasty it the real Gre@@ ys of what actually happened in the DR Congo , in Nigeria and in Burma ? &quot;
the spread of viol@@ ent pictures has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( here for example ) .
&quot; an argument is that the rest@@ ing of pictures of a cros@@ sover comparison , the trag@@ edy will recognis@@ e the trag@@ edy . sometimes these pictures will even be requested by the victims itself . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the concern is that viol@@ ent images and audience des@@ en@@ si@@ zing and the ability to receive emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which investig@@ ates how viol@@ ent media act to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is some to discuss non @-@ viol@@ ent portra@@ y@@ als in the news media , is fact that they are indisp@@ ensable for the present news ref@@ unds . &quot;
&quot; technology experim@@ enting with algorith@@ ms to support the fight against &quot; &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; , &quot; in which a picture has to think about what actually , but also derived from context or to completely ab@@ omin@@ ous style can be used . &quot;
&quot; however , any study of fal@@ fa ten@@ ders should also be taken into account as internationally as they can . &quot;

&quot; a blog with the name Un@@ transl@@ at@@ able ( eg@@ . uns@@ ur@@ able ) ende@@ av@@ our to offer a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all . &quot;
such words are available in each language : you press certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these uns@@ ri@@ ble words are already well known ( like the famous Portuguese Sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply ro@@ oted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ brem@@ esa ) .
but all resist@@ ed stu@@ b@@ born every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or an expression is not , why an entire explanation and sometimes some context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for a long time in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists do Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; &quot; transl@@ at@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; in the blog , one can find words from the VAT number of Vanuatu , such as : &quot;

&quot; words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language , who are spoken in parts of Brazil , like : &quot;

photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ ha@@ zi .
use Invest@@ t.@@ Dam@@ as in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighb@@ our and love girlfriend .
&quot; I trust her four year old daughter , she familiar to me her children , she is my rock in the industry . &quot;
in one minute we call slo@@ gans for the rights of women .
in the next sk@@ andi@@ ate we rights for trans@@ gender .
&quot; we are in a sea of rain@@ forests and people , some hold the ic@@ onic picture of a woman with head@@ sc@@ arf high , bound from a American flag , other sk@@ andi@@ st score against Islam@@ op@@ hobia . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; these things do not concern yourself , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; ask myself . &quot;
I already have guided these entertainment .
&quot; people with whom I work , or people who have been familiar with me - the Sah@@ ar that they know - of the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built himself in their concept . &quot;
you have to use me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all equal .
we practic@@ ing our religion different .
we identify with this to be a Muslim to different kind . but somehow we will put all into the same Muslim drawer .
&quot; this drawer is well built in our collective conception that as soon as Muslims , which as I do not match there , they have to be modified . &quot;
must be bor@@ ated
I do not stand alone .
&quot; this is even to the po@@ et , whose poetry is still sold in America : Rum@@ i . &quot;
which pictures are coming to a sense when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
as J@@ al@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now it was an orthod@@ ox mus@@ li@@ ers pre@@ acher and schol@@ ars .
&quot; Islam , the Quran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day , at which he died , the center of his poetry . &quot;
but in the western idea the religion of Rum@@ is has been deleted as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a huge part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
&quot; another is made in the re@@ productions of the Muslim pictures of Muslim , the western books have been col@@ oni@@ ze for centuries . &quot;
this temp@@ ting image language is determined by the dark man who should fear and the exotic woman that should res@@ cue .
the pi@@ on@@ eering Palestinian scientists Edward S@@ aid in the 19@@ 70s wrote the story behind these pictures .
but these pictures will also be beyond today .
&quot; our politicians , the news and Hollywood continues to cont@@ end them . &quot;
&quot; I have worked for thir@@ teen years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful , lack@@ ing Nar@@ rative our news@@ fe@@ eds . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ rative sur@@ passed the reality , which has led nine Muslim men to have led their countries during the last three decades while the US could not even choose its first female Pres@@ idency . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ rative fa@@ ils to ack@@ n@@ owledge that when French , Muslim men to wear in public buildings and Saudi Arabia , Muslim men by their government to cover their entire body , these are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
&quot; a powerful group exercis@@ ed its &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; to the &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this strong Nar@@ rative we@@ aker , we@@ alth@@ y women , the movements of change . &quot;
&quot; it looks across that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil of Afri@@ kan@@ ers , have been brought so far with sla@@ ve . &quot;
it delet@@ es the existence of Que@@ er @-@ Muslim .
this Nar@@ rati@@ vely has occupied our collective imagination . it is often occupied by Si@@ kh @-@ men and children to the aim of anti @-@ tim@@ icro@@ bi@@ ble attacks and fic@@ tions .
&quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell , is Islam@@ op@@ hobia today not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
among the 1.7 billion
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than just stories to tell the facts are based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ rative that help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to realize the Nar@@ rative of the 1.7 billion .
and here we have failed to spend the seven million Muslims in the highest degree of &quot; diverse &quot; religious group in America .
more than one third of the whole Muslim population are African Americans are African Americans .
&quot; six of ten American Muslims belong to the imm@@ ig@@ rants of the first generation , which are from 77 countries . &quot;
the parents of the author in 1976 in New York .
usage approved .
four decades ago my lon@@ ely parents came to live in New York to live their American dream .
&quot; my mother laid their first jewelry design on 5th Avenue before and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scrap@@ ers of New York , sky@@ scrap@@ ers , made of Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; back then , when Khan were re@@ covered the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were ir@@ reversible Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but I am now irre@@ voc@@ able Muslim and American ?
&quot; sometimes when I ask for people why I say no por@@ k , I say - instead of my mus@@ lim@@ ous recipes , or my hand@@ ful spending money , which all Muslims involved in itself - &quot; from respect to P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
&quot; I pleas@@ ures , we do not wear all spending with us . &quot;
we must also be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to almost always be chosen for additional safety checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim ac@@ tivi@@ sts and inter@@ religious ac@@ tivi@@ sts who stri@@ ve to fight far spread lies about Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced in the ongoing volume of a well curved Islam@@ ist , t@@ ink Tanks and experts for Fal@@ und@@ information which is our already faul@@ ty image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manip@@ ulated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of the way , in which we tell it , there is Islam@@ op@@ hobia in more than just a for@@ eig@@ ner that made a woman the head@@ sc@@ arf . &quot;
&quot; or as the sc@@ ary map of att@@ acked on mos@@ ques in the whole USA , see below . &quot;

Islam@@ ic@@ ity in its ug@@ ly forms is att@@ ending our affili@@ ation .

usage approved .
I want to explain that .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim but a Muslim was born only when I was four years old , in a pro@@ visional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian Church in New York . &quot;
&quot; as social scienti@@ st religious life describe them back on the following terms : faith , behavior and belonging . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behavior are perhaps not always visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; maybe my girlfriend would see my neigh@@ bor , my neigh@@ bor to see my rock in the sur@@ f that I am Muslim if they could separate through the 15 meters of concrete and air to separate our houses . &quot;
she would see the sole rit@@ ual with my daughter when I fle@@ e them into my poor cra@@ dle and her the Arab promises to defeat the Koran and the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that it is protected from evil , evil that you can see and evil that you cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim belief is possibly not always visible , but my mus@@ lim@@ ical strain is always part of my shadow . &quot;

belonging to my grand@@ mother is the image of my grand@@ mother mat@@ ern@@ ity with their sisters ; as they win a competition in the art of the Blumen@@ arranged in Kar@@ achi .
&quot; it is the image of her that I see in this moment when I close my eyes : Nano , surrounded by its full @-@ end@@ anger@@ ed paintings , and one cor@@ ans with many book@@ marks , a book with a hundred and four@@ teen chapters that can be virtually in@@ clin@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; Muslim means to be the prayers that she said to me , when I have a bad day . &quot;
&quot; that Muslim has to be brought in it as she has brought me to God : Allah , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people , that - through centuries - through a &quot; &quot; imperi@@ um &quot; &quot; was founded by a &quot; &quot; emp@@ ire &quot; &quot; which has established a company with the name hon@@ orary British Eu@@ ini@@ ums @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep meaning to call God , my only Lord . &quot;

&quot; pause , while he writes books on modern Islam and over the independence s , w@@ ept N@@ ana Ja@@ an un@@ mist@@ ress around his family in India and lam@@ ely ash@@ mir , family that he was not allowed in his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; belonging to knowledge is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , as with my grand@@ father , of col@@ oni@@ alists have been dealt with , who have shared the Muslim world as at the game . &quot;
&quot; Muslim to be to know that in the last two centuries , Europeans all have to col@@ oni@@ zed all to four Muslim lands . &quot;
it means to know that the first fli@@ er bom@@ b history was thro@@ wn out above a Muslim land in front of a Muslim country .
&quot; it means to know that at the same time the grand@@ father of my grand@@ mother , a Indian , k@@ ick@@ ed subj@@ ection of the British Empire , was called &quot; dangerous &quot; because he led the first mosque in England . &quot;
&quot; even before it existed , he trav@@ elled to more parts of the world than I ever was and pre@@ ached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

&quot; to my mus@@ lim@@ ian strain of 1,@@ 7 billion , go deep into our unforgettable family rooms ; our un@@ cat@@ chy history . &quot;
&quot; it means to remember that four years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops that have been distributed over every continent apart from the Antarc@@ tic , who have gone through mass destruction , which did not exist . &quot;
it means to know that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ ers are buried in the ruins of the war .
an American Muslim to be to know that the self @-@ ass@@ ass@@ ate has ris@@ en under Veter@@ ans since 2001 to more than 32 percent .
&quot; it means to know that when a trag@@ edy the US is pos@@ ing and the sus@@ pic@@ ion of a Muslim name carries , the history of four times more reports is reported as a story with a white attack . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that four@@ teen years ago the first prayer @-@ call , the A@@ za@@ an , was called by a free black sl@@ aves with the name Bil@@ al . &quot;
it means to know that two hundred years ago an African Islam@@ ist named Bil@@ ali Muhammad sm@@ ells and brought into this country .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X a American hero .
&quot; it is the heat that I door , when people were over the airports to fight against the Muslim B@@ an . &quot;
it is the hope that I feel when we stand for our dreams and when we say black lives .
&quot; an American lady , a p@@ ah@@ ari , a p@@ ah@@ ari , a p@@ ah@@ ari , a Muslim Br@@ abi , a Muslim and a journ@@ alist means to fail , the in@@ fi@@ ery inter @-@ sec@@ tional identi@@ ties , but to fail to others to others . &quot;
&quot; Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1,@@ 7 billion has more possibilities than a magic cu@@ bes , but is represented in the reduced branch &quot; &quot; we &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a mother to be a mother , to care for my child and all the Muslim children , well @-@ knowing that powerful and privileged persons in this branch of structural Islam@@ ic@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; structural Islam@@ op@@ hobia consists of the Muslim regist@@ rations , which began with President Bush and conducted under President Obama . &quot;
it consists in the usual supervision of mos@@ ques .
&quot; it consists in the imm@@ igration , which takes a five year old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
&quot; it consists in a country that clos@@ es its borders to people from just the countries , which it bom@@ bar@@ ded . &quot;
&quot; it is a false and neb@@ ul@@ ous &quot; No @-@ Fly @-@ List , &quot; which is largely Arabs and Muslims . &quot;
they are the wars that we lead and the bom@@ bs that we cast on Muslim lands .
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those we do not tell , we are today here . &quot;
&quot; in a study with the title A@@ scent of Man , scientists in the North@@ western University of participants showed a scienti@@ fic@@ ally un@@ real image and b@@ aten them , groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution . &quot;
Muslims received the low@@ est score .
the con@@ vers@@ ations we have to lead
&quot; we are too deep , a ger@@ mination , the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
we have decades back to recognis@@ e the roots of our f@@ ears and the lack of dangerous and dangerous expression that we get involved in our News@@ archive .
&quot; at least , there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , which tries to capture our many multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot;
&quot; the pod@@ cast Som@@ ething , S@@ ay Som@@ ething of Bu@@ zz@@ Bu@@ lim@@ Muslim ; the vi@@ ral vide@@ os@@ erie Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square over black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative , multip@@ lied , Muslim , American Super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope . &quot;

&quot; but I am concerned due to this difficult global period , in which we are in . &quot;
and that time has consequences that go out over the 1.7 billion .
&quot; there is one reason that conspir@@ acy theore@@ ticians who had existed in the dark cor@@ ners of the Internet , now the White House is now lead . &quot;
they have grown ex@@ pon@@ entially since they have made Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; there is another group that has grown ex@@ pon@@ entially by moving the &quot; &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a few years ago she had not yet been given them ; now they domin@@ ate large areas in Syria and Iraq .
&quot; I am concerned about the re@@ alities and history , which I was not aware of what I was as old now , but now I was my daughter , but who made me to an un@@ emb@@ assy Muslim . &quot;
things I left here like a bread@@ cru@@ ise in my speech .
&quot; things that maybe memories w@@ sta@@ ins , because in all the inter@@ sections which our humanity makes a story loud , where someone becomes a &quot; &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley Kon@@ vers@@ ations will take place during the 8th annual conference on Islam@@ op@@ hobia . &quot;
&quot; more than a hundred academ@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; &quot; others &quot; , &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not a terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or who we read in our newspapers .

we all need to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; so I tell the here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where yet Edward S@@ aid , the man who has shown us as wars will be guided and people by the work of the &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; in public not@@ ion , four decades ago scienti@@ st the Stan@@ ford . &quot;
&quot; we have to worry about the role of aware , aware and un@@ aware of the &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; as it is my girlfriend and I like in rain during the Women &apos;s March , because he had no president , the Cho@@ colate sl@@ ums , while he already claimed the invisible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .

&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) , the count of stories in their original language is the possible answer to it . &quot;
&quot; Global Vo@@ ices told about another initiative of Steven Bird , the inv@@ ac@@ able blog . &quot;
&quot; however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to obtain the language diversity of major cities and to worthy . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land , where T@@ LS has been carried out since 2015 events , the risk that small and not quite as small languages do not be handed over to those born child . &quot;
for the makers of the project is valid :
&quot; the mass mort@@ ar of the languages of the world can be avo@@ ided , when we create cities , the diversity accept - safe areas where people must not forget about who they are to belong . &quot;
&quot; while listening is often connected to it , &quot; &quot; don &apos;t understand these events instead , &quot; &quot; listen to value , to feel who make up . &quot;
&quot; in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers have first written in their own language in their own language , and then explain them in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , so they lead their dev@@ otion and their presentation that the listen@@ ering can rely on it . &quot;
they call lau@@ gh and emotions when the language no longer a bar@@ rier .
&quot; the following video shows such a traditional history of Burkina Faso , which will be told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round the stor@@ yt@@ eller in R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate is also the opportunity to explain to their land typical customs of employment . &quot;
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the F@@ abel from the ha@@ en and the P@@ avian in the language Sh@@ ona Zimbabwe :
&quot; after having explained the meaning of his f@@ abel , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to speak to an audience that your language not under@@ stands ? &quot; with a broad smile , he shares his feeling of inclu@@ siveness : &quot;
you have heard !
you were attentive ...
they were completely with me !
&quot; hi@@ ther@@ to have found the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling in three cities , and the organiz@@ ers hope to expand this . all who are inspired by the project , can be in contact with T@@ LS , in order to organ@@ ise their own lay@@ outs . &quot;
Puerto Rico calls for the United States from the United States
&quot; with the aim of a re@@ cour@@ aging public debt from Puerto Rico , who grew up to 72 million US dollars , participating in the pu@@ ph@@ onic Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and ran until the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans . &quot;
it was called by the group@@ ing &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la D@@ eu@@ da &quot; ( German Front for the neur@@ ons of debt ) and the Church of Puerto Ri@@ cos .
the inter@@ cess@@ ors of the re@@ mission of debt also submitted a peti@@ tion on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their requirement :
&quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos calls that politicians , b@@ än@@ ker and government agencies responsible for debt must be held responsible for their cor@@ rupt . &quot;
&quot; we call for financial examination and a conduc@@ tivity without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions of the re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot;
we will be pres@@ ses and supp@@ ressed .
&quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos wei@@ g@@ hed to pay a debt , which is not its . &quot;
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not be found with sin@@ king pension .
we demand immediate policies .
the island - not into the state of the area of the United States - suff@@ ers under a heavy financial crisis .
&quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy &quot; , &quot; a rule @-@ independent non @-@ profit organization with a focus on soci@@ o @-@ economic development , a law to pro@@ position as an alternative to the existing citizen . &quot;
these are their reasons :
economic and financial crisis in Puerto Ri@@ cos requires a wide re@@ struc@@ turing of state infrastructure .
&quot; from outside impos@@ ed measures are being impos@@ ed without the participation and con@@ vic@@ tion of citizens &apos; risk , to be det@@ ected by the people . &quot;

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian company @-@ developer bas@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been mixed for over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; over five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regi@@ mes , his suppor@@ ters and relatives the campaign for his freedom and remember the posts which he has done for an open network . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s re : publi@@ ca , the annual conference held at the digital culture , which is dedicated to Berlin dedicated to an event of the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign . &quot;
&quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scienti@@ st in France res@@ ident CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , managing books in three to five days , las@@ es excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collective In@@ quiry ( The cost of freedom : a collective investigation ) . &quot;
&quot; the book that has been published last year and is available here , contains a number of applications that deal with free culture in the face of the op@@ pression . &quot;
it is an hom@@ age to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it is called :
&quot; this book would like to be built , how moves for free knowledge and what the real costs are associated with which this is connected . &quot;
&quot; ac@@ tivi@@ sts , artist , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for Free knowledge , have a page on site to view over the fo@@ g , which gives up our news@@ fe@@ eds and to create something about our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and che@@ et@@ ched Internet volunte@@ ers who has been in Syria since the 15th of March 2012 . &quot;
his name was painted from the directory of the Ad@@ ra pris@@ oner in which he was sat on 3 October 2015 .
we have no information about its current state or where@@ ab@@ outs .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title of collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice which will be on his release and want to know him back in his normal life and freedom .
&quot; to see how b@@ ass@@ el paid a high price for participation in a free culture , many of us start to think about their own destiny , de@@ eds and decisions . &quot;
why are we today here ?
what have we decided ?
what do we have abandoned in this process of time @-@ wise bel@@ iefs ?
the web@@ developer for Open Source and Digital activ@@ ist has been in the port of Syrian government since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 Bass@@ el was transferred from the Ad@@ ra prison , a non @-@ military de@@ cor to an unknown place . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and law@@ yer N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; military police Bass@@ ano reported on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; of the military gr@@ ated from his cell in Ad@@ ra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi was reported that she was contacted by people who stood by people themselves as the in@@ sider of the Assad &apos;s government and to contact them from an all@@ eged dead@@ lock against their husband .
its where@@ ab@@ outs and condition remain unknown .
&quot; a pione@@ er of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in it to expand access to the Internet and knowledge of the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry For@@ w , a designer , technology and currently exc@@ es@@ sive the leader of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
perhaps none of the basic cultural prot@@ otypes were predic@@ ted as the work that he began with a group of arch@@ e@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins Pal@@ my@@ ras .
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important arch@@ e@@ ological sites in the world , the path@@ way numerous civili@@ z@@ ations and here merge Greek @-@ ro@@ man architecture with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; Bass@@ el was back then not know that ten years after having started working with this work , the IS would place all that architecture that not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world em@@ bo@@ died . &quot;
&quot; this strip into the digital arch@@ e@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule , which will be valu@@ ed for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future . &quot;
&quot; trag@@ ically , Bass@@ ano could not yet shut down this project until now . &quot;
&quot; N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband , his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison , &quot;
&quot; I have spent my personal life to dream , from freedom to dream and bas@@ el taught me to emb@@ race her . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el brought me English at even when he was already in cust@@ ody .
I learned to read English good to write and speak English .
&quot; he has always been his knowledge with any shared , who has asked . he has taught others to read English , write English and speak to speak . &quot;
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computer and smartphones .
he brought me the Internet at .
&quot; he has also imp@@ ris@@ oned others as they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without that they actually stopped one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( War@@ ten ) , a pro@@ sab@@ bath , which she wrote in the years 2012 until the end of 2012 , when he was in cust@@ ody . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ oura have worked together in the book together in the book .
they decor@@ ate the texts to him when they visited him and he over@@ sat them from the Arabic .

&quot; that in the world of your charming eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose the meditation in the moment , in which we emb@@ race us , &quot;

basic story is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the prot@@ ests 2011 against the regime Bas@@ har al @-@ Ass@@ ads are loud , according to Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian network for human rights ) more than 65@@ 0,000 people . &quot;
those who were arrested or imp@@ acted by the regime by the regime were tort@@ ured or even executed .
&quot; until 2016 , since 2011 have died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Sy@@ rer in Haf@@ t since 2011 . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
we repeat the demand in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Mozambique : because of the corruption of condem@@ n Director pursu@@ ing to the prison on the post
Mos@@ ambique re@@ acted with anger on a cor@@ rupt case in which a government member was returned to the workplace of the state appar@@ atus in which the corruption was committed in the state .
&quot; this was arrested by Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , the 2008 and was judged in 2010 with four other def@@ endants of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( about 800 000 Euro ) to 22 years imp@@ ris@@ on@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; the money proce@@ eds from public funds from Mozambique , whose Council Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 board . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of good guidance and called for immediately his re @-@ setting in the company , which was on April 19 . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with an opinion of the general rule of law of the Republic , which caused the application for Cam@@ b@@ aza , there would be no more obstacles for Cam@@ b@@ aza , since the company was no discipline . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants are not good . &quot;
&quot; the centre for public integrity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca , short CIP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , condem@@ ned in an interview with the German wave The decision of the company , the director again : &quot;
&quot; represents a backl@@ ash in the fight against corruption , and clearly the absence of transparency and is even a back@@ step with regard to the efforts of our legal system , so the CIP . &quot;
what we take note that the company should have a discipl@@ in@@ arity against the ref@@ rain .
the company was apparently but apparently no appropriate legal steps for the application of the appropriate functions .
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio U@@ Z , a significant voice in the Mos@@ ambique social media , ref@@ utes this behavior also and consi@@ ders the case as a &quot; res@@ ident &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ b@@ aza would be a competent type , he would be a consultant when he was sent@@ enced to a sentence . &quot;
&quot; he could hold numerous lectures and motiv@@ ating speech@@ es , he could advise and his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he has been fully integrated into the company that he helped any damage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza is gladly paid for its silence . &quot;
# { el@@ ap@@ sed }
&quot; bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political sciences in Brazil says , the Director had no mor@@ ality : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza from the state re@@ war@@ ded , because he did not believe him that one has re@@ war@@ ded someone in such way that the state has already had so massive . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza l@@ acks the mor@@ ality return and serve the state , * He had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead it was only served by the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state , as hand@@ ele it became tired of an in@@ ex@@ haus@@ tible source of source and the state itself , the man has tired and finally led to a long sentence . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ est@@ ly said , I do not know why this man was re@@ war@@ ded . &quot;
&quot; Fran@@ c@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te preferred it to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remember that a th@@ ief is in prison . &quot;
&quot; they belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el will not only be remember@@ ed to the Mos@@ ambique , but also as a sharp president , but also as a sharp , divi@@ der and - next - proph@@ etic speakers . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous in@@ flam@@ mat@@ ory depic@@ tions was when he was energe@@ tic to be able that &quot; &quot; an ambitious man is capable of all , also the fa@@ ther@@ land for its ambi@@ tions , its own individual interest to sell . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; &quot; I know not whether a ambitious man changes , my experience shows that which is not so . he changes the tac@@ tics , but he does not change from his ambi@@ tions . &quot;
an ambitious man is at the same time cri@@ minal . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also decl@@ ining :
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was sent@@ enced to 22 years in prison , he sat 10 years and came free . &quot;
&quot; and today it puts him the company , in which he fell in un@@ faithful , back under contract . # Assi@@ m@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - acci@@ dental @ quer@@ ky location ( @ az@@ mal _ ra@@ fik ) 12 May 2017

Facebook block@@ ed the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and c@@ ens@@ ored many users too wrong
the bur@@ ial word &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; means K@@ ich@@ er@@ erb@@ se or Sp@@ age .

&quot; according to the details of Facebook users in Myanmar , the well known social network took their posts from the net , because it did the word &quot; cal@@ ar . &quot; &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people ost@@ indi@@ an origin or generally referred to as ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; indi@@ an &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Facebook st@@ ressed the word &quot; cal@@ ar &quot; or the land@@ mark of the location ( in bur@@ ial scrip@@ ture ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widely used problem of the H@@ ass@@ ette in Burma during social network .
in recent years the rise has given rise to radical national movements to the word an extremely ab@@ este@@ em notation .
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by Ultra @-@ nation@@ alist as H@@ ass@@ ol against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in the effort to fight shar@@ ec@@ tos in Burma , the company has c@@ ens@@ ored a lot of mean@@ ing@@ ful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; Kal@@ ar &apos;@@ mag is usually associated with rac@@ ism , but the word itself does not call automatically . &quot;
&quot; context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that also , in which they have discussed the use of the word or have dou@@ bts about the purpose of his use . &quot;
&quot; beyond , there are several bur@@ ial words with basics of mean@@ ings that have the same letter as &quot; cal@@ ar . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for example , chair is also written on &quot; &quot; kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &quot; , &quot; which contains the same letters , as well as other words such as &quot; kal@@ ar PA@@ E &apos; ( Sp@@ alter@@ b@@ se ) , &apos; kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( cur@@ tain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eboo@@ bs@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post one of my friends has been deleted today because he contained the word cal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he had asked his friends on spiritual way if he could we@@ aken his back pain , as he made his back pain . &quot;
&quot; the sentence ku la - &quot; &quot; Healing &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + the Fr@@ age@@ word ( la ) on price res@@ em@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were several reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; Z@@ in Win is the opinion that they will decrease the radical nation , but also that Facebook analytical might be mine , before there is all records , which spread in sus@@ pic@@ ion , rac@@ ism . &quot;
Facebook delet@@ es the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; does not manually .
it filter@@ ed the word automatically .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Automatic will not understand what you are doing at Fac@@ e@@ ook . &quot;
&quot; what it should be instead , the post is carefully to analy@@ ze and control him by chec@@ king the words below . &quot;
&quot; for example &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; ( Sp@@ alter@@ b@@ sen ) . &quot;
&quot; the good is that these dre@@ ck@@ ed nation@@ alists , spread the line @-@ language , a pretty good lesson . &quot;
&quot; now it is time to circum@@ cis@@ ed their nation@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to all , the clu@@ sters address , the efficiency of this strategy may not take long time . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ chat have proven that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of keywords often is a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are easy to start to express a new word or alternative writing of the zen@@ ed word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described , as Facebook began to clear his posts , when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &quot; cal@@ ar &quot; of social network is b@@ anned : &quot;
... &quot; when I was attentive to this new Directive of Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook @-@ friends that the word is block@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post office is removed from Facebook and me the light , poetry and parts of content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; Facebook Community Standards was not de@@ ed . &quot;
Facebook has a lot of posts of people who have no negative inten@@ tions or who simply try to demonstrate their opinions against the H@@ ass@@ el radical nation .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his mail has been removed nothing to do with H@@ ass@@ ette :
post without h@@ ass@@ ing from Facebook .
in the post the author particip@@ ates his opinion of why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are poor@@ ly .
Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the beginning of the initiative for example the bur@@ ial internet community in order to ask advice :
&quot; Facebook may have a prosper@@ ous intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma by its platform , but it does not work . &quot;
such words to Zen@@ ise will only bring more h@@ ate within the various communities .
&quot; in addition , it appears as if they have started with no local context or technical support and have forbidden to have such words such as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out they have made mistakes , they did not tried to at@@ tain the sus@@ pic@@ ion sol@@ dered posts . &quot;
&quot; if they would only have something more respect for the 15 million benefit , which would make them a great sales , it would be great . &quot;
facts automatic c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship has en@@ sured for a lot of b@@ lot under users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now make yourself about Facebook funny and write the word &apos; cal@@ ar &apos; do not be seen in the context of H@@ ass@@ ette , to see whether their records from the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook @-@ posts , which were no longer found yet , but nevertheless removed : &quot;
with permission .
the Burm@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch a pe@@ ar cur@@ ry and watch a Indian movie .
just to try whether Facebook is the post that contains the word cal@@ ar .

&quot; in the last five years extreme nation@@ alistic ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists , social networks used to have their voices and their influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , H@@ ass@@ ette in social networks should also use violence in Myanmar in addition , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disp@@ utes between Muslim and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have been forced to escape . &quot;
Facebook has been responsible for his failure to get the pron@@ ounc@@ ed H@@ ass@@ lands on its bur@@ ial pages under control .
&quot; but rather than simply the word &quot; cal@@ ar &quot; too , it would have been better than in context than on code focused initiatives and learned from them . &quot;

children &apos;s children is in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now illeg@@ ally .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 the Parliament of the country agreed upon a law to offer this practice , so that the married age now is at 18 . &quot;
&quot; prior to this change of the sp@@ ouse , some members of the du@@ istic and Muslim religious communities . at that time , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aja , the leader of the Inter@@ religious organization ( IR@@ O ) , a group , the representatives of the various religious groups of the country gathered that the state does not agree , as that , age not the matur@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; this happened regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a business meeting of the UN Security Council , the minority is in the age of 18 years . &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who have been married with 15 already in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago 2.8 percent , and with 18 it was 8.@@ 1 percent . &quot;
2011 confirmed the statistical Central of the country that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 .
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social @-@ media movements , which were passed , laws to children , followed by the foot and were great support . undoubtedly hal@@ ves them to bring this result . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smooth@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; a Hind@@ u leader , such as had no concerns , the cri@@ tics of children &apos;s children , they should be mist@@ aken in order to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition sor@@ row@@ ed for ten@@ sions in this actually un@@ complicated thing , and some point out doubt whether the opposition would agree to the law of law@@ yer . &quot;
&quot; yet at the beginning of 2017 , the legis@@ lat@@ ure was decided against the children - despite 4 Sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent that could be discussed , so that he could be discussed in the representative office where a simple majority would make him a law . &quot;
&quot; now , only the President of the country has to agree with the law . &quot;
one of the Sen@@ ators of the country gave me a status update on Facebook the Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agram again :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the draft law against the children &apos;s office was in the representative house with 35 votes for this and no one against it .
&quot; after he was decided in the Senate , the draft may now become the law . &quot;
the majority of social @-@ media users was enthusiastic because the laws of children had finally been changed .
Facebook @-@ member Lov@@ ell Francis , who is a Prime Minister in the Education Ministry , said : &quot;
&quot; it has too much time and un@@ necessary straight , that has the core of the matter , but you know what ? the children is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now , and this is almost every price . &quot;
&quot; during A@@ bel Jackson of opinion , it was definitely long enough to create the practice , Lara Qu@@ in@@ all @-@ Thomas was happy that the day came finally : &quot;
&quot; public status update on Facebook by Lara Qu@@ in@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , , Her@@ for@@ rag@@ ging news ! &quot;
the sp@@ ouse has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for this - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , who listen@@ ed to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society that spoke open@@ ly about it , how important the adoption of the law was : &quot;
the married age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now ir@@ respective of the den@@ omin@@ ations 18 years .
&quot; the design to change the sp@@ ouse was today , on 9 June 2017 , decided . &quot;
&quot; in the example house , there are 41 members of members and of which were at least 35 during the vote . &quot;
&quot; all members , who were opposed to the law have agreed . &quot;
children &apos;s children is not allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ mar@@ ri@@ ag@@ ei@@ tor@@ tie .

&quot; but a possible h@@ ooks comes in the form of sat Mahar@@ aja , the Secretary General of the San@@ at@@ an Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hind@@ u organization of the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago , Mahar@@ aja will pro@@ claim his intention to take legal steps , the law should be adopted , and he seems to be a promise now . &quot;
&quot; during the general state of stat@@ us@@ or Paris Al R@@ awi , a supp@@ orter of the law , said it was right@@ ly , if Mahar@@ aja fighting against the law , most social @-@ media users would turn the debate on the subject differently . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ r@@ ell suggested :
&quot; dear Sat , if we , instead of keeping the discussion so generally , in a way that the state , our daughters may be able to discuss the state in our bedroom , that they may be of great , hard @-@ long@@ ed men who are suffering from the problem , they would then be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think it is not a problem ?
&quot; but whether it comes to a judi@@ cial proceedings against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there is still places on the world where the children &apos;s children are legal or continue to be the norm , although there are laws that they say . &quot;

by mirr@@ ors of web pages you can view Turkish users back on Wikipedia content
&quot; Wikipedia Site was published on 18 January 2012 , related to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and PI@@ PA copyright laws in the USA , internationally well @-@ dark . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC BY @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month the Turkey block@@ ed the popular and on the Cro@@ w@@ ds@@ ourcing principle based enc@@ y@@ clopedia Wikipedia .
&quot; day by day is significant , how important the platform for users to find helpful and reliable information . &quot;
both students and repor@@ ter and fans of television series are fighting against the block@@ ing .
&quot; though many techniques used to use it used to use envelop@@ e tools for block@@ ed websites ( an active article from the New York Times on that Turkey has the third @-@ largest VPN pre@@ valence of the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been block@@ ed since 2008 articles from Wikipedia , as recently in an published report by the Berk@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Har@@ v@@ ard University since 2007 , after the internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;
&quot; according to China , Turkey is the most known country in the world when it comes to the massive cen@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform continues to be locked , there are several mirr@@ ors ( pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform put all Turkish Wikipedia on its de@@ centr@@ alized Peer @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. calcul@@ ator connection ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus a complete c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship is difficult . &quot;
the content is not available in spite of law .
in a blog post IP@@ FS on his efforts :
&quot; after we have heard the news ( via the block@@ ing of Wikipedia ) , we set everything to set snap@@ shots from Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . thus , there is the possibility to read the content on de@@ centr@@ alized and distributed . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to look at least any Wikipedia content , even if it cannot achieve the website www.@@ wikipedia.org itself . &quot;
IP@@ FS was also concluded that this step is independent of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation and it is only a screen@@ shots and no Live@@ - or dynamic versions of the website .
&quot; however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to move the sperm . &quot;
&quot; C@@ risti@@ an Con@@ son@@ ni from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a Mir@@ ror@@ site of Wikipedia , as well as Wik@@ i@@ Mirror , an open @-@ source project that everyone can be used to host similar mirr@@ ors when in the respective country Wikipedia is block@@ ed . &quot;
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices member as well as employee in the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open : &quot; Podcast :
&quot; it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy @-@ address , a Mirror . &quot;
&quot; one takes place on another URL , which is not the original . that what you can see is from Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; essentially the server leads the request to the right Wikipedia &apos;s side , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even then when it is locked in Turkey . &quot;
because this is executed by a server which is not in Turkey .
a ne@@ pal@@ ic Wild@@ tier@@ fot@@ ogra@@ f uses its camera to make attention to the need for nature conservation
&quot; a su@@ v@@ ant N@@ ash@@ orn , Ch@@ it@@ wan . &quot;
photo of Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
with permission .
&quot; Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he looked around him , never satisfied . they were sc@@ ur@@ red with bad@@ ly positioned moti@@ fs and balanced colors . &quot;
the motiv@@ ated him even a camera to wear and try to get the situation .
then he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , he tries to bring Sag@@ ar , Nep@@ as wild@@ life to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his homeland is right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offering it the perfect opportunity to shoot photos , bringing the attention to Nep@@ as wild@@ life . &quot;
he described on Facebook as it helps him the first @-@ class position in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Parks in a world heritage . what could it give better for a passionate wild@@ life ! !
I rested at home when I suddenly called Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan Ga@@ ida Lodge ) . he had given an call from my Father that on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river a le@@ op@@ ard would be le@@ op@@ ard .
the river@@ dam@@ m is just a few minutes from the tourist town of S@@ aur@@ aha .
immediately I ran out with my camera and was there in a few minutes there .
&quot; my father had seen him and showed me the place on the other river , where the le@@ op@@ ard found and I immediately started with it , pictures to kne@@ es ! ! &quot;
&quot; Sag@@ ar aims to acquire a collaboration with the authorities to acquire global recognition for Nep@@ as nature and would like to understand the understanding of it that wild animals are not so terrible as they look like . &quot;
&quot; and he should know it , for he rose tig@@ ers already from face faces : &quot;
a tiger can not be seen from the opinion of the sheep during sleep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was due to the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ he@@ ater appeared . he immediately sit down , we see ourselves and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar the logo &quot; I click for &quot; &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
but his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ as nature and wild is not always easy .
&quot; he wa@@ ited 22 days long , and lived in a tent to make in the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days it took a tiger to photograp@@ h and six to seven days for the perfect picture of birds that live close to the tourist information . &quot;
see below some of these photos .

this article was written by Kay@@ on@@ aa@@ z Kal@@ yan@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Volunteers , an award @-@ winning international community organisation from India . &quot;
a re@@ vised version was once again published as part of a Content @-@ sharing Agreement .
in many parts of India there are women with ut@@ most care to speak the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
instead they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &apos; father of my child .
&quot; by Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ as@@ ht@@ ra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect that they should respect to the social pressure in the husband , as well as the fear of the consequences they should receive the norm to the norm . &quot;
&quot; last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was sent@@ enced to the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a , and condem@@ ned by her family and the village of the village , after they had stopped their relatives by name . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of their wives are also not con@@ fron@@ ted by the name , is also among men spread . however , they have much less assign@@ ments to fear , if at all , they should not fall into practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ as@@ ht@@ ra , tr@@ aten nine women , including Health sper@@ son@@ al as well as house@@ wives , a unique club at and thus quickly became the main mar@@ gin@@ al theme of the city . &quot;
&quot; it is a place only for them alone , where they can discuss the enemies of the patri@@ archy . &quot;
&quot; as one of 56 clubs , which there is in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ ef@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and is involved in the super@@ structure of the patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ hini Pa@@ was for seven years with the help of their video camera on the use of practices such as children &apos;s rat up to the compos@@ ing of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and guides these clubs . &quot;
she reported how this cra@@ b created a safe place for these women and have made it at the same time a sou@@ venir inside of the wall .
&quot; the first video , the Ro@@ hini showed in their discussion , hand@@ led by women who did not call her husband . &quot;
she decided for this issue because they wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which the women can easily identify with .
&quot; the name of their hus@@ bands will not be loud to speak , is a bre@@ wing that they maintain all over and never asked questions . &quot;
subject :
this tradition confirms that a woman resp@@ ects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who do not consi@@ ders this is regarded as a res@@ c@@ ic@@ le as a woman without mor@@ ality .
the tradition is so deeply ro@@ oted for us to this discussion has never been thought about it .
&quot; at the beginning , Ro@@ hini wanted to try her husband , so far before the name had never seen at home , as it runs . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion with her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Ro@@ hini tells :
&quot; my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband were still long , after the video was at the end . &quot;
&quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I should call him from now on his name . &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage out@@ launched its first discussion .
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women . &quot;
at the beginning of the round Ro@@ hini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the vide@@ opro@@ j@@ ection the women to bring discussion with a exercise in motion .
&quot; Ro@@ hini asked every participant to say the name of their husband , with various feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving , and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked all , &quot; If we cannot say the name of our husband , but they can call us how they want , meaning that they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it be not equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of her husband over the lips , &quot; says Ro@@ hini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ as@@ ht@@ ra over the board@@ room of a century @-@ old tradition , in the married women must never pron@@ o@@ unce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Ro@@ hini tells :
&quot; a woman was so sh@@ y that they only came out during the whole exercise , a different decided to find out the whole ang@@ ent fru@@ stration against him and his family by taking him . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ek@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; still in ad@@ ren@@ aline , with an ancient bre@@ ach , the women decided that they would actually try at home to call their hus@@ bands . &quot;
and they stopped their word .
in the next days Ro@@ hini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Ro@@ hini and asked what ideas they put in the head : his wife could not ce@@ ase to say his name .
another K@@ lub@@ member has decided to do it with dinner in front of the entire family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she ten@@ se , she got afraid and said that there was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; Ro@@ hini review , I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a group in was less understanding and the situation art@@ ed in force .
&quot; Ro@@ hini reports how women tried to stop other practices , such as the mour@@ ning of the zin@@ easi@@ est point on the for@@ ehead , who is the sp@@ ouse : &quot;
why do only women have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would wear the cin@@ no@@ ber@@ red point if he also did .
he only lau@@ g@@ hed and I heard that to carry him .
&quot; the other women do not have completely heard this , but mean they are now in a better position , even to choose him on some days . &quot;
for many women the discussion is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; we do a trip with every discussion .
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; I do not want to worry about the women who could hear what could hear , &quot; says she . &quot;
&quot; during the last few months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they d@@ anced and other things about things that they had never been thought of thought . &quot;
subject :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I also have some things , for example as our identi@@ ties are kn@@ ot@@ ted , never been honest . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to say certain things according to say , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
in a discussion we have enter@@ tained us through the concept of honor and how to deal with clothes .
some women in the group have only been carried in the group since their Savi@@ or .
&quot; for most of them , the okay , but some wanted to carry a Sal@@ a Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt above a h@@ osis ; they did not move . &quot;
&quot; after much argument and discussion on the advantages of their own wardrobe , mor@@ ality associated with the Sar@@ is and much more , dirty Ro@@ hini gave her own pair of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) in a discussion , so that women could carry them . &quot;
&quot; next , they decided to plan to plan a trip to Go@@ a with whom she can wear je@@ ans and Ro@@ hini is certain that they can create it . &quot;
&quot; back to the question , whether in the five months have been changed since its first discussion , Ro@@ hini confirms that things are slowly becoming the roles : &quot;
so far we have made only small steps .
&quot; some women pro@@ found it a few times , but then listen to the name of their husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , do not make it yet , but only when they are alone and no other family members are involved . &quot;
only one or two say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women are contribut@@ ing at any time interest in their for@@ ehead .
&quot; the women in the panel know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives , like the fic@@ tion of more freedom of movement or its own wardrobe - at the end of a difficult to navig@@ ate river . &quot;
&quot; by offering each other self @-@ confidence , will become conscious that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Ro@@ hini explains :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am too .
&quot; but this club gives each of us the confidence , that something is to change . &quot;
&quot; and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families , if every woman goes home in the club home and other people of it , what we talk and what we do . &quot;
we are all sitting in the same boat .

Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may be fool@@ ish since Singapore is recognized as an independent state .
&quot; but according to the Jus@@ tin minister K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , Singapore should be regarded as a city . &quot;
this remark has trig@@ ger@@ ed in the blog@@ osph@@ ere .
&quot; during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the International Trade Association of the State of New York , the minist@@ ers of the only political party was cri@@ tici@@ zed by Singapore , because they are compared to Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he endor@@ se that Singapore should be regarded as a city .
nobody asked whether New York has a democracy ...
this is where most people want to commit a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o acc@@ used the Jus@@ tin minister , &quot; &quot; the logic of logic &quot; to defend the existing author@@ it@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , according to all our efforts and con@@ stru@@ cts to create this valuable country , you can tell us that we may finally be a country . &quot;
&quot; it was so vul@@ gar , it had the sight of a escape from the enti@@ ty , a compul@@ s@@ ory . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my land , eat country is then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons were not very no@@ bel : he def@@ ended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in the face of it , he appeared to be un@@ wei@@ rd und@@ em@@ ocr@@ atic . &quot;
&quot; he took the idea that Singapore with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York should be compared to equally cities , which are permanently managed by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; once one reaches the core item of the topic , the good old hear@@ ers broke out by the author@@ it@@ arian powers which give rise dem@@ ist@@ ocr@@ ats , as they adapt better to their power . &quot;
&quot; the end of the last week of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am were given answers to his American guests with regard to our press , our Judi@@ ci@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ answers . &quot;
corresponding questions tar@@ ned with non @-@ answers .
Rachel Z@@ eng demands Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am to pro@@ long@@ ed his opinion since it did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city is to which country is part of our city ... &quot;
&quot; hello , I understand nothing . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our wer@@ ter K Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am throw the effort to un@@ clari@@ fy this point , if he was paid up in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; by anon on the blog published his comment , he points concerning the cri@@ tics that one should begin to read the whole of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am better , according to whom Singapore was a city and no country . &quot;
read the scrip@@ tions .
&quot; he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; than a land , &quot; he stated why the elections in Singapore was so un@@ equal , even if we look forward to free and fair elections . &quot;
he toler@@ ate Singapore with cities in the US ( and how many of these cities saw a long thir@@ teenth to win a party ? ) .
&quot; he said , Singapore &quot; &quot; is not a land , he obviously does not have it in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his disappointment on Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , which makes a leader of a her@@ ent generation , such an pol@@ emic statement . &quot;
I am saying about what the Jus@@ tin minister has said to say very much ...
&quot; at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de , what I expect - be with them or not , but this is another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore , I have dou@@ bts and I am not even certain whether he really believes that he really are associated and aware of what he def@@ ends . &quot;
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review dis@@ lay the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ ly arguments :
&quot; did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am &quot; &quot; good@@ ying an error &quot; &quot; or was it a freel@@ ancer speaker ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we will only be seen as an independent and sover@@ eign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , on which country go back the sover@@ eign rights of the city of Singapore ? &quot;
Singapore is unique ; it is equally land and city .
&quot; as he plays an important role within the government of government , the statements by Mr Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am of serious meaning . &quot;
&quot; why do the soldiers apply their military service , but defend it only their city but not their land ? &quot;
who has to pay our Prime Minister to our Prime Minister ?
what is the value of our pink partner ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the magazine Jour@@ ney of a decade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and has always been a city : &quot;
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this sentence seems to have ru@@ led many cartridges ...
nobody ever told that Singapore is a country .
we always were a town .
we have always been a city / island of state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; def@@ ending the country above all &quot; &quot; etc . but that is not quite true . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defence of the city .

global Vo@@ ices asked about du@@ bit@@ ing his speakers : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ?
their answers will be published here as part of a ongoing line with the rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world and to be shown another fac@@ et .
&quot; the most recent part of this series dates from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question that is put to me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ?
&quot; no , I am sorry , I answered . &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and back in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on the situation the discussion will take place , it is considered polite , interest in his talk . &quot;
&quot; then in my clari@@ fications follows : &quot; &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice , nature . &quot; many Kan@@ adi@@ ans may be held intern@@ ally before w@@ ut if they are held for Americans , but I don &apos;t dist@@ ur@@ bed that . &quot;
&quot; for someone who does not know , there is little to distingu@@ ish the can@@ adi@@ ans of Americ@@ as . &quot;
&quot; this is one of the reasons why so many can@@ adi@@ ans bring a Canadian flag well visible on her back@@ pack when they travel . &quot;
all love Kan@@ adi@@ er .
http : / / nullrefer.com / ? https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? V = X@@
&quot; so it was for 20 years ago , when I began to travel through the world - before Donald Tru@@ mp , before the invasion of Iraq and the 11th of September . &quot;
Kan@@ adi@@ ans have always worn small hor@@ n@@ ets to their b@@ agg@@ age to differ from their American neighb@@ ours .
we have a free health care !
with us there is no weapons !
uniform E@@ hen are legally legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think Canada is so great .
we are polite .
&quot; obviously we say very often &quot; &quot; sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is also considered to be the toler@@ ant land towards ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Kan@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I h@@ ate this .
&quot; first , I have many American friends who I admire very wonderful . &quot;
it would make me nothing else if you would exchange me for example with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
there are also some problems with the stamp . &quot;
&quot; first , as &apos; nice &apos; means to be said , is basically , sp@@ ic@@ le to be - as the ben@@ ign , gentle , but trag@@ ically un@@ important figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has its own Canadian double de@@ cess@@ or ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really would be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no cor@@ ners and ed@@ ges , nothing , where you can encounter . &quot;
harm@@ less to be incon@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and no attention to deser@@ ve .
&quot; this can be something good , if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , fer@@ na@@ b of the things that are going to happen . &quot;
&quot; I would even go far as far as to say that the desire , free and alone , is a captain of the Can@@ adi@@ er . &quot;
we tend to take care of ourselves only to care of our own affairs .
what out@@ si@@ zing as &quot; nice &quot; means , maybe just cool courtesy . &quot;
Kan@@ adi@@ er do not often talk about the fence with the neighb@@ ours .
&quot; we lack the warm , open kindness , which I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
&quot; luck@@ ily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , the Jus@@ tin Tru@@ de@@ au entered the stage to show that Kan@@ adi@@ er are more than just &apos; nice . &quot;
music @-@ video of a Pop @-@ Band par@@ odi@@ zed Thailand &apos;s Jun@@ ta
&quot; one in Thailand famous pop @-@ band has released a musical video that the Jun@@ ta par@@ odi@@ ert , which 2014 re@@ produce the power and re @-@ restore the civi@@ lian government , continues to rule the country . &quot;
the new song &quot; DI@@ C@@ TA@@ TOR Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who told him his friend .
&quot; although not expressly politically , the Musik@@ video refers to the continued military domination of the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was described by many fans and other websites for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video of the song was a huge success .
&quot; only within the first three days , the video was divided on Facebook high @-@ made video 1.@@ 254 times and received 8.@@ 800 Li@@ kes . &quot;
in the past month the Charlie Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; The dict@@ ator was block@@ ed in Thailand after a group of ac@@ tivi@@ sts find out this video .
the video can be interpre@@ ted as a creative and entertaining introduction to the Thai policy to do so special about how it main@@ tains with the situation of the country under the j@@ ta rule .
&quot; look at this recording of the video , which refer to some of the political issues that have been pursu@@ ed to some of the political issues that have been pursu@@ ed to Thailand over the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; possibly refer to the dra@@ in section 44 of the pro@@ visional constitution , which is the Supreme Commander of the He@@ eres absolute decision making on important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the &quot; &quot; Settings &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , ac@@ tivi@@ sts , politicians , and other individuals who are considered by the j@@ ta as cri@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer cri@@ minal law , whose v@@ age and un@@ clear rules are often explo@@ ited by the authorities to be responsible for ac@@ tivi@@ sts and other cri@@ tics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose there was also a new unit set up in the army , the online content is monitor@@ ed and persons who pur@@ sues the mon@@ archy the mon@@ archy is persec@@ uted . &quot;
Thailand sets a strictly fr@@ y against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ est@@ or@@ offen@@ sive ) .
on 20 May 2014 the war was right in Thailand .
two days later it came to a put@@ sch of the army .
&quot; one of the problems continued to buy the j@@ ta is their decision expensive U @-@ boats , although vulner@@ abilities they war@@ n that the purchase is un@@ necessary and a waste of tax . &quot;
&quot; in the video even shown , as individuals will be thro@@ wn into a black wag@@ on before one brings them into an inter@@ ni@@ zation camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are sitting in prison , because they have been cultiv@@ ated &quot; confusion &quot; in society and internet pages , long sentence ; should they rank@@ ed the mon@@ archy . &quot;
meanwhile the teas@@ er showed the song members of the band called the Salu@@ t from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em &quot; im@@ it@@ ated who have already been used by Putin &apos;s opponents during the prot@@ ests in 2014 .

the post @-@ war society is only very slow in eastern Asia @-@ Asia especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al district .
&quot; over 20 years have passed since the Georgi@@ an @-@ ab@@ ch@@ astic war officially ended , but his sc@@ ars are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show distinc@@ tive pictures .
&quot; villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ ht@@ a , Poly@@ ana and Khar@@ chil@@ ava are located in the hydro@@ carb@@ ons of Ab@@ asi@@ as . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russi@@ ans , Gre@@ eks , ab@@ olition , Georgi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today most of Russi@@ ans and ab@@ b@@ bles live in the area .
such settlements are also called in waste @-@ Asia or ho@@ ster@@ cities .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period there still lived more than 10,000 people , today there are only a few hundred people in these viol@@ ations . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the distric@@ ts 16@@ ,000 people after she was hardly ris@@ en over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , about 43@@ .000 people lived in this district . &quot;

the buildings are falling and rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he starts a conversation and it falls it hard to end this .
&quot; it is all a consequence of war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
it is still clear . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , all of the community . &quot;
now there are only paved road with f@@ aded glory .
&quot; the people who once lived on this place and their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union , the district have now abandoned . &quot;
in the Gei@@ ster@@ stadt D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha live about fifty inhabitants .
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the Ch@@ ru@@ sch@@ ch@@ ow@@ kas that is still one or two families , you can recognize the balconies , where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
when they discover me with the camera in hand they immediately move back .
&quot; our mother is forbidden to make us photograp@@ h , &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she is simply forbidden to make it all . &quot;
the girl fle@@ es her girlfriend a little bit and suddenly they left the destroyed buildings and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mountain @-@ building named T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ ug@@ ol .
families are also involved in the sub@@ si@@ sten@@ ed economy ( cultivation of agricultural products such as cattle breeding be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetables .
it is difficult to get over the l@@ aps .
the district council provides free candles and bread to the villages .

&quot; despite her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not to leave before Ab@@ ov@@ as to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in waste @-@ Asia , &quot; &quot; tells them . &quot;
Gal@@ ina wants no financial support from her daughter and help her with her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly gro@@ ove are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a veget@@ able garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot;

&quot; while she tells her story , a younger neighb@@ our appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; calls T@@ ante Gal@@ ya her . &quot; &quot; they said , we could cultiv@@ ate zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; actually , it has more something to do with pill@@ age . &quot;
after the war there was little work and all lived as it was right .
&quot; I remember every day , like the city and the war once were . &quot;
as our talk to the end ten@@ ds the little boy is over to us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies from the window and another boy ch@@ ased him back .
&quot; he plays with the ball , which then down the hill . &quot;
a group children now pur@@ sues the ball .
&quot; while they run , some of them are looking down to the falling buildings . &quot;

in Mexico home &quot; Mama Africa &quot; migrants on their long journey

this article by Amy Br@@ acken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with friendly permission .
&quot; on the way of migrants , the Europe or Latin America cross , some places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
I visited one of these places in the Mexican City of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he is located on the border to Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
&quot; it is headed by a 59@@ th of leg@@ end , a small woman with a cor@@ al @-@ pink glasses , and gold @-@ coloured ear@@ rings in T@@ ed@@ dy@@ b@@ ären form . &quot;
it is called Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was raised in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and has grown up there . nevertheless , they know many among the name of Mama Africa . &quot;
&quot; this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a target for Af@@ ric@@ ans and Hai@@ ti@@ aner , who are on the journey . &quot;
the hotel has always no charm .
&quot; for around 2.50 dollars , the night sleep in simple rooms , with k@@ ev@@ ing walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the course there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a c@@ age .
there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and ha@@ iti@@ an migrants here .
&quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez , the people come in full mini@@ bus and the upper part of the coast they start to call : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
&quot; at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept out on cart@@ ons . &quot;

&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has recently arrived in a short time . &quot;
I asked him if mom Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a yog@@ hur@@ t@@ ee ) with Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .

&quot; yes , yes , &quot; answer with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it fits to her , since African women are very nice women . &quot;
lov@@ ingly .
it has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
&quot; Sebasti@@ ao trav@@ els with his sister , which hopes to Boston to find their husband and the three children there . &quot;
&quot; you have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Af@@ ric@@ ans who are on the way to the United States , normal to make a first stop in South America and then go to the north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard from other companion of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells you the Hai@@ ti@@ aner and the Af@@ ric@@ ans often travel together the route and that the Af@@ ric@@ ans already speak on W@@ hat@@ s@@ App from Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
how many of his companion has lived in Brazil before and lived as a builders of building the Olympic Games and the football world champion@@ ship .
&quot; he was weak@@ ened as the Brazi@@ lian economy , he began his journey into the United States . &quot;
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he s@@ ells SI@@ M Cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana Se@@ aling .
I ask him whether he will have contact with Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; Mama Africa is our Mother and we never let them go again , &quot; answer he smiling . &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells you their guests often send text messages , when they have gone to gr@@ ts or to report her about the course of their journey . &quot;
she declar@@ es that her Christian faith of the drive of her work is .
&quot; she does not know much about Africa , but their guests have brought their own chicken as in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known , but it is not the only radio hope for migrants that travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
at the other end of the city a cu@@ l de sac leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter was Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family migrants in their small house .
he is polic@@ eman and has noted that the Bus@@ car tickets are sold to numerous African migrants .
&quot; he began to help them to get a reasonable price , then he gave them his house for one dollar the night offered . &quot;
at the moment 25 people there mainly Hai@@ ti@@ aner .
&quot; some sleeping on blank@@ ets on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a kitchenette . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explained that he knows what the guests can go through .
&quot; I lived in the United States , he tells . &quot; I have experienced what they experience . &quot;
I have crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . this is the reason why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived for three years , he was transferred to a raid in his work place from the United States . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants that trav@@ elled through Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;
José Antonio Cord@@ ova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez tells me that he had fl@@ ed in Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to spend money without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for an accommodation and have an unknown , a all @-@ cat@@ walk , has its roof offered to him . &quot;
&quot; some months later , the family lives and she tries to decide where the next steps should go . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
in the hall@@ ways the trav@@ ellers are quiet their tel@@ eph@@ ones .
&quot; a mini@@ bus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that their house is full , but it is also no@@ stal@@ g@@ ically , because of which they have gone . &quot;
like a proud grand@@ mother ple@@ aded them in their album with numerous photos .
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair loss which have made an Kun@@ din , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old . &quot;
she laugh@@ s when she took me briefly .
&quot; Y@@ a se fu@@ eron , &quot; they are repeated every time . &quot;
China : X@@ in@@ ji@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a monitoring app on their phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter @-@ Us@@ ers and in the area of the area of the area
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ in@@ ji@@ ang , an ethnic minorities region in the West China , are forced to install a Spy@@ ware on their phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 , the mobile phone in Tian@@ shan District of the town Uru@@ m@@ qi is a cell al@@ erts in which they points the district government called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) . &quot;
the message is said that the app is to get access to terror@@ ist information .
&quot; however , kis@@ ses the authorities use the app for more than fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia were arrested 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women in the autonom@@ ous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture , because they had previously installed the app , messages with a private We@@ chat group . &quot;
&quot; in the communication of the police , the app will determine the sources and the distribut@@ or of terror@@ ists , together with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang@@ s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a shel@@ ter with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ ang@@ su Tele@@ com . &quot;
&quot; the main function is the block@@ ing porn@@ ographic websites , of online sc@@ am , tees and ph@@ ishing sites to make users there@@ on how much time they spend online , and to control your own home network . &quot;
this App with the filters for under@@ age should help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an App with these functions can of course be used in a variety of ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; &quot; remote &quot; &quot; state actors or even h@@ acker advertis@@ ed , the home network of a person to manip@@ ulate or ste@@ al it . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
&quot; while reports about digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China usually concentrate on the experience of users in larger cities across the east and south , the reality is very often frag@@ ile for those who live in remote , displac@@ ed ethnic minorities such as X@@ in@@ ji@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; in order to limit in@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in the conflict @-@ areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cement and monitoring measures as well as rout@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; this published on Twitter @-@ based media @-@ Out@@ let &quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( in the area , the area of the area ) , the zen@@ ed news presented in China , showed photos of a ch@@ eckpoint and police offic@@ ers to veri@@ fied whether they have been installed the monitoring app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian authorities make sure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang App .
a mobile notification required that the people install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are discovered in a ch@@ eckpoint of a device without these software , they could be imp@@ ris@@ oned up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a back@@ light for technological development .
&quot; they have been forced to use the people , devices that are intended for older people to use . &quot;
this is a form of cap@@ tivity by domestic technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( in the middle of the area of the same area ) and also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang @-@ Description from which the software is able to lift up the default challenge of a Windows operating system and thus access the hard disk drive on the computer .
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang will become computer and mobile phones in X@@ in@@ ji@@ ang for electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be minimi@@ ze a reaction to the instructions of the city &apos;s convention that minimi@@ ze the spread of illegal content .
&quot; all governmental , authorities and with the party establ@@ ish@@ ments , including universities and research institutions are oblig@@ ed to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security office when operating their computer and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a current report of Freedom House , an American human rights @-@ organization , also mentioned these new monitoring Methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ in@@ ji@@ ang , the authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Uru@@ m@@ qi received an regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneur@@ s , up to 1 August its &quot; personal ID Cards , phones , external hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory &quot; to the local police . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously any &quot; terror@@ ist videos &quot; to identify and destroy this promotion , however , the personality rights of Uru@@ m@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole range of other potential prizes , including those who refer to peaceful religious or political news . &quot;
Sleep or death ; part 1 : all cry to death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie Bar@@ kli@@ more ( CC BY 2.0 ) .
&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; Sleep or death , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane prev@@ ents his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world you look at and exp@@ ands that you are quite alone on a place where everything is important . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually dis@@ solved and revealed a truth , which is clearly recogni@@ z@@ able , both from inside and outside . &quot;
one that makes their names all honor .
one that has taken into a list of feelings and phr@@ ases that does not allow met@@ ap@@ point .
&quot; but when you look back the reality and you behind the scenes - beyond the actors , the beautiful scenes , and the performers - turn the characters in beings of meat and blood , and all cry to death . &quot;
&quot; all doubt solve themselves in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth are caught up on the axis of the he@@ aled that your parents and before them have built your grand@@ parents , stone by stone . &quot;
&quot; they have arrested me and my father thir@@ sty , but that I am not yet , so I mean &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the Chief of the Security service it form@@ ulated - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
he put his power over us under proof that even destroyed the simp@@ lest concepts that we knew .
five young people were ra@@ ined during a peaceful prot@@ est such as un@@ spoiled from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it trav@@ elled to make the city the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu &quot; Sh@@ ower . &quot;
&quot; all distric@@ ts , on my own not . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , reg@@ ret@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I put no high demands on a city that is up to the arter@@ ies with state security organisations and their comp@@ liments . &quot;
in the third night things had something so@@ othing after the power supply in the neighbourhood stopped .
I broke the silence by taking several times &quot; All@@ ahu &quot; from my home@@ dep@@ ach .
I heard my voice through the silence res@@ ist .
a few minutes later some of my friends were cour@@ age@@ ous enough to find together .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends decided to me ; we burned us to a pra@@ ised image that my expectations fully and completely fulfilled . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you become aware that you are free the spirit from the lamp , but it is not interested in the bar@@ rel . &quot;
&quot; I received a call of my father : &quot; &quot; makes you ready to meet with the military security building . &quot;
he placed on .
then I learned tort@@ ure : no matter how much honey you can low@@ ed - nothing can give you your voice before you have to give you all the way up to the office of the security of the body .
I came there .
&quot; the colon@@ el Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men , my father was already there as I now also . &quot;
&quot; the colon@@ el Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; &quot; let &apos;s listen to me , as you &apos;re sh@@ ake sh@@ able , or you are only bra@@ ve enough to cry , if we are not near . &quot;
his h@@ asser@@ ted eyes was set to me .
&quot; and you mour@@ n &apos;t really what to look into the eyes , and not on the ground ! &quot;
what I did did nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building . &quot;
&quot; maybe it was in my fool@@ is@@ hness , van@@ ity ; maybe in the revolution . &quot;
I was so sure when I answered : &quot; I did not think that you have already forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; and I think I have never heard this to look into the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the short@@ est conversation , that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I have no word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; put him in individual , and his Father are equal to it . &quot;
&quot; his father is the same with it . &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cur@@ sion is up to me now in the nose .
&quot; he was exposed to a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a se@@ el@@ ic tort@@ ure that I was exposed to monthly . &quot;
I passed the court .
in the first office I leave everything I leave with me .
&quot; afterwards , through the farm and into the second office , which leads through one gear to the individual cells . &quot;
I gave me all the details just before I take care of the room .
&quot; otherwise , otherwise they have shared a bigger cell . &quot;
&quot; I have to share with only one other prison@@ ers , and can immediately put me immediately , without what else to wait for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes , who felt like a whole life , the officials left the cell , and I access to a long @-@ proven communication method : with the f@@ ist against the wall . &quot;
&quot; I learned that my H@@ ellen@@ ic is a &quot; &quot; Er@@ sth@@ ä@@ ft@@ ling &quot; . &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he finally rep@@ lied to me .
&quot; apparently , in none of the surrounding cells have seen a respect@@ ful man middle age that looks similar to me and &quot; &quot; doctor &quot; . &quot; &quot;
in the perfect darkness can be seen in me no mark@@ ers face and doctors are not here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice like mine sounds ? &quot;
all the answers for its existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the great cells .
maybe he will immediately listen .
&quot; instruc@@ tor had in@@ sured me , they would release him if I stay . &quot;
li@@ ar .
&quot; I would like to have had a bird of bird , to distri@@ bute all these cro@@ ws that lab@@ elled in the morning in the garden of my head . &quot;
&quot; from the distance , I hear them still &quot; &quot; any@@ ahu &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be about 10 a.m. in the evening ; always around this time , the scri@@ be , every day . &quot;
the door opens up .
&quot; I was always convinced that black saw the color of the der@@ iv@@ atives , until I saw the yellow light that made us the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Don@@ ner &quot; , refer@@ ring to the 13th S@@ ure of the Koran ) . &quot;
they are here to listen to .
&quot; this was the secret to defend and prevent the state of security in front of us and to prevent the betra@@ y@@ al and terror@@ ists , they speak to us in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - thus they played their con@@ fes@@ sions and set the tight view@@ point of their world view . &quot;
here is not a house that is here is not a land ; it is a cur@@ se that they call co@@ existence to transform the cri@@ minals of their sound in a hero .
&quot; I super@@ vised the audi@@ t and tre@@ ats on Abu I@@ mad , a slim and du@@ ous man ; at least he comes so before . &quot;
&quot; he begins a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expres@@ sions , which is still young , you are still young , you can shut up as much more important with your life , when you follow these diary and demonstr@@ ates how soon to find an end soon . &quot;
I rep@@ lied not .
I do not understand it to answer .
I can really no longer say when ins@@ ults and blow@@ s have become a friendly conversation for me to an ordinary communication .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
&quot; any voice in me said that I had to become aware of it or evil in it , even though I had done nothing to make these pun@@ ishment . &quot;
an pen@@ alty in all its diversity .
his command is to rip to me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the lov@@ ingly &quot; con@@ fes@@ sion . &quot;
it begins with a plastic tube that is probably taken from the clo@@ ak@@ et .
your h@@ enk@@ er su@@ dden on your scre@@ ams .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure you with him and you can not with@@ hold your scri@@ be . &quot;
&quot; my scri@@ be was not yet enough , so that is why they are inter@@ change@@ able by a cable . &quot;
during my first capture I asked if the investig@@ ators had worked out earlier times as Mü@@ ll@@ ers or whether that belong@@ ed to normal working amenities .
&quot; they had four cables in each other , to present us the , from their point of view , great in@@ vention of a huge cabin . &quot;
&quot; within a single hour three of them , while I still had on the line . &quot;
&quot; I had lost every feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I listen@@ ed to cry . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ enk@@ er noted the cooling , and I did not found all the fall , which is why it worked as our neigh@@ bor to an electric@@ ally pun@@ ished stress . &quot;
&quot; flow through my whole body , enough to supply my whole neighborhood . &quot;
&quot; my half@@ heart@@ ed body , which lay stret@@ ched on the ground , was the perfect black@@ head . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness dis@@ appeared and pain was again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
it must have been so around midnight .
I decided to sleep again and let me say that was my only option .
&quot; some hours of g@@ ay , which came to me like minutes . &quot;
then the call to dawn .
the door opens up and the dawn meets the space &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , as@@ hi@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; I answered with the voice of an ex@@ haus@@ tive youth , &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father has to worry . &quot;
&quot; be silent and walk you , you will be moved . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always left me .
where do they lead me ? !
the j@@ ord@@ an Rap@@ by Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b respon@@ ded to the rights of L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + -@@ community , free expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigar@@ ette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was recorded by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sp@@ ends the bulk of his time inside , sometimes he s@@ dert on his screen , sometimes to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
&quot; but if one can leave , is a cigar@@ ette between his fing@@ ers or with nic@@ otine inhal@@ ed lips . &quot;
&quot; he lives in the chief proj@@ ec@@ tile of his family , which had been part of them since 1967 ; the year , in the Israel ended his cast of the West@@ bank , and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family looked to escape from her village in Palestine in which they had lived as fel@@ low@@ lands ( approximately : far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for more than six years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is a passionate activ@@ ist who is opposed to the conserv@@ ative majority and their alt@@ proven opinions regarding gender , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ music . &quot;
&quot; with his music , who often att@@ acking themselves with subjects such as Orient@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees . all these issues are not only interested in his home country Amm@@ an relev@@ ance , but also in cities that suff@@ ice by Dam@@ asc@@ us in Syria to San@@ aa . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees itself as a someone who is restricted in his mind , and he can feel according to his own statement with people who suffer from the dev@@ ast@@ ating consequences of foreign intervention in countries like Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not open it , he weigh@@ s a special incl@@ ination against the US American foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b consi@@ ders his art in his studio in Amm@@ an .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to do in war , anything to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian sp@@ ig@@ rant who has been born in Jordan , even if he was born in Jordan , and so far has never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think because of my own living conditions , says H@@ d@@ ai@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he added : &quot; I think so because I am a person , while in water deleted N@@ esc@@ af@@ é in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ ad@@ an ; in this time it is intended for Muslims from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the j@@ ord@@ an law also states that the public di@@ schar@@ ge of food during Ram@@ ad@@ an illegal .
obviously H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weak@@ ness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand has a cup of coffee on a s@@ eng@@ ing hot Jun@@ it@@ ag little with prot@@ est against Islam .
&quot; basically , the s@@ lau@@ g@@ ings are a warm coffee and the wa@@ ders of the K@@ ent @-@ cigar@@ ette in the nose , primarily of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes the Jordan , feels like a prison under the open sky , especially when you ra@@ ises a look into the neighbor@@ ing countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is simply avo@@ id@@ able to do basic things - as in the public during the Ram@@ ad@@ an Water - to land not in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Interior of Jordan , has said a performance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a , already for the second time . &quot;
&quot; a few parliament@@ arians who support the Islamic promoti@@ onal front - the j@@ ord@@ an branch of Muslims - arg@@ um@@ ented , that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual fron@@ tier of Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , the cultural and traditional standards of the country is contradic@@ tory and the main reason for the concert . &quot;
&quot; members of members and former Press room in the Islamic coalition DI@@ MA Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N , that the concert was &quot; &quot; straight &quot; &quot; because of the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot;
&quot; many claim also , the commitment of the band in matters like the Arabic spring , human rights and free expression in the Arab world is more dangerous activ@@ ism , which poses the old proven legi@@ timacy in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a the j@@ ord@@ an people as &quot; progressive supp@@ orter of human rights &quot; &quot; who continue to use for a intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement is probably not easy to sei@@ ze rh@@ etor@@ ic , but actually that reflected a clear @-@ cryst@@ all@@ ing reality in Jordan that occurs in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs work clearly . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b traditional generations , having his vision of the fate of Arab women wo@@ und@@ ed sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the sk@@ el@@ eton of a apparently lu@@ d@@ ressed woman , whose arms and legs are up to the cor@@ ners of the canvas . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who actually believe . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the number of &quot; hon@@ ors &quot; &quot; increased in Jordan - the in@@ official outside left . &quot;
Human Rights Watch reached its height . however , the number of hon@@ orary infrastructure achieved their cli@@ max ; however , even though the institutional infrastructure is missing in order to support the women , the victims were tried to support the victims of violence or domestic violence . &quot;
&quot; according to a law to desp@@ air fighting from the year 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of in@@ familiar violence , and for their release is often a lon@@ gl@@ anger bureaucr@@ atic effort as well as the guarantee on the part of the family , that the woman has nothing to happen . &quot;
H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs music enjoys great pop@@ ularity and is well known to reg@@ ret not to reg@@ ret those in his country long as tab@@ ular .
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b passed that his work is political , however , that he puts his music , which is full of exp@@ licit reference to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , not from politics . &quot;
&quot; come from the Nah@@ ost , man . &quot;
&quot; I was immersed in politics , &quot; says he . &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack .
&quot; in &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; and in &quot; &quot; gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; is the focus on poverty . &quot;
&quot; the list of songs , which are essentially political , can be further developed . &quot;
in March 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it too . &quot;
&quot; in further course of the song H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a sort of market , in which one can , in his words , &quot; which one wants , &quot; &quot; be faith or non @-@ believe , H@@ eter@@ o or hom@@ osexu@@ ality . &quot;
he noticed that hardly someone in Jordan is talking about the rights of co@@ ils and lesbi@@ ans and that comments on equality between L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + -@@ individuals were still c@@ ens@@ ored in 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b conducted an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an Online@@ program RO@@ Y@@ A to remember that his comments were out of the context , rot@@ ated and his opinion had been c@@ ens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube it was done without snor@@ k@@ elling , but it was only a modified version , &quot; says he . &quot;
today H@@ d@@ ai@@ b open to the arab@@ ic L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + -@@ community and represents the opinion that int@@ oler@@ ance against hom@@ osexu@@ als do not be Islam .
&quot; he mentioned Abu Nu@@ what , a po@@ et of the eighth century , which is still remember@@ ed thanks to its hom@@ erotic poetry in memory . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks yourself : if Abu Nu@@ what could work later on behalf of pot@@ assi@@ sts , in the eighth century could be open@@ ly writing about hom@@ osexu@@ ality , why can Jordan ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a or the fact that the concert was canc@@ elled . &quot;
&quot; in the H@@ ash@@ emite Kingdom , there is nothing new that the government attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are per@@ spiration . &quot;
&quot; recently , January 2017 , the j@@ ord@@ an@@ ic translation service took several former government officials and members of the teacher , with the reason , they would have cri@@ ed for comments in social media , with the deep in the land se@@ aled corruption . &quot;
&quot; given him , the concert H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs agree only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to work a structural uph@@ ill in the next generation of the Jordan . &quot;
&quot; for him there is progress a constant g@@ low and take . Jordan , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a has now become a performance in a row , but the way of progress - it looks for slow , bed@@ dings and inner@@ ful changes . it is certain that these changes from day to day in the heart of the j@@ ord@@ an society will take place . &quot;
&quot; finally H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , as millions of other Arabs , even from an Arab world without inter@@ ventions from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he dre@@ amed not only to bring his work to Bag@@ hd@@ ad , Jerusalem and Dam@@ asc@@ us , but also of them . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region with the help of music , art and literature of a real and fundamental openness . appro@@ aching - and not by bom@@ bs , stretching and arti@@ ficial art her@@ e@@ ated democr@@ acies . at least hop@@ ed it . &quot;
&quot; until it is far as far , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue and therefore also resistance . &quot;

&quot; rarely were outer appearance and body care so important as in this story , because they help to fo@@ ster the Peru@@ vian youth from the crime , and to promote a legi@@ timate work like the hair@@ dres@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; el Call@@ ao , Per@@ us more important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high cri@@ minal rate , where road energy and illegal drugs are all daily . &quot;
&quot; one in April 2017 , survey showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel secure . &quot;
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for a@@ esthetic services for men .
&quot; the trend , the appearance and thus also the sophisticated hair@@ styles of famous sports such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has always led to the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sing that can make this elabor@@ ate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the un@@ prec@@ ed@@ ented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the outer limits of fantas@@ y and creativity , even has an annual event inspired the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sing &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , who has been taking place since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there , experts come to meet each other in order to show who from them can see the ec@@ cent@@ ric l@@ ooks , as you can see in the following video ( further videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook @-@ Profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions like the August@@ o Sal@@ azar B@@ ond@@ y , which is found in El Call@@ ao , find here an opportunity to convince young people to get their weapons against hair@@ dres@@ sing tools , and instead of bad advice on a training in the hair@@ dres@@ sing art that allows them to find work . &quot;
motiv@@ ates from this activity and the opportunities we have seen do@@ z@@ ens of juven@@ il@@ es that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school offered in front of March beginning with special training workshops and reported some of their suc@@ cesses :
&quot; in 1995 we were the only group school in the municipality and the district , which we are very proud of love for the children we have built this educational community . &quot;
Colombia : Lov@@ ing an Gu@@ er@@ illa

&quot; the following article is the modified version of the lecture &quot; &quot; lovemaking &quot; &quot; which has published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot;
the contribution will be published here in a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only Lov@@ e@@ fe to people who we know ?
&quot; is it not yet much more important , people who feel mis@@ er@@ able to escape aff@@ ection ? &quot;
&quot; exactly this question went to the two young Colom@@ bian ac@@ tivi@@ sts Leonardo P@@ á@@ r@@ rag@@ a by the Stiftung Bog@@ ot@@ Art and C@@ risti@@ an Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation ( Letters to recon@@ ciliation ) , the young people to write down , Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ak@@ fought letters . &quot;
&quot; only in front of short , her land was acting of an historical event , and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had a peace agreement with the Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ary of F@@ ARC ( german : revolutionary armed forces store ) , which forms the batt@@ les of the lon@@ gest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
international was the under@@ signed of the peace contract as so significant that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize .
but in front of the Colum@@ bi@@ an@@ ans there is still a long way until you can speak about a real recon@@ ciliation and peace .
&quot; gu@@ err@@ illa d@@ amp@@ er , who were exposed to many years in illegal bearings , and around the clock , and around the watch their weapons have to be integrated into life as civili@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; in turn , the Colom@@ bian society in turn , who used to live in constant fear and in some cases deep har@@ ass towards Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ak@@ cent , it has to support them in their ranks and support them in the construction of a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and C@@ risti@@ an were convinced that young colum@@ bi@@ ans would like to close together and would help with the process of integration process .
and this is exactly what they did : until now they have written thousands of young people today - love ships at former Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ umination to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign are 69@@ 00 letters - one for each former Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ umination which should be personally handed over .
the Valentine &apos;s day as an inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the letters to recon@@ ciliation was born on the world summit of Peace Prize , who took place in February 2017 in Bog@@ ot@@ á . there had Leonardo and C@@ risti@@ an the opportunity to speak short with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ arth@@ i , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize . &quot;
&quot; this explained that we love the people that we love , at the Valent@@ inst@@ ag thousands of lovemaking , but those not forget that they need a lot of necessary . &quot;
&quot; he plane , he told he continued to share his love with people who needed more pressing the pressing . &quot;
&quot; this is how the plan , letters full of hope and support for former fight@@ ers of the F@@ ARC , who now find their place in society and to create a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is willing to make the dis@@ course of a war history to a common history of peace , &quot; say it . &quot;
so far as part of the campaign were collected more than 2000 letters .
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á . &quot;
&apos;@@ I have never thought that someone would be for@@ given ?
the first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN @-@ camp in the Cal@@ don@@ o region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca .
&quot; a group of 40 students at the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Stiftung Bog@@ ot@@ Art s@@ ests in the camp to provide the letters personally . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC stood on how they had done earlier to accept the commands of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they received no prec@@ ep@@ ts , but letters full of dist@@ ressing of people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible , how many different feelings can walk in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies in between , &quot; &quot; told the politicians &quot; &quot; Manuela J@@ im@@ é@@ ne@@ z Av@@ ila later . &quot;
Sandra Par@@ ra , a collabor@@ ator of the govern@@ or of the province Valle del Cau@@ ca . this unforgettable experience so : &quot;
&quot; after we passed the letters , brought me a former fight@@ ers by the camp of the Gu@@ er@@ illa fight@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; &quot; ( a kind of hut , where the gu@@ err@@ illa war@@ k live ) I saw an Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ umination which has written something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go , because next to it on the bed lay a M@@ GL Gran@@ at@@ cher , a fatal weapon in the thorn @-@ sheep . &quot;
&quot; I still spoke him and said , &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what do they just like ? &quot; he answered , &quot; I answered a letter that someone wrote . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ e@@ ful letter .
&quot; never in my life someone has written something so nice , therefore I answered him . then I suddenly hit me the t@@ ears about the che@@ eks . &quot;
I emb@@ oss@@ ed him completely and put me next to the pom@@ eg@@ ar .
&quot; maybe he was the war sorry , it was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fight@@ ers , and wanted to help him to write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he never expected anything else from life than war . &quot; &quot; I had never thought to preserve him and his six brothers in front of the fam@@ ine . &quot; &quot; I have never thought that someone would be awarded me for my mistakes . &quot;
&quot; but now I know that there is outside a society , which is waiting for us with open arms . &quot;
&quot; until now I learned only , how I have to handle weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
the kick @-@ off came students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC to a discussion break together .
the students were all up and has already been war and the F@@ ARC already worked in the dark .
&quot; therefore , the leader of the F@@ ARC contributed the history of the organization , its ide@@ als and gave insight into their views over the peace process : &quot; many years we have experienced the social inj@@ ustice from the state to the whole of the state of the state , we can contribute to a political party , we can help to make society in this country . &quot;
&quot; for a goal of this size , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
&quot; these people have heard who have never found hearing , and to ack@@ n@@ owledge that people who have often seen as mon@@ sters and even h@@ ate people who have been avo@@ ided by their living conditions and their environment , was very pain@@ ful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality , in which the country lives , does me hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; but it comfort@@ ed me that all men - even those who have killed and so much damage caused to give us something and a smile and a hug . &quot;
many former fight@@ ers have respon@@ ded to the letters .
&quot; Gu@@ stav@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the comm@@ ander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Arch@@ bishop of the city of Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot;
the Colum@@ bi@@ an@@ ern was pus@@ hed that after the dis@@ armed peace would be glori@@ fied .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as it is ine@@ quality , hunger and a lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to gather to the weapons , and for their rights are justified ( ... ) . &quot;
we are putting from F@@ ARC now on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we call all the def@@ ender of peace in - regardless of what breed , religion or ide@@ ology it rises above all those who dream of a land in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word to make our contribution and bring victim , as we know from own experience that nothing is simple . one among us who defend life as the basis of existence , many difficulties will be imp@@ ris@@ oned . &quot;
on our way there will be many obstacles but together we will overcome them .

&quot; hom@@ os@@ exual and que@@ er people who live in the Cau@@ cas@@ ian region , are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and comp@@ ression . &quot;
&quot; with hor@@ ror , ac@@ tivi@@ sts have experienced the reporting of the last few months over the persecution of pregnant women in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; but the threat , which depends on like a D@@ amo@@ kl@@ es@@ cri@@ tically over the bust@@ ling L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q community , is not only created overnight . &quot;
OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a tran@@ ss@@ exual female from Gro@@ sn@@ y who told some of their experiences with us and talked with us what is happening in the Republic .
&quot; the L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conqu@@ ered several months ago the international headlines , after reports were published , tort@@ ure and k@@ illing que@@ er men in the Republic of them@@ atic . &quot;
&quot; the first report was published by the Journ@@ alist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gas@@ eta ; she cast a light on the methods of non @-@ government authorities , the condem@@ ned que@@ er men imp@@ r@@ ints and put them in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; they brought a mon@@ ster to the world , &quot;
&quot; Sabrina , a trans@@ former , was born in Gro@@ sn@@ y and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; even since her child@@ hood she felt , she was in reality a woman . &quot;
&quot; when they grow , you became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for them , which is why they moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had experienced by the sex , the hunt was opened to Sabrina . &quot;
&quot; from fear to her life , they went out to the USA . &quot;
Sabrina : I was active as volunte@@ er hel@@ pers for human rights .
one day was told me that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a acqu@@ aint@@ ance from Dag@@ est@@ an , a Trans@@ woman who put into difficulties . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , made someone who thought of whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it all over the internet , with my telephone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his ch@@ op@@ ian friends , with the following message : &quot; then there is no men to eliminate these shame ? &quot;
then the photos of my documents made by completely W@@ hat@@ s@@ App the round .
on 10 October 2015 I was att@@ acked .
&quot; when I just returned , a couple of shopping m@@ ask from the back@@ seat of my car I heard a male vote : &quot; here is a gift for you from your unc@@ le . &quot;
&quot; when I turned me , I feel something in my body , but I did nothing . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on Ch@@ echn@@ ics : &quot; how long do you want to honour the family , you are Sch@@ and@@ fl@@ eck ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I know only that there was a young man , not 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost the consciousness and wa@@ ited last end in the hospital .
apparently some women got everything and started to write .
the man was fl@@ ed .
the women had a ambul@@ ance .
&quot; in the hospital I learned that I had two keywords in my right cat@@ tery . &quot;
OC Media : in what practices were you placed in the men or women ?
&quot; Sabrina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name dr@@ one ; but the doctor stood , and lay down to the women . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I am very grateful . &quot;
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his brush , I got to do with the fear ; it was a Muslim , a kiss name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him that he was respect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
last February I got thre@@ ats .
&quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , stran@@ gers , some completely unknown . &quot;
this was the beginning of a night@@ ly .
my family was attended by neighb@@ ours and some distant relatives .
to send me to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that everything was a lie .
&quot; they created ab@@ sur@@ de demands : some said to me , I have to prove it by the streets without through the roads ; others wanted to be changed at the official TV in Gro@@ sn@@ y , and say that I had not changed my sex that everything was only worse , and Photoshop . &quot;
I have Bas@@ ket size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this print ?
Sabrina : it is still hard for them .
some older men spoke one to my mother on the road .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; You have brought a mon@@ ster to the world that not only your family , but the whole of the Republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot sti@@ r you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother was too much and she laid out a stri@@ ck around the neck .
fortunately the neighb@@ ours came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to a flat and a few hours later the window stood a car with a penet@@ rated window plates and a valley @-@ plate with a 95 dr@@ on .
&quot; after it happened for the third time it was clear to me that there was something la@@ zy . &quot;
my human rights @-@ friends have been veri@@ fied the gro@@ mm@@ ern@@ ment - it turned out that I have been pursu@@ ed .
OC Media : how are you flown ?
Sabrina : with the help of ac@@ tivi@@ sts .
&quot; I want to give their name their name , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with her aid I left the land , but then passive somewhat im@@ balance . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SI@@ M card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
&quot; I bought it , without me to register , without reve@@ aling , without everything . &quot;
I broke my old SI@@ M card and cast them into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and check@@ ered to the hotel .
the number was registered on a for@@ eig@@ ner .
I put the SI@@ M card into my mobile phone .
&quot; in the moment when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t believe about , you war@@ ns in security , just because you have left the land ? &quot;
our people know already in which hotel you see . you even know your room@@ number .
only to prove it : it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine ? !
that was in fact my room@@ number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however we do not talk about intercourse but this is a tabby topic .
&quot; some traditionally k@@ au@@ kas@@ y elements , I still have in me . &quot;
so much I also wish to overcome this se@@ el@@ ic bar@@ rier I cannot overcome .
&quot; I say that , as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them . &quot;
&quot; when we ch@@ att@@ ing with camera , I actually give me effort as the person looks out of her past - thus to my male form . &quot;
but this is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends who have stayed for themselves ?
Sabrina : I fil@@ ed last week a report in Washington .
for the needed I need current information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; I spoke to someone who have entered into ar@@ gun , half of the months in Ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; he told that during the Ram@@ ad@@ an , no human being arrested and tort@@ ured , but also that all the end of the Ram@@ ad@@ an could hardly wait and he concluded a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will focus now on family and relatives .
&quot; with that my me , they probably invite the relatives , they are concerned about the problem with the person concerned person and in the end , an proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; is experienced by blood satisfaction . &quot;
OC Media : are now still flo@@ od@@ ed in these sec@@ rec@@ y products ?
&quot; Sabrina : a familiar with me says , there were not very many . &quot;
&quot; if , above all those who have no rich relatives or were dro@@ pped by their relatives were to place K@@ err@@ rows Court . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they will be arrested there , so that they can present them later as terror@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; say , you should be alter@@ ed her body on TV and say they would have att@@ acked some village or a military support point . &quot;
understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not easy to dis@@ appeared , but targeted to radical . &quot;
OC Media : is now only a mut@@ ation or do you have a source for this information ?
Sabrina : I just have someone who was imp@@ ris@@ oned in ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have gone again in this prison after her be@@ ard had grown .
there has since been nothing new of them .
they simply have taken .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even better than these people were arrested . &quot;
&quot; but until now they were not presented as ban@@ di@@ ts , there were still no reports . we promise that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why else would you have not allowed these people to shave ?
&quot; know whether these pers@@ ecu@@ tions and de@@ duc@@ tions of people who were of a so called &quot; &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , already in the past ? &quot;
Sabrina : I have contributed my hair always long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think before 2003 I was already known in Gro@@ sn@@ y when I lived there - and I never had problems .
in the Ernst !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the sh@@ aria , I never had problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , at that time it was much saf@@ er than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia was originally designed to lead us to the &quot; &quot; civili@@ z@@ ations &quot; , &quot; but has finally rej@@ ected us into the St@@ one@@ age . &quot;
OC Media : how is that possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sabrina : my eyebrows were cooked , I had colored eyelashes , tru@@ g Ro@@ und@@ je@@ ans and short Tops . &quot;
the safety of the Sch@@ aria has never curved me only a hair .
&quot; before the Russian theatre in Gro@@ sn@@ y there was a place where every night , especially at week@@ ends , a whole group of people met like me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several ben@@ ches were standing , and all the city knew , she knew why men , young people , there met . &quot;
we were never ris@@ oned .
in the ch@@ op@@ ian language there is a re@@ treat : K@@ hard@@ a ma K@@ hard@@ a . that is : &quot; Sp@@ otte don &apos;t say about the un@@ happiness of another . &quot;
one says it often to children when talking about cranes .
&quot; OC Media : so they just have their eyes closed before you because they believed , you are sick ? &quot;
Sabrina : yes .
they have never ris@@ oned off , never dre@@ amed and never be@@ aten . &quot;
OC Media : how long was this mercy seat ?
Sabrina : so long until K@@ err@@ row entered the plan .
&quot; as he was appointed Minister of Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to speak on TV on mor@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; he did not talk about us , but also about the behaviour of women . &quot;
nevertheless - you could feel how to change people in the city .
&quot; who previously worked , and succe@@ eded , consider you at once with Arg@@ om@@ n . &quot;
in the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel how the situation in the Republic have been constantly lost . &quot;
OC Media : what activity do you go to ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the US are not much .
apart from that I am still active as a activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim men .
I communic@@ ates with them as a kind of psycholog@@ ist .
&quot; we organ@@ ise Te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , co@@ ats , I leave them to hospital and hel@@ pers them to get food@@ stuff . &quot;
I do not miss any p@@ enny for it .
I discovered these people even when I go re@@ fuge .
I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you carry a touch ?
Sabrina : this is al@@ mond .
&quot; so , nature , which does not have nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ es , who want to make you with foam in front of the mouth , that there are no co@@ ils with them . &quot;
&quot; the Dag@@ est@@ ans have which , the cab@@ ard@@ ine have , which Russi@@ ans have also which ; on the entire planet there are - but not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it is to me un@@ pleasant , Soviet . &quot;
I meet here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practic@@ ing Muslims who go into the mosque and during the Ram@@ ad@@ an fa@@ sten - live with men .
&quot; know many thinking in transi@@ ent identity to men who love men , and they believe that you will be his family to make more intimate experiences . but this is a chest . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different types of sens@@ ation , to be accurate , different li@@ festy@@ les . &quot;
for me it is the most important to feel myself in my own skin and not ash@@ amed me for my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
&quot; sorry , that I will be so personally , but my last intimate relationship now is already longer than a year . &quot;
and I am not at all sorry that - I know that I am now myself .
local groups war@@ n before an increase in masturbation within the imp@@ over@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iran@@ ian Ah@@ wa@@ z region is suffering from a very un@@ usually high employment rate and mut@@ ation rate within the local Arab population .
since the last few months there is a strong increase in self @-@ mor@@ des .
the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .

&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August , the dou@@ bt@@ ful situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is marked by poverty and unemployment . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Th@@ aw@@ ra in the South of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran@@ ians .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he fo@@ aming for his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the in@@ ability to come up for his family , as Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; one on YouTube shared video held the moments when he had charged himself , fest . &quot;
&quot; some people made it quickly , the fl@@ ames back to clear , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ han@@ i Hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; local sources , the bur@@ ns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more . &quot;
he died a short time later .
&quot; it was not the only su@@ icide , which has happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and ac@@ tivi@@ sts from place war@@ ns that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights paid that this month some other - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - heard . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : there were all family fathers , who felt due to the persecution on the part of the Iran@@ ian government , hel@@ pl@@ ess and rest@@ able to take their families to nour@@ ish and safe work . &quot;
&quot; Arabic Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , in which a large part of Iran live in the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community , was sh@@ aken by a pro@@ found economic crisis that makes the native Arab population is hard to ride their way . &quot;
&quot; in front of a century the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a pre@@ domin@@ antly autonom@@ ous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi mon@@ archy the power took over and 1925 great efforts to finish the ethnic autonom@@ y throughout Iran . &quot;
in the Ah@@ mad region there are some of the largest in Iran in the coming oil and gas fields , as well as some of the en@@ rich and most valuable commercial areas for the Iran@@ ian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite this valuable resources , the regional economy continues to grow slow and the local population gets only little from this wealth . &quot;

the Iran@@ ian regime den@@ ied the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ Arab@@ ian system@@ atically in local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry . &quot;
&quot; the government also has a variety of insulation ; the waters of the Arab areas in the Persian area , where the provinces Is@@ fa@@ han , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m . &quot;

&quot; Do@@ hi@@ mi said that especially the unemployment has become recently worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of in Ah@@ wa@@ z new an@@ coming ethnic performers and a anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the process process : &quot;
&quot; as function@@ alities and institutions prefer not to set Arabic work@@ force , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i will have moved the access to work possibilities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aimed to destroy the spirit national resistance of young Arabs , and force them to force their lives outside their home to Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;

why I do not identify myself with femin@@ ism but with the inter@@ section not

the following article is an over@@ worked version of the opinion that was published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the website A@@ fro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments under the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women - particularly white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with m@@ ust . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even place well refined scientific and social arguments against me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally should all femin@@ ist * inside .
&quot; for example , that women nowadays are still less money in spite of the same formation as men . &quot;
that women still under strict observation when it comes to what they may do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epid@@ emic .
&quot; or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women sooner or later in various areas of living on a smooth blank@@ et , and that discrimination is still going through the many different countries and bel@@ iefs . &quot;
all of this is aware and known .
I am convinced and I am very double and thre@@ e@@ fold .
I am a black lady .
&quot; yet , if I have to speak on skin colour , on black transi@@ ent women , on black transi@@ ent women , on black women in the L@@ GB@@ TI@@ Q con@@ gregation , or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I have chosen , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , there were many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ section femin@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; but they all agree that women - all women - come together in order to raise &quot; their voices , and &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord &apos; to be able to achieve the equality ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they do not want to talk about it that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence is an institutional form of rac@@ ist motiv@@ ated violence , which we are exposed black women in two ways . &quot;
&quot; or in addition , black women and women of other eth@@ nia and origin are less deser@@ ve less than white men and women . &quot;
that black girls and girls with a mig@@ rational background of school are referred to as white girl because of obvious integration problems .
&quot; or that women are exposed in black spher@@ es and women with mig@@ rational background to a higher risk , domestic violence and violence in the partnership , as white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want all the women , all men and all men have any skin paint the same rights ; on the other hand , I can consider myself to be a black woman in whose center the white woman is to consider themselves , inj@@ us@@ tices in their thinking that focuses on the sex as well as on the skin color of a person . &quot;
&quot; I am exhau@@ sted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ istic approach , who has always rej@@ ected me and in@@ numer@@ able other black women and repe@@ at@@ edly rej@@ ected . &quot;
&quot; So@@ jour@@ ner be@@ de@@ ed 18@@ 51 in her speech : &quot; &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and I wei@@ g@@ hed me to justi@@ fy an ide@@ ology in which the black woman is an un@@ inhabited and mar@@ gin@@ alized being . &quot;
I wei@@ gh me to connect me group@@ ings that ab@@ sorb from cultural ex@@ propri@@ ation of our seats and customs to advance their eg@@ oc@@ ent@@ ric program .
&quot; I will no longer try to allow white women to raise the importance of the inter@@ section of skin color and gender , because some of them continue to destroy the importance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement tot@@ alt@@ ed , no matter how many black women will try to instruc@@ t them for a better . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ section of femin@@ ism was founded to give women different approaches to a home and to reduce the white femin@@ ism , is still the word &quot; Femin@@ ism &quot; in his name . &quot;
&quot; I draw it to join me full and completely from femin@@ ism , which was initi@@ ated for my dark skin and my status as a woman rather than woman in a white @-@ femin@@ ist paradi@@ gm that is so stu@@ b@@ born that inter@@ section@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; now it is more important than ever before , that we define black women in our own ideas and give us to the spher@@ es that are created by us for us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Af@@ ric@@ ana bl@@ anism : rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing ourselves ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can create our own way in which they can make ourselves completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , mental , physical and even the spiritual elements can be taught . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ section femin@@ ists immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion , after they read these lines , please inform you about the hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected . &quot;
&quot; in a bl@@ ur@@ istic environment I can up@@ lift black women and women of other cultures , because in this paradi@@ gm I have existed . &quot;
I will be recognized because of my dark skin and due to my existence as a part of this paradi@@ gm .
&quot; I , a black woman , can blow@@ n in an environment where my life has neither passed , nor ignor@@ ed . &quot;

the following article is the short@@ ened and processed version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article is part of the series # Por@@ Ser@@ j@@ er ( # so@@ lich@@ ein@@ e@@ frau@@ bin ) that reported on the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to protect the affected people .
&quot; Ad@@ a B@@ á@@ ez said to Ad@@ a B@@ á@@ ez , that they had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her Ex@@ ist who had become viol@@ ent against viol@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; since the end of their relationship was some time passed and the police said , their statement would not be put to the sh@@ epher@@ ds , but more could not do . &quot;
&quot; as another woman of Bal@@ bu@@ ena because of abuse , also the active @-@ saving display of Ad@@ a B@@ á@@ ez nothing . &quot;
a few days later the second woman moved her ad back .
break the vi@@ ci@@ ous circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women at all time , they receive no support from the part of the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women also depend on the men that they have been mis@@ used . this explains why only 20 % of all women who ad@@ mit , victims of violence , at all in the cri@@ minal en@@ forcement authorities . &quot;
&quot; 1 Schl@@ saw and Statisti@@ ken@@ 2 In@@ visible Mis@@ cell@@ ular and a legal system , that is nothing subj@@ ug@@ t@@ 3 Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , lack of implementation and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to determine how many women really mist@@ aken , My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , Research for Gen@@ der@@ ask at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aci@@ ón y E@@ studios , a social scientific research device in Paraguay . &quot; there are various information and reports that are not even appro@@ aching the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
but the figures available are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 the district of law gover@@ ning 9@@ 600 ads due to domestic violence . at 70 % of it we went about violence against women .
86 % of the ads at the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads due to domestic violence during peace . even here 86 % of the ads of women .
&quot; in the ads 40 % of women , that they were physi@@ cally har@@ ass@@ ed , 55 % of women spoke of psych@@ ological missions . &quot;
these statistics are however not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay .
&quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ an Women , Ana Bai@@ ardi are actually visible only a few of these pun@@ ishment in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; on every woman who rei@@ m@@ bur@@ sed in Paraguay because of psych@@ ological mission@@ ary display , 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; on any woman , who rei@@ m@@ bur@@ sed because of bodi@@ ly abuse display , come two women who do not do this , &quot; explained at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; as Frauen@@ icide in Paraguay is not an own crime , may not be appropri@@ ately documented how many women should be ass@@ orted each year from their current or former partners . &quot;
only until August 2016 journalists were at least 12 cases of women &apos;s ord in the country .
co @-@ ordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were mur@@ dered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates put in Paraguay every ten days a woman due to violence through men .

invisible missions and a legal system that has nothing to be under@@ taking
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z the firm friend of Carlos vera became , he insi@@ sted that they called on behalf of all their former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning she did not want , but then still to . this should it be forever . &quot;
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos combined . but two years they went to mental violence against women - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most frequently recogni@@ z@@ able :
I have never thought that I would like to be victims of abuse .
&quot; when I have read earlier this , I thought that the only women often happens to sub@@ mis@@ sive because they dec@@ eive themselves from viol@@ ent men . &quot;
I was convinced that I would never happen .
Mari@@ ana pol@@ ed social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera .
&quot; without names to name , she wrote contributions on Facebook where she described their ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship and told how he was isolated . &quot;
&quot; many people respon@@ ded to their contributions , including Carlos yourself . he asked rh@@ etor@@ ic , whether he ever asked the hand against them and rej@@ ected , that his behaviour has also been a form of abuse . &quot;
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why they had fallen for so long from Carlos and left him earlier .
&quot; it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least have some compassion on it . &quot;
Victoria San@@ tos that is not derived from Paraguay , almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner they have been mist@@ aken . &quot;
&quot; Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te cre@@ o ( &quot; &quot; I think &quot; ) that consists of women all in any way victim of abuse . &quot;
&quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , each other and to support each other . &quot;
you do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vic@@ tori@@ an &apos;s case everything started with psych@@ ic mis@@ ery .
&quot; their we@@ alth@@ y partner , it finally made it to convince you that she was worth@@ less . &quot;
then he began to beat them .
Vic@@ tori@@ an ads in the authorities remained without a result and also by their relatives , she received no support . &quot;
she led a trial against its former partners who developed into a und@@ eni@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and their home country in which it was mainly for money , power and the influence of their former partner . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , lack of implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not being applied . &quot;
the display of abuse is a path full of resist@@ ors and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos .
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ aur@@ i , a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay , sees great problems with the application of the laws in the country . &quot;
on 10 August 2016 in the par@@ agu@@ an Parliament was discussed in the par@@ agu@@ an Parliament which was known under the has@@ ht@@ ag # Por@@ El@@ las ( # Für@@ th ) .
&quot; this has@@ ht@@ ag and the movement # Ni@@ U@@ na@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ e@@ One ) is part of a campaign on Twitter , which is supported by Am@@ nest@@ y International . &quot;
the original design of the law sees itself to explain Fem@@ en@@ d to become a unique pun@@ ishment to explain and harder to pun@@ ish as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; so the bill introduced in some points to gain the vote for the law , the fear@@ ed that the way for the de@@ cri@@ min@@ alization of abor@@ tions will be b@@ anned in Paraguay and pun@@ ished with up to five years of cust@@ ody . &quot;
&quot; the original bill had provided , most of the ( bureaucr@@ atic and economic ) proce@@ eds , who have to wear the victims of violence pres@@ ently , if they just want to ref@@ und and maintain a safe accommodation to the state . &quot;
Ech@@ aur@@ i ar@@ gues that the law does not be effective if the bill is not sufficient for sufficient financial resources for it :
in Paraguay is considered to be a part of inter@@ personal relationships .
&quot; here , a circum@@ stance should take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something norm@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; those who are wel@@ ded in the given of these facts , thus contribut@@ ing to me and contributes to that the per@@ petrators of pen@@ gu@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have to ref@@ und so long ad , until abuse is no longer considered normal . &quot;
&quot; on 10 November 2016 the law in the par@@ agu@@ an Senate , previously mentioned parts of the law have been modified . however , among other things have been alter@@ ed a passage that under@@ cri@@ ed the partners in cases of domestic violence for recon@@ ciliation . &quot;
the opinions of changes will go apart .
the section regarding recon@@ ciliation was seen as an opportunity for ag@@ g@@ ress@@ or to address the victim again .
&quot; but the string of the words &quot; gender , &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; of parts of the law is considered a great return . &quot;
this article is the short@@ ened and processed version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article is part of the series # Por@@ Ser@@ j@@ er ( # so@@ lich@@ ein@@ e@@ frau@@ bin ) that reported on the violence against women in Paraguay .

independent media in Oman a year after ban a newspaper continue to attack attacks
&quot; this website has been block@@ ed due to a resolution of the information minist@@ ries &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the forbidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than one year ago , the om@@ an@@ ic authorities have joined the independent Arab@@ ian paper Az@@ am@@ n due to their reporting on corruption in the Sult@@ an . &quot;
&quot; You@@ sef Al @-@ ha@@ j , one of the speakers of the newspaper , continues to be in prison , where he took away a one @-@ year @-@ old sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other re@@ agents of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and placed before judgment , but later came back . &quot;
&quot; Oman is governed since 1970 from Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us ib@@ n S@@ aid , who came to power after his father , S@@ aid ib@@ n T@@ aim@@ ur , was set off by a state @-@ rich . &quot;

&quot; the rule of Sult@@ an is characterized by the per@@ sever@@ ing efforts of security vulner@@ able , in particular of domestic violence , including freedom of freedom , dis@@ clos@@ ets and human rights , independent journalists , blog@@ gers and other ac@@ tivi@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; the authorities rest@@ rict peaceful and legi@@ timate activities in the field of human rights system@@ atically , and ac@@ tivi@@ sts , because their views on public matters of the country as well as corruption in public authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the Zeitung Az@@ am@@ n , its closure , and the attachment of three of their red@@ ness in the last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper in which since its foundation was reported on corruption in Oman ( an absolute mon@@ archy ) until they were forbidden by the authorities in August 2016 .

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a member of the transaction committee , the ISS charged before the Special department and taken upon his arrival by the security forces . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 the ISS participated as the Deputy @-@ in @-@ chief , You@@ sef Al @-@ ha@@ j , who had respon@@ ded to Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is &apos;s establishment as editor @-@ in @-@ chief . &quot;
&quot; the paper was closed on inde@@ fin@@ itely , after the information minister had given the directive that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper on any way , including online , starting from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 the first trial was held in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ amari , Al @-@ ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i . &quot;
the court condem@@ ned the three journalists to imp@@ ris@@ on@@ ment and also serve the final closing of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ amari and Al @-@ ha@@ j were both condem@@ ned among other things because of dist@@ urb@@ ance of the public order , &quot; abuse of the internet &quot; and &quot; subj@@ ug@@ ation of the pres@@ tige of the state &quot; . &quot; &quot;
al @-@ ha@@ j also was inv@@ ented in violation of an Public@@ ation and the prevention of guil@@ ty .
al @-@ Ma@@ amari and Al @-@ ha@@ j were sent@@ enced to three @-@ year imp@@ fen and bankn@@ otes at the amount of 3000 om@@ an@@ ic Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sent@@ enced to a year in prison and a bankn@@ ote in the amount of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after making use of any information about the dis@@ semination of material that could be a threat to the public order .
for Al @-@ Abr@@ i a deposit was set in the amount of 5000 om@@ an@@ ic Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) and it was released on 22 August 2016 prior to the judgment .
the professional dish said Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 free , condem@@ ned Al @-@ ha@@ j however became one year and Al @-@ Ma@@ amari to six months of prison . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ amari was founded on 10 April 2017 after the beginning of his six prison sentence in Mas@@ esto . al @-@ ha@@ j is still in prison , where he took his one @-@ year @-@ old sentence . &quot;
the professional dish also raised the decision of the information minist@@ erial to conclude the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the Court , Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper looks after att@@ acked by the om@@ an government . &quot;
on 8 January the Information Minister was sent to a statement with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Information Minister has been in personally another statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and whereby the minister adopted a further time against the decision of a professional report , published the publication of the newspaper . &quot;
the permanent closing of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where in Oman in recent times the press freedom was viol@@ ated .
&quot; for further in@@ jur@@ ies , such as the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to put their operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the permanent closing of Az@@ am@@ n and the ar@@ rest of the journalists Al @-@ ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ an@@ ic authorities are still not ready to prepare the extensive violation of freedom of the press . &quot;
&quot; the Golf @-@ Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ an authorities to : &quot;
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ ha@@ j promp@@ tly and un@@ condition@@ ally charged ;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ concep@@ tions
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ ite War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , figure takes place with his consent . &quot;
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or even as it is not mentioned . this is an increasing area which determin@@ es one of the urg@@ ent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons : for a lack of medical research there are two reasons : for a lack of global healthcare being many medicines and vac@@ cines that cover the special medical needs on the African continent .
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and mal@@ aria have widespread impact as elsewhere , and lack of investment for exploring these diseases by the ph@@ arm@@ af@@ ir@@ men are a big problem . &quot;
&quot; second@@ ly , research , which is carried out by African scientists from African scientists in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be con@@ stitut@@ ed for economic growth of the continent . &quot;
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ ite War@@ rier is Director of the headquarters in the centre for expl@@ oration of inf@@ ectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in the 1990@@ s at Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epid@@ emic first gra@@ ving impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Sam@@ bia for a study in the United States , first at Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indiana . &quot;
&quot; post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he joined even on HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ ic health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of media through this research . &quot;
( Disclaimer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research theme ?
Ran@@ j@@ ite War@@ rier R@@ W : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . here I support the sam@@ ic national program for anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral therapy ( ART ) with labels .
&quot; furthermore , I have just ads a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ ogens . &quot;
G@@ v : what do you think are the important current issues in your country and in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
R@@ W : there is no basic research . we only implement solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this must change , otherwise we will always be reci@@ pi@@ ent , instead of your makers . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that we get , are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
G@@ v : where does the financing and support ?
is it enough ?
how simple or difficult it is to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
R@@ W : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are well supported .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , as financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
G@@ v : what is the researcher @-@ infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research that you do not have had before ?
&quot; R@@ W : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards in developed countries . it cost a lot of money , continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
lab material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
G@@ v : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; R@@ W : there are interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods in schools should be taught to improve the situation .
&quot; G@@ v : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on , and how can we support development ? &quot;
R@@ W : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there are demand for special scientific education , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; Economics , Computer Sciences , Big Data , study of Space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ agi@@ ous diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit very much . &quot;
G@@ v : can you describe the pro@@ s and cons of life as scientists in Africa from Western countries respon@@ ding to your experience ?
&quot; R@@ W : often , it is the limited speed of things to do , and the serious access to scientific expertise that pose here challenges . &quot;
&quot; the system that magazines have only accessible to payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; ) , also limited the amount of versati@@ l@@ ity information and the speed of research . &quot;
&quot; from the USA to India : like &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ Sa@@ at@@ gut@@ producers , the global food production changes
&quot; this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
Frank Mort@@ on breed for the 1980@@ s in the USA salad .
&quot; his company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ ge@@ ous , the first plant that has been cultiv@@ ated by NASA @-@ A@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in the space . &quot;
&quot; almost 20 years long , Mort@@ on work was done only by its own influences , and the question how many Sal@@ at@@ rop@@ s can get bound@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 2000@@ s he noticed that more and more sal@@ ads were pat@@ ented , and that he could not be used for breeding . &quot;
&quot; the patents applied not only for single varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a specific rot@@ ary or green ch@@ att@@ ed leaves . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , more such patents have been registered on more and more plants like grain or cart@@ ography . due to this trends provide plant safety , environmental protection and expert security for the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia old tradition , Mort@@ on still let@@ tu@@ ce , he needs for however longer , since his work is getting more and more likely to be wast@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; it is , when I lie in a river a b@@ oul@@ der , in order to lie down . &quot;
&quot; so we have to do this now , but it is a fr@@ action with the breeding tradition , &quot; says . &quot; I gu@@ ess that these patents go to Sal@@ ads . &quot;
&quot; and when they stand in court , no one can breed a new sal@@ ads , because all features are already pat@@ ented . it makes it as good as possible and tries to breed those features that he wants . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and stri@@ ves to use no material that is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
he is also connected to a movement which is getting bigger in the U.S. and all over the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; open source &quot; -@@ breeding ) .
ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the International Motor station ISS at red Rö@@ mer@@ s@@ ous in the &quot; green@@ house &quot; of the station was b@@ red and e@@ aten . there will be tested whether plants have been cultiv@@ ated in the space .
featured
it is no co@@ incidence that this name sounds rather as sounds as if the movement of the IT @-@ area comes from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; -@@ Sa@@ at@@ gut ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software .
&quot; it was called to life in order to ensure that some plants are protected and -@@ gens are not protected as intellectual property , and so that for plant bre@@ eders are permanently used . &quot;
&quot; as part of the initiative , in short O@@ ssi , US bre@@ eder can commit themselves to us that others can also be free of charge of them . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds . &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; bre@@ eder only allow others to breed the seed , it &apos;s not to cross their own varieties , and it is not immediately b@@ anned - two aspects that are b@@ anned by many plant pat@@ ented respectively . &quot;
do@@ z@@ ens bre@@ eders and seeds have already joined the initiative since its start in 2014 .
glo@@ omy out@@ look
&quot; for the em@@ eri@@ fied Professor of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madi@@ son and O@@ ssi @-@ committee member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control over the seed , and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important for nutrition security as well as environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; seeds , he plays a role in larger compositions such as biodi@@ versity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to use the latter not or only little by using seeds with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg st@@ resses that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement is not busy with gent@@ ri@@ ical alter@@ ed plants .
&quot; all kinds of plants could be pat@@ ented if vegetables , Kor@@ n , gent@@ ry has been alter@@ ed or not , from organic far@@ ming , who &apos;s most recent examples from Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Mon@@ san@@ to and Bayer in the global agricultural industry , it should also know that the way for example , such as this vegetables is b@@ red , is threatened . &quot;
nutri@@ tional sover@@ eign@@ ty without seed @-@ sover@@ eign@@ ty is not possible .
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative committed to them , others their seeds are still free to provide , so that you are going to pat@@ ented with seeds , seeds , and plant re@@ formation . &quot;

&quot; O@@ ssi @-@ Supp@@ er ar@@ gu@@ ed that the future of food supplies is at risk , since the available satisfaction is due to the ever pay@@ able intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always restricted . &quot;
&quot; Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of the O@@ ssi , has engaged in their doctor@@ al vari@@ ation with gen@@ etic vari@@ ation in carr@@ ots and their availability . it found out that about one third of all cart@@ oons are protected as intellectual property , making it available for plant bre@@ eders either not or only ag@@ gra@@ v@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; for other plants there are such estimates not yet , but experts like Lu@@ by conf@@ used that mass@@ aging plants as wheat are pat@@ ented in even bigger style as salad or carr@@ ots . &quot;
a question of visibility
&quot; plants will be so b@@ red that they have targeted characteristics - from such , through which their taste or color increases up to such , because of which they stand in certain environments and thre@@ ats like p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
opponents of patents on plant properties refer to that the available plant material for bre@@ eder by more and more patents accep@@ ting . gen@@ etic diversity is currently the necessary conditions due to climate change much worse predic@@ table .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail address Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ Spre@@ ed Car@@ ly S@@ ca@@ du@@ to , that gen@@ etic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four geography and cooperation with institutions such as the Federal Ministry of the United States . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not have to dis@@ agree that intellectual property rights other bre@@ eders since &quot; patents and protection of plant vari@@ et@@ able innovations fo@@ ster . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow , as soon as the patent is ex@@ pi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions help others to get to the same result with another method .
&quot; such an protection , thus innovations not , but encour@@ ages to be made available by public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
&quot; Mort@@ on sees the different : 20 years to wait until a patent turned , with certainly no innovations . &quot;
&quot; and if you are so long waiting to wait for plants that have adapted to plants that have been adapted to the changed environment , one would have lost the fight . &quot;
&quot; but the main location for Mort@@ on is that gen@@ etic resources have always been a general public and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ et@@ ory incen@@ tives are not attractive . &quot;
we want to make farmers their work easier .
&quot; this is what is driving us , and it will not be impossible , if we cannot use the best and latest gen@@ etic resources . &quot;
&quot; altogether , Mort@@ on went to pat@@ cher to pat@@ cher : &quot; we create the characteristics not really themselves . &quot;
&quot; the plants form they themselves and as bre@@ eders , we finally have no idea how the plants do that . &quot;
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US @-@ State Oregon and O@@ ssi @-@ committee member , there is another important aspect of the plant breeding : &quot; who is a sort of breed , bre@@ eders also its own values in them . &quot;
&quot; who believes in industrial agriculture with large cour@@ ty@@ ards and mon@@ oc@@ ultur@@ es , which are needed for the cultivation of her@@ bic@@ ide , the bre@@ eders in its varieties of this concept of agriculture . &quot;
&quot; my concept is accurate , &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that are on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents have to survive , even without patents to survive - either re@@ ject it or keep it for too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant bre@@ eders Frank Mort@@ on is looking for in his kenn@@ el sal@@ ads .
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
&quot; Mort@@ on is also the view that bre@@ eders would like to produce the prevention of plant Pat@@ ents innovative , &quot; &quot; it looks like being with my efforts , new to produce , stronger than companies who re@@ inde@@ er . &quot;
&quot; I need to be able to sell new material for my catalogue , as I know that my competit@@ or will be selling my varieties in a few years ago , &quot; &quot; says he . &quot; with a patent a 20 years ago is being protected from competition , which one makes it my opinion quite simple . &quot; &quot; worldwide reson@@ ance &quot;
&quot; while the US seem to be a leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , but the concept is spreading rapidly across the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the centre for sustainable agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) which describes itself as professional organization in the field of resources , an &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed re@@ productive cities works together with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties which meet certain requirements . &quot;
&quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; open Source &quot; seed , and to sell her own . &quot;
&quot; the German organization Agre@@ co@@ l works on an &quot; open @-@ source &quot; license , which ultimately has an formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ssi @-@ obligation for bre@@ eders in the European Union . &quot;
( regulations for breeding are different from land to country and the O@@ ssi @-@ obligation cannot be taken to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the ex@@ ek@@ u@@ tive of the European Union , the European Commission , explains that conventional plants should not be pat@@ ented and thus talks about the current practice of the European Pat@@ ent@@ am@@ ts , patents on conventional plants . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation however is not a law ; now it is to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent to these new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization of Hi@@ v@@ os hosted an conference on &quot; open source &quot; in Ethiopia and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organisations and representatives from East Africa to learn something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend for the sponsor@@ ing of seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ Sa@@ at@@ ben@@ systeme says that the organization is currently an worldwide alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ Sa@@ at@@ ben@@ chmark systems , for the plan@@ ing next year of the official start . &quot;
&quot; a mer@@ ger from environmental protection and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit organization US@@ C Canada and the Action group to E@@ rosion , Technology and Concentration ) has compiled a database to Sa@@ at@@ good and biodi@@ versity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed @-@ map . &quot;
&quot; in September the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - a composite from aid organizations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report that farmers have to contribute to seeds , it can lead and improve the seed policy to ensure that a stable supply of food can be assured . &quot;
&quot; in the report the importance of a diverse , local supply with seeds st@@ ressed - a connection , from the Lu@@ by of O@@ ssi hop@@ ed to see him soon more people . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has to be respected , where and how something is cultiv@@ ated , and seed systems have barely played a role , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we are trying to cl@@ asp the people that is even more behind their foods . &quot;

Human rights organisations and blog are the latest goals of the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
still un@@ lock the Egyptian authorities contents on the internet .
this time the website of a human rights @-@ organization and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ sts .
&quot; on the weekend at the 05 @-@ August , the Egyptian government officials find the website of the Arabic network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which reports human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world . &quot;
&quot; August released the network of an opinion on Facebook , in which it cri@@ tic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step , and promised to continue work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Arabic network for Human Rights Information , bt@@ - despite this attack and the Constitution by the authorities concerned , to cover the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , even if it has never been so important to overcome this aims , so it has never been so important to overcome this aims , so it has never been so important to overcome this aims , so it has never been so important to overcome our goal . we h@@ itting up our task to meet . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I considered the first zen@@ zed website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities block@@ ed more than two months of 21 websites , such as the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ speaking issue of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and that from Qatar stam@@ men@@ de Network of Al Jaz@@ e@@ era because of all@@ eged support for terrorism . &quot;

beside AN@@ HR@@ I also there is no access to the blog of Columbus and human rights des@@ h@@ ers Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada no access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of Colum@@ ns and articles that he does not write on other websites and media for in Egypt .
&quot; now the blog was to move to the cement @-@ appar@@ atus of the Egyptian government , even the aim of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blog@@ ger , the supplier at which also is located in Zi@@ adas blog . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journ@@ alist , spent nearly 500 days in cap@@ tivity , having been arrested in December 2013 by Egyptian security forces , while he took over the Stud@@ enten@@ prot@@ ests and a video who took the police bodi@@ ly violence against two students . &quot;
his articles are turning mainly to politics and human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Go@@ ada spoke to the block@@ ing through the government and refl@@ ected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; however , that blogs to lock is very old , however , has priority on the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the block of blogs possibly not significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It is succe@@ eded to give me the feeling of an expression ; an ar@@ rest , a sed murder , pre@@ di@@ schar@@ ge in national security Council , the block@@ ing blogs as well as any other website , for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proven that I do not have anything else . in other words , my words have influence , if only on a small audience . &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I used to go to the post of articles in order to walk the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship . &quot;
&quot; however , after they have block@@ ed him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the bra@@ ve go the way up to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 . August 133 websites . this provided technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provider ( IS@@ P ) , including Orange , V@@ od@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at . &quot;
&quot; AF@@ TE is also documented the block@@ ing of vend@@ ors , through the conversion of dor@@ etz@@ en@@ sur and private sur@@ fen , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( VP@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
&quot; on Monday , 12 June we noticed how the block@@ ing of websites , the VP@@ N@@ s began . &quot;
&quot; such practice indicates the intention of the government to block content and to filter , to the Egyptian user may have access to the Egyptian user . &quot;
&quot; the situation in addition , the situation will be lost in addition to the c@@ ens@@ ors , which the Egyptian population does not have the legal situation , helping them make trial against these actions . &quot;
&quot; now , the question is : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and whom will it be the next attack ? &quot;
is Rio de Jan@@ eiro in war ?
the inhabitants are disp@@ ute .

&quot; day for day report newspapers in Brazil with glo@@ omy headlines from Rio de Jan@@ eiro , the second largest city in the country and home from numerous post@@ cards . &quot;
some of these headlines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old in school shot , &quot; &quot; E@@ eden second day will mur@@ dered a police force in Rio de Jan@@ eiro , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Marine and air@@ w@@ af@@ ee to Rio . &quot;
&quot; right in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the non@@ violence occurred in Rio the highest level for 10 years . &quot;
&quot; the Brazi@@ lian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called the United Nations on , one . &quot;
reports like these are all@@ eged and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; for the detailed reporting of violence in Rio famous newspaper &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; on 16 August the edi@@ torial &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; in which they announced , a new section called &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city will now be published there .
the moti@@ ves for their decision explained the newspaper as follows :
&quot; extra will continue to report about crimes , which happens in every major city on the world such as Mor@@ d , Rau@@ b , sexu@@ al@@ verb@@ ally , etc . all , which is published by civili@@ zed standard in the heading &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
&quot; this is the only alternative , so that we did not close our eyes to cru@@ elty instead of cru@@ elty instead . &quot;
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video that was divided on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , that this decision is not a reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure . &quot;
extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war breaking in a country that does not realize war at all .
&quot; in the same video , a journ@@ alist of the newspaper , that it is based on the Institute of Intern@@ al Security in Rio de Jan@@ eiro 843 areas that are controlled by cri@@ minal organisations . &quot;
in the Editorial the newspaper writes on :
&quot; let &apos;s consci@@ ously aware that a consci@@ enti@@ ty , if it is di@@ stor@@ tion , even if it can be used , cru@@ ise the police , which is only sho@@ ots and then asks questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the struggle against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civi@@ lian population , but the economic power of the Maf@@ ia and its partners . &quot;
does the name &quot; War &quot; more than they are supported ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Brasil arg@@ um@@ ed the journ@@ alist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , against the violence as &quot; war &quot; . &quot; this is their opinion a justi@@ fication of the failed security policy through the media and could it be sc@@ rubb@@ ing , responsible for the police to account . &quot;
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and worse planning - as an extra treatment in Rio itself has shown - in combination with in@@ sufficient investments in personnel , Education and a historical and self @-@ pleas@@ ing neg@@ lect of public service . &quot;
the memory : the State of Rio de Jan@@ eiro is bigger than just its capital .

Rio de Jan@@ eiro as &quot; the most viol@@ ent place in Brazil is wrong : &quot; 22 of 30 viol@@ ent cities in Brazil lie according to statistics of 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the latest data available .
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Jan@@ eiro .

&quot; extra belongs to the company Glo@@ bo , the largest media company South America , which emphas@@ ized as Cec@@ í@@ lia , since years the security policy of the state . &quot;
&quot; among these vulner@@ ability measures also included the founding of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the federal state Rio in 2003 in the police unit , whose aim is to conqu@@ ering a massive pol@@ ishing and a unit permanently there to stationary . &quot;
&quot; initially , this led to a reduction of viol@@ ent deaths . for a couple of years , the U@@ PP is actually being protected following several reports on Sch@@ ik@@ anen and repres@@ sions against poor communities who should actually protect the neu@@ ter police unit . &quot;
on his Facebook page the journ@@ alist Jo@@ ão Paulo Charle@@ aux out of one of his article from the year 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not comply with the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio seen as war as war as well as serious consequences for people . &quot;
&quot; because this calls for the state on the means of means and paths that is typical for a war . this is the intru@@ sion into the territory of a &quot; &quot; enemy &quot; &quot; where a civil war is an un@@ sharp point in the countryside and the object for &quot; &quot; colle@@ ague &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ir@@ r@@ inted balls . &quot; &quot; &quot;

at one night in the autumn of 1994 the conquest @-@ Af@@ gh@@ ans began by the Tali@@ ban .
two years ago there was a terrible civil war between the various bra@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n group@@ ings which had conqu@@ ered the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan became a land of ter@@ ror and desp@@ air .
&quot; right at that time A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province G@@ haz@@ ni in Central America for the last time with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother was not so said , so she knew that she would not see her son very long - maybe even more . &quot;
in the dawn should be the boy .
his unc@@ le would pick him up and bring him to the to@@ em@@ body .

&quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of Haz@@ ara domin@@ ates the party of Hez@@ ilo @-@ e @-@ W@@ ah@@ dat had just been mur@@ dered by the Tali@@ ban , and many Haz@@ ara had suddenly prev@@ ented . &quot;
the Tali@@ ara known for their h@@ ass on the Haz@@ ara @-@ known Tali@@ ban were always closer .
many Haz@@ ar@@ se left the land towards Pakistan or Iran .
some days after his flight took A@@ yo@@ af in Pakistan .
he worked for a couple of years in a co@@ ar@@ rest . the work was difficult and made him sick .
&quot; then he took the what was left of his low re@@ ward , and went in Iran . once again , he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and worst s@@ acks with mort@@ ar , who were heavy as he himself in order to make his lifestyle . &quot;
&quot; at that time , life was af@@ gh@@ an refugees in Iran marked by mis@@ ery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; remember@@ ed A@@ shar@@ k in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( af@@ gh@@ an refugees ) lived in a empty building on the building site , on which we also worked . &quot;
&quot; there was no services there and no heating . we susp@@ ected n@@ ylon in front of the open windows , so that we do not refres@@ hed at night . &quot;
after four years A@@ shar@@ af left his life without Pap@@ ers in Iran behind and made himself ready for the trip to Europe .
during the dangerous cru@@ ise on the sea suffered from ship@@ wre@@ ck and stran@@ ded on a small inhabited Greek island .
&quot; after the Greek authorities had rej@@ ected his ast@@ ral yield , A@@ shar@@ k 2002 came to Italy . &quot;
&quot; some time was A@@ shar@@ k ob@@ hom@@ eless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church , which twice the day food on helpful . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy due to relatively high residents quot@@ a is a sort of second chance for rej@@ ected as@@ yl@@ um seek@@ ers . it is true , but also that the conditions that have as@@ yl@@ um seek@@ ers in the country , cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
&quot; the Civil Liber@@ ties Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; suff@@ ers under a general lack of transparency . &quot;
the vast majority of as@@ yl@@ um seek@@ ers is hous@@ ed in the more than 3000 &quot; special recording centers . &quot; this is Impro@@ vised institutions in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian law as@@ yl@@ um seek@@ ers can only be shared an application center , if it has officially placed an application to A@@ sy@@ l - which can still be drawn into the registration of as@@ yl@@ um . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for an accommodation , either on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the road . &quot;
so it is also A@@ shar@@ k .
&quot; however , his we@@ di@@ ble hab@@ itats was half shar@@ eholder , soon to free out of these conditions . &quot;
&quot; after spending several years had done various works in the construction , put A@@ shar@@ k its entire savings in the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice . &quot;
&quot; this went so well , that he opened after a while still a second hostel and a speed . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ atis success story is now subject to the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Veneti@@ an luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director A@@ min Wa@@ hi@@ di .

the conditions for entrepreneur@@ s in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to the official estimates there are approximately 20,000 Af@@ gh@@ ans in Italy . &quot;
for many of them the country is a transi@@ ent solution on the way to other European countries .
&quot; in recent years a few of Af@@ gh@@ ans @-@ owned company , including cut@@ ters , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Af@@ gh@@ ans restaurants have even succe@@ eded in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of his restaurant Ori@@ ent Experience , where the wa@@ iter and the kitchen was mostly made from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant tells us by the various Af@@ gh@@ an , Ira@@ qi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their trip to Italy . &quot;
the Af@@ gh@@ an entre@@ pren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ aland@@ ari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a s@@ ushi Restaurant in Rome are also Af@@ gh@@ ans .
&quot; A@@ yo@@ s goals tend to be far beyond the Italian cuisine and retail out@@ lets and aim to leave back to the country , which he had to leave as teen@@ ager than teen@@ agers . &quot;
&quot; where a risk is , are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ yo@@ af with a smile . &quot; I would like to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I never forget my land and I cannot live happy when I know that my people are suffering .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country especially for women .
they represent half of the society and have to get the same options like all others . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ k for@@ ged plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where the people can learn packaging and preser@@ v@@ ative techniques . &quot; &quot; so they can sell their harvest time on the market and improve their financial situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the development of successful entrepreneur@@ s was a journey through un@@ certainty and dou@@ bts , but at the end are stability and prosperity . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ k has made this trip itself . now he also wants to help other Af@@ gh@@ ans on this path .

&quot; the Egyptian Parliament checks a bill , which demonstr@@ ates that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration in a government authority . &quot;
&quot; users would have to be able to use the social networks within six months , within six months after their successful legis@@ lative acts on the website of the authority with their full name as well as their for@@ warding . &quot;
&quot; if he failed to failed to this step , could be condem@@ ned up to six months of sentence or the end of the pen@@ dul@@ ation of a pen@@ alties . &quot;
