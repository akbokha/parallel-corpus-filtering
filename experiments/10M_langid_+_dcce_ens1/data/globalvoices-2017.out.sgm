<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extremely big.</seg>
<seg id="4">"as many of my generation I grew up with American films, have been agreed to American music, American authors have read and operated his sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had a great profound effect on me that I was mainly because of a American film journalist."</seg>
<seg id="6">"when 14 years old I saw the great Denzel Washington, like he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican cover, a fearless reporter, who covered with the help of Julia Roberts as a Jura coed of a oil-magnitude with judges that had its interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free to Method Man," I was, as if that the absolute truth is, Vergiss everything else, that is what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year, which I lived in Arizona, had my admiration for the US only."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said:" "America is the only country where I have ever lived, whose variety is so welcoming, that you are always the way you are, and it is easy to find acceptance within a community of simultaneous people."</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very angry love about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he goes with his commitment.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never hold of his mind behind the mountain as you say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks, like a former colleague, and explained in publicly his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afroamerians and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people have responded to his statements and tuned for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million voices, which he won during the republican pre-elections, was the highest number that was issued by the party nominate candidate."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans who support this biggrotto, I asked myself?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not get Trump and his voters not with people in harmony that I had to know during my time in Phoenix.</seg>

<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors whose favorite advice has helped me a lot with my career."</seg>

<seg id="29">"while Trump its way to nominee Republican presidential dates, it offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">Yet it turned out to be that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans, mostly grain, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of its contempt against non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the examination of the idea that people have agreed to Trump, because they either agreed to his racism and fanaticism or because they were ready to overlook these things almost the heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Maybe it is unfair the Trump-voters to be described as racy.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the human beings, said one of my friends, is exactly what has led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficially and respectful and indicates a disability to understand those who act in a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not considered.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, of which most white are, for Trump tuned because they want to win control over a country that she has disappointed?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might want to say that they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can barely forget the words of David Remnick that looks the cruel decision to raise a man who looks different with contempt on those who look different."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" "whitelash" "(An....: as much as" "disagreement of the pastures against all other ethnia;" "words from white in reference to the whites and Whiplash, what is the great Van Jones nowhere, has just the killed what America has made so great."</seg>

<seg id="98">"this article, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, published a magazine that targeted by international, practical solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-release happens during an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa was then known that this ship had already run in liftan waters illegal fishing, before moving the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">The Eastern African countries were raised over demarcation and little geneives to welcome a bill of criminal offences of this kind in its chicory.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilised themselves rapidly against the ship. they denied him to hurry one of their ports and prolonged him to tell him a fishing."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister is surrounded by countries that you simply denied everything, Benedict Kiilu, a quietly employee of the Kenyan fishermen. it is part of a team that discovered the ship and persecuted."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was then displaced from the waters of the region: it was not succeeded to catch there fish."</seg>
<seg id="105">"finally, there was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia due to pillage the fishermen of the country."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, the criminal practices passed through and resources was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop Illegal Fishing Association (Illegale fishing)."</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are among Somalia and Madagascar the six countries that had distributed the prime minister out of their waters at the time.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "with this we have eight countries that are equal and working together. you exchange information and stand out each other when it comes to illegal fishing," says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts project. this project offers FISH-i technical support. "</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is impregated by definition: what is caught it is hidden because it is extremely difficult to lace it is extremely difficult because of it is the illegal fishing of the overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">"through the intentional disregard of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems can have a delikious balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing were once performed by bureaucratic dums, with the information between individual countries, so the actions occur in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"there, the individual countries can interact with each other than lists existing licenses, news on generating activities or details that have noticed or experienced during a longitude."</seg>
<seg id="113">"Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive, when they move on the open sea, using satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows to mark the authorities, ships to mark those in the botanic areas. even such a divide drive travels - about such that indicate that a ship invites you to go on other ships on other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"basically such investigations can show such investigations whether the participating ships have a fishing license, where they were on the road and may also be whether they have a penalty."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are against illegal fishing, can not be denied on the basis of such ships in their ports. and that they may not sell their charge of punishment, and that they may even be forced to be part of punishment, as in the case of prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it is about considerable financial losses for the owners, meaning that illegal fishing is not worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"and that is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, leitender Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a Beratercompany that focuses on the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already mentioned platform was created to win estimated 20 million USD to retired sales, which will lose eight members of the network HISH-i every year because of illegal fishermen, which in eastern African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">"East-Africa has one of the productive tuna fishing, even for the region of commercial fisheries from around the world. among these also those illegal fishermen."</seg>
<seg id="122">"their practices include actions like the sailing under the wrong flag, fake licensing, specification of fantasies, the fish-protected species and fishing in nature reserve."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they make use the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non-quito organised control system", "says Long." "formerly a ship was illegal and a country could then say 'You can't run my port."</seg>
<seg id="124">"yet another country could say 'Komm to me'." "and just this legale dfled try to finish FISH-i now."</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its founding FISH-i was involved in more than 30 examinations for over 30 studies.</seg>
<seg id="127">"it has criminal networks exposed, the fake licenses distributed in Tanzania. it discovered ships that have several fraudulent identities and found it fleeting ships and found."</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its collaboration with Interpol, international authority to fight crimes, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "some of our investigations lead us pretty far into the networks of organised crime", "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system to help the FISH-i to be condemned ships precise.</seg>

<seg id="132">"Fish-i's satellite system that will always be further developed, also helps them to watch the illegal ships that would like to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and position, "" says Duncan Copeland, Chefanalyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NRO, who also deals with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support. "</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships turn off for example its automatic identification systems from which they can no longer be carried out from satellite.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland helps to build a system which connects different information levels. it should help FISH-i to find criminal ships with bigger precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">One model-program</seg>
<seg id="137">Yet FISH-i's team African nations did actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing industry?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believe that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened together with Google and the marine organization of Oceana, the platform Global Fishing Watch opened: a platform, the satellite transmission offers and by means of the position of each individual adjustable ship worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "meet with the neighbors to get a better image of who what is doing - that makes it simply mind," "says he." "here is a chance for countries to negotiate themselves and their resources to the examination."</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this at global level." "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project to run, where a global system allows the persecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities are not only criminals.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships used to reckon earlier without licence and barely changed with consequences they know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participated in FISH-i countries now have a 33% increase in fisheries chipset, since there are more licenses for more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia helped, Greko 1 raised, the inspectors found there on board towing networks, whose application is prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries please note these achievements." "the effect is so strong that us now also have other countries," "says Kiilu." "we are going to disappear several hundred million dollars by illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015 six countries were joined together, to the so called West Africa Task Force. also they fight against illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model such as FISH-i." "With Safety is the goal, even more such initiatives and structures also arise in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's youngest member states to report his first big triumph: in October there was Greko 1, a ship which was on the road under the wrong flag. and not only the ship was on the road and were used in towing networks, which is now forbidden."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also still used in botany waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the Taking of measure rules against Greko 1 set the a strong sign that they pronounced against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time evidence that such a special, collaborative approach to protect the oceans actually works. Emma Bryce is freelance journalist and lives in London. there she writes the topic environment, technology and nutrition."</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide circulation of translators are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"to cover, one requires two important skills: passive language skills to understand the output text and active language skills to transfer him into the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter does not require the active domination of the goal - something that is in the event of the event. generally, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the output language - Mother's language."</seg>
<seg id="379">So a French womb should translate for example from English to French - not from French.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr-User Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies employ a lot of staff with English as a mother tongue, the translations into English. this may result in lacking understanding of the supervise, cost, or the relatively small number of English speakers who have to learn."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies who have no foreign employees, however, the Japanese staff will have completed and then the Japanese staff, whose English is made as the best of the translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr-User Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Automated translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the worrinted and enigmatic propositions which arise by automated translations, that this technique cannot replace any human translators. this applies to some languages very special."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English phrases in Japan, including the enigmatic printing prints, often used T-shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood."</seg>

<seg id="388">"translation error may be acceptable or acceptable or at least harmless. but of large companies or from the government that have the means to guarantee higher standards, we can expect more careful translations."</seg>

<seg id="544">"in early March 2017, the advances for the northeastern Japhoku Shimpo, the advances made in recent six years to rebuild the lives of those of the" triple-catastrophe "of March 2011. a huge earthquake, a tsunami and an Atom-accident in Fukushima had triggered the catastrophe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which lies in the prefecture of Miyagi, the prefecture of Miyagi had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami."</seg>
<seg id="546">"hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighborhoods of Fukushima and Iwate were forced, because the tsunami had all the coastal cities go away from the map."</seg>
<seg id="547">"in addition, the prefecture of Fukushima lived a atomic accident, even alone, we had to leave their homes less than 160 000 inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows from local point of view which progress has been achieved in order to rebuild the lives of the local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authorities as well as survey results of those affected by itself.</seg>
<seg id="550">Housing in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that until December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses (including strokes, saigai kouei juutaku) were finished in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate."</seg>
<seg id="552">"the biggest success among the three prefectures could be accompanied by Miyagi, here 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were finished."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has made 75 percent of such homes, including Fukushima with 70 percent."</seg>
<seg id="554">"well, you still have six years after the catastrophe, evacuated from Behrfsadation (including strokes, kasetsu juutaku) in final replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="555">"after the triple-catastrophe, almost 80 000 people were forced to live in Behrally."</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016 still 36 000 people lived from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such homes."</seg>
<seg id="557">"nearly 40 per cent of the year 2011 evacuated from Fukushima still live in emergency, including Miyagi, which was more successful than 75 percent of the evacuated leading to the disaster in Behrfsadmittent, were introduced in final homes."</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the number is found here at 34 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefters</seg>
<seg id="560">"as the Kahoku Shimpo Zeitung has been able to detect 1074 of 1100 schools, which were affected by the unhappiness, to open its doors up to December 2016, which makes almost 98 percent of schools of the three prefters."</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later that industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">"while almost 100 percent of fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi again are again in operation, have resumed at Fukushima only 30 percent of fisheries ports."</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the atomic accident occurred in the three prefectures Agrarland large-scale in collaboration.</seg>
<seg id="564">"Miyagi could reproduce 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 per cent of the Ackerlanes in Iwate and less than 50 per cent destroyed Ackerland in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of nuclear disruptions, because only 690 acres of 5 400 hectares destroyed Ackerlandes of Fukushima, lie in the" nuclear plague zone. "</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three prefectures, tourism has repeatedly recover, but also there remains Fukushima far too beaten."</seg>
<seg id="567">"the tourist destinations in Miyagi and Iwate are back to 90 percent on the same level, as before the unhappiness. Fukushima can be found here only 75 percent."</seg>
<seg id="568">"however, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since disaster nearly half of the coast-inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their habitats."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"in order to determine a total picture, the paper introduced numerous surveys among the native population and among the evacuated by. she asked them about the state of the re-rising and also as their sensations has changed towards the tsunami risk."</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article explains the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo led a survey by to bring more about the Tsunami consciousness under the native population in experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">"the survey brought that 83.1 percent of the domestic inhabitants, measures taken to be taken to be prepared for future earthquake and tsunamis."</seg>
<seg id="574">"however, 55.9 percent of respondents can still be done enough in terms of disasters prevention."</seg>
<seg id="575">How it stands for those who had to be evacuated from prefecture Fukushima evacuated</seg>
<seg id="576">"in its edition of the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper began their attention to the situation of evacuated from Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima had to experience not only the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami no, the prefecture of Fukushima was also witness of the worst, catastrophic, atomic incident, the Japan ever had to experience."</seg>
<seg id="578">"from 160 000 Evacuated from Fukushima, almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"at the beginning of 2016 there were slightly more than 23 000 people, returned to Fukushima, in permanent replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="580">After the state of 2017 still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">"most of the evacuated areas are most of the evacuated, older than 50 years old. they have to compete in real perceptions because efforts made for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima with massive building projects. this is what the efforts made for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima with massive building projects. this is what the efforts for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima will have to compete in Tokyo."</seg>

<seg id="753">"therefore, the Mexican news portal Animal PolÃ­tico is called the digital project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco "(German:" with drug trading live ") and told the stories of people who were in the fight between the Prosecution and cartels."</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project so:</seg>

<seg id="774">We don't just have to show the faces of those who face the fear. we must show the international community the conflicts, the fragility and citizenship. "</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>

<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">"sometimes I feel the feeling, as if I am the one who was charged or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body."</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent at this time or consider it as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it is not normal that my 10-year old cousin thinks that he is Narco (german: drug dealers) if he is great. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the" heroism "of the offenders when they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me this is, as if they teeth those who have lost someone and those who have fear that also happens so something."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories to mere numbers are being given in statistics.</seg>
<seg id="788">The inaction of men is unbelievable for me when the death of six people and the torture of 43 students are justified in a neighboring place that they were abandoned.</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to talk about that they are spared by such tragedies if they are not touching and silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City has written the contribution" "Four months Erpresses in Hauptstadtbirths: like a family with Dromen presidency".

<seg id="799">The journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the article "The forgotten children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: one of violence marked.</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions on how: who takes care of the child of a missing woman and a man that was murdered by the organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexikos?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents worry about them."</seg>

<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are unimportant compared to pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boys for all the life of violence and he had to learn to live.</seg>

<seg id="807">"but this was not the day, in which his childhood ended."</seg>

<seg id="813">"these are only a few of hundreds of thousands of stories, that leaves the organised crime in Mexico and in the soul of the country."</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories still live up with new headlines. but this project is reminded of those that we may not forget.</seg>

<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project is valid:</seg>
<seg id="1142">"the mass mortar of the languages of the world can be avoided, when we create cities, the diversity accept - safe areas where people must not forget about who they are to belong."</seg>

<seg id="1323">Such words to Zenise will only bring more hate within the various communities.</seg>

<seg id="1400">"a solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform put all Turkish Wikipedia on its decentralized Peer-to-peer network (i.e. calculator connection), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus a complete censorship is difficult."</seg>

<seg id="1480">She reported how this crab created a safe place for these women and have made it at the same time a souvenir inside of the wall.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video, the Rohini showed in their discussion, handled by women who did not call her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided for this issue because they wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which the women can easily identify with.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"the name of their husbands will not be loud to speak, is a brewing that they maintain all over and never asked questions."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Subject:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition confirms that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who do not considers this is regarded as a rescicle as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted for us to this discussion has never been thought about it.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini wanted to try her husband, so far before the name had never seen at home, as it runs."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion with her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>

<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of her husband over the lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra over the boardroom of a century-old tradition, in the married women must never pronounce the name of their husbands.

<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy that they only came out during the whole exercise, a different decided to find out the whole angent frustration against him and his family by taking him."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ekstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"still in adrenaline, with an ancient breach, the women decided that they would actually try at home to call their husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they stopped their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next days Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas they put in the head: his wife could not cease to say his name.</seg>

<seg id="1512">A husband of a group in was less understanding and the situation arted in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women tried to stop other practices, such as the mourning of the zineasiest point on the forehead, who is the spouse:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would wear the cinnoberred point if he also did.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only laughed and I heard that to carry him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women do not have completely heard this, but mean they are now in a better position, even to choose him on some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women the discussion is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we do a trip with every discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I do not want to worry about the women who could hear what could hear," says she. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">"during the last few months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and other things about things that they had never been thought of thought."</seg>
<seg id="1523">Subject:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I also have some things, for example as our identities are knotted, never been honest."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to say certain things according to say, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion we have entertained us through the concept of honor and how to deal with clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only been carried in the group since their Savior.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most of them, the okay, but some wanted to carry a Sala Kurta, a wide shirt above a hosis; they did not move."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after much argument and discussion on the advantages of their own wardrobe, morality associated with the Saris and much more, dirty Rohini gave her own pair of Kurtas (Oberhemden) in a discussion, so that women could carry them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they decided to plan to plan a trip to Goa with whom she can wear jeans and Rohini is certain that they can create it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"back to the question, whether in the five months have been changed since its first discussion, Rohini confirms that things are slowly becoming the roles:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have made only small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women profound it a few times, but then listen to the name of their husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, do not make it yet, but only when they are alone and no other family members are involved."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two say the name of their husbands; only one or two women are contributing at any time interest in their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">"the women in the panel know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives, like the fiction of more freedom of movement or its own wardrobe - at the end of a difficult to navigate river."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by offering each other self-confidence, will become conscious that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"but this club gives each of us the confidence, that something is to change."</seg>
<seg id="1542">"and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families, if every woman goes home in the club home and other people of it, what we talk and what we do."</seg>

<seg id="1698">"the reasons were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in the face of it, he appeared to be unweird undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"he took the idea that Singapore with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York should be compared to equally cities, which are permanently managed by a party."</seg>

<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng demands Shanmugam to prolonged his opinion since it did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country, but a city is to which country is part of our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"hello, I understand nothing."</seg>

<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even certain whether he really believes that he really are associated and aware of what he defends."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review dislay the weak points of Shanmugly arguments:</seg>

<seg id="1731">Nobody ever told that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We always were a town.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island of state.</seg>

<seg id="2085">"I answered with the voice of an exhaustive youth," "my Lord, my Father has to worry."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"be silent and walk you, you will be moved."</seg>

<seg id="2090">The jordan Rapby Emsallam Hdaib responded to the rights of LGBTQ + -community, free expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the photo was recorded by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib spends the bulk of his time inside, sometimes he sdert on his screen, sometimes to his computer, and again to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"but if one can leave, is a cigarette between his fingers or with nicotine inhaled lips."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives in the chief projectile of his family, which had been part of them since 1967; the year, in the Israel ended his cast of the Westbank, and Hdaibs family looked to escape from her village in Palestine in which they had lived as fellowlands (approximately: farmer)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for more than six years, Hdaib is a passionate activist who is opposed to the conservative majority and their altproven opinions regarding gender, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapmusic."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, who often attacking themselves with subjects such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees. all these issues are not only interested in his home country Amman relevance, but also in cities that suffice by Damascus in Syria to Sanaa."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years Hdaib sees itself as a someone who is restricted in his mind, and he can feel according to his own statement with people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries like Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not open it, he weighs a special inclination against the US American foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to do in war, anything to do with his identity as" Palestinian spigrant who has been born in Jordan, even if he was born in Jordan, and so far has never been in Palestine. "</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think because of my own living conditions, says Hdaib."</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he added:" I think so because I am a person, while in water deleted NescafÃ© in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; in this time it is intended for Muslims from sunrise to sunset. "</seg>
<seg id="2105">The jordan law also states that the public discharge of food during Ramadan illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand has a cup of coffee on a senging hot Junitag little with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the slaugings are a warm coffee and the waders of the Kent-cigarette in the nose, primarily of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes the Jordan, feels like a prison under the open sky, especially when you raises a look into the neighboring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it is simply avoidable to do basic things - as in the public during the Ramadan Water - to land not in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Interior of Jordan, has said a performance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"a few parliamentarians who support the Islamic promotional front - the jordan branch of Muslims - argumented, that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontier of Hamed Sinno, the cultural and traditional standards of the country is contradictory and the main reason for the concert."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"members of members and former Press room in the Islamic coalition DIMA Tahboub said in an interview with CNN, that the concert was" "straight" "because of the sexual orientation of the singer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many claim also, the commitment of the band in matters like the Arabic spring, human rights and free expression in the Arab world is more dangerous activism, which poses the old proven legitimacy in the entire region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement Mashrou'Leila the jordan people as" progressive supporter of human rights "" who continue to use for a intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement is probably not easy to seize rhetoric, but actually that reflected a clear-crystalling reality in Jordan that occurs in Hdaibs work clearly."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib traditional generations, having his vision of the fate of Arab women wounded sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of a apparently ludressed woman, whose arms and legs are up to the corners of the canvas."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who actually believe."</seg>
<seg id="2119">"in recent years, the number of" honors "" increased in Jordan - the inofficial outside left. "</seg>
<seg id="2120">Human Rights Watch reached its height. however, the number of honorary infrastructure achieved their climax; however, even though the institutional infrastructure is missing in order to support the women, the victims were tried to support the victims of violence or domestic violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law to despair fighting from the year 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of infamiliar violence, and for their release is often a longlanger bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee on the part of the family, that the woman has nothing to happen."</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is well known to regret not to regret those in his country long as tabular.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib passed that his work is political, however, that he puts his music, which is full of explicit reference to sexuality, freedom and expression, not from politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"come from the Nahost, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"I was immersed in politics," says he. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" "Lawla al 3aib" "and in" "ghareeb" "is the focus on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the list of songs, which are essentially political, can be further developed."</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib published a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it too."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a sort of market, in which one can, in his words," which one wants, "" be faith or non-believe, Hetero or homosexuality. "</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noticed that hardly someone in Jordan is talking about the rights of coils and lesbians and that comments on equality between LGBTQ + -individuals were still censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014 Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular jordan Onlineprogram ROYA to remember that his comments were out of the context, rotated and his opinion had been censored."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was done without snorkelling, but it was only a modified version," says he. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today Hdaib open to the arabic LGBTQ + -community and represents the opinion that intolerance against homosexuals do not be Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentioned Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, which is still remembered thanks to its homerotic poetry in memory."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks yourself: if Abu Nuwhat could work later on behalf of potassists, in the eighth century could be openly writing about homosexuality, why can Jordan?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the Hashemite Kingdom, there is nothing new that the government attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are perspiration."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, January 2017, the jordanic translation service took several former government officials and members of the teacher, with the reason, they would have cried for comments in social media, with the deep in the land sealed corruption."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"given him, the concert Hdaibs agree only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to work a structural uphill in the next generation of the Jordan."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him there is progress a constant glow and take. Jordan, Mashrou'Leila has now become a performance in a row, but the way of progress - it looks for slow, beddings and innerful changes. it is certain that these changes from day to day in the heart of the jordan society will take place."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"finally Hdaib, as millions of other Arabs, even from an Arab world without interventions from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he dreamed not only to bring his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of them."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region with the help of music, art and literature of a real and fundamental openness. approaching - and not by bombs, stretching and artificial art hereated democracies. at least hoped it."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until it is far as far, Hdaib will continue and therefore also resistance."</seg>

<seg id="2187">International was the undersigned of the peace contract as so significant that the Colombian President JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize.</seg>

<seg id="2190">"in turn, the Colombian society in turn, who used to live in constant fear and in some cases deep harass towards Guerillakcent, it has to support them in their ranks and support them in the construction of a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that young columbians would like to close together and would help with the process of integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And this is exactly what they did: until now they have written thousands of young people today - love ships at former Guerillumination to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign are 6900 letters - one for each former Guerillumination which should be personally handed over.</seg>

<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for all involved." it's incredible, how many different feelings can walk in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies in between, "" told the politicians "" Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later. "</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a collaborator of the governor of the province Valle del Cauca. this unforgettable experience so: "</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we passed the letters, brought me a former fighters by the camp of the Guerilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" "Cambuches" "(a kind of hut, where the guerrilla wark live) I saw an Guerillumination which has written something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go, because next to it on the bed lay a MGL Granatcher, a fatal weapon in the thorn-sheep."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"I still spoke him and said," "Hello, what do they just like?" he answered, "I answered a letter that someone wrote."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life someone has written something so nice, therefore I answered him. then I suddenly hit me the tears about the cheeks."</seg>

<seg id="2215">"maybe he was the war sorry, it was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighters, and wanted to help him to write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he never expected anything else from life than war." "I had never thought to preserve him and his six brothers in front of the famine." "I have never thought that someone would be awarded me for my mistakes."</seg>

<seg id="2222">The students were all up and has already been war and the FARC already worked in the dark.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore, the leader of the FARC contributed the history of the organization, its ideals and gave insight into their views over the peace process:" many years we have experienced the social injustice from the state to the whole of the state of the state, we can contribute to a political party, we can help to make society in this country.

<seg id="2228">"but it comforted me that all men - even those who have killed and so much damage caused to give us something and a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, the Archbishop of the city of Cali, the following letter:"</seg>

<seg id="2300">"with her aid I left the land, but then passive somewhat imbalance."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought it, without me to register, without revealing, without everything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checkered to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a foreigner.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"in the moment when I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I got a message:" "you don't believe about, you warns in security, just because you have left the land?"</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know already in which hotel you see. you even know your roomnumber.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it: it is the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was in fact my roomnumber.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However we do not talk about intercourse but this is a tabby topic.</seg>
<seg id="2316">"some traditionally kaukasy elements, I still have in me."</seg>
<seg id="2317">So much I also wish to overcome this seelic barrier I cannot overcome.</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I say that, as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chatting with camera, I actually give me effort as the person looks out of her past - thus to my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But this is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends who have stayed for themselves?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I filed last week a report in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For the needed I need current information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">"I spoke to someone who have entered into argun, half of the months in Argun."</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during the Ramadan, no human being arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of the Ramadan could hardly wait and he concluded a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will focus now on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"with that my me, they probably invite the relatives, they are concerned about the problem with the person concerned person and in the end, an proof that the so-called" honor "is experienced by blood satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are now still flooded in these secrecy products?</seg>
<seg id="2330">"Sabrina: a familiar with me says, there were not very many."</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, above all those who have no rich relatives or were dropped by their relatives were to place Kerrrows Court."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they will be arrested there, so that they can present them later as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say, you should be altered her body on TV and say they would have attacked some village or a military support point."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not easy to disappeared, but targeted to radical."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is now only a mutation or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just have someone who was imprisoned in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have gone again in this prison after her beard had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has since been nothing new of them.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply have taken.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was even better than these people were arrested."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"but until now they were not presented as bandits, there were still no reports. we promise that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would you have not allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"know whether these persecutions and deductions of people who were of a so called" "non-traditional" orientation, already in the past? "</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I have contributed my hair always long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think before 2003 I was already known in Grosny when I lived there - and I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when the sharia, I never had problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia was originally designed to lead us to the" "civilizations", "but has finally rejected us into the Stoneage."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is that possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were cooked, I had colored eyelashes, trug Roundjeans and short Tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The safety of the Scharia has never curved me only a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"before the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every night, especially at weekends, a whole group of people met like me."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several benches were standing, and all the city knew, she knew why men, young people, there met."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never risoned.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the chopian language there is a retreat: Kharda ma Kharda. that is: "Spotte don't say about the unhappiness of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">One says it often to children when talking about cranes.</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they just have their eyes closed before you because they believed, you are sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They have never risoned off, never dreamed and never beaten. "</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long was this mercy seat?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kerrrow entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"as he was appointed Minister of Prime Minister in 2005, he began to speak on TV on morality."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not talk about us, but also about the behaviour of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel how to change people in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">"who previously worked, and succeeded, consider you at once with Argomn."</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel how the situation in the Republic have been constantly lost."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go to?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the US are not much.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that I am still active as a activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim men.</seg>

<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is almond.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"so, nature, which does not have nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Cheches, who want to make you with foam in front of the mouth, that there are no coils with them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestans have which, the cabardine have, which Russians have also which; on the entire planet there are - but not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, so it is to me unpleasant, Soviet."</seg>

<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different types of sensation, to be accurate, different lifestyles."</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important to feel myself in my own skin and not ashamed me for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is an overworked version of the opinion that was published by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the website AfrofÃ©minas. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments under the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I am not a feminist, many women - particularly white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with must."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even place well refined scientific and social arguments against me why I should be feminist and why we generally should all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, that women nowadays are still less money in spite of the same formation as men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women still under strict observation when it comes to what they may do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women sooner or later in various areas of living on a smooth blanket, and that discrimination is still going through the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I am very double and threefold.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black lady.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"yet, if I have to speak on skin colour, on black transient women, on black transient women, on black women in the LGBTIQ congregation, or on black women from the Diaspora; if I have chosen, both in and outside the feminist movement, there were many white feminists and white intersection feminists."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"but they all agree that women - all women - come together in order to raise" their voices, and 'Kumbaya, my lord' to be able to achieve the equality (some) of women. "</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they do not want to talk about it that in addition to sexualised violence is an institutional form of racist motivated violence, which we are exposed black women in two ways."</seg>
<seg id="2450">"or in addition, black women and women of other ethnia and origin are less deserve less than white men and women."</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migrational background of school are referred to as white girl because of obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women are exposed in black spheres and women with migrational background to a higher risk, domestic violence and violence in the partnership, as white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all the women, all men and all men have any skin paint the same rights; on the other hand, I can consider myself to be a black woman in whose center the white woman is to consider themselves, injustices in their thinking that focuses on the sex as well as on the skin color of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">"I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feministic approach, who has always rejected me and innumerable other black women and repeatedly rejected."</seg>
<seg id="2455">"Sojourner bedeed 1851 in her speech:" "I am not a woman?" "and I weighed me to justify an ideology in which the black woman is an uninhabited and marginalized being."</seg>
<seg id="2456">I weigh me to connect me groupings that absorb from cultural expropriation of our seats and customs to advance their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to allow white women to raise the importance of the intersection of skin color and gender, because some of them continue to destroy the importance of black women for the feminist movement totalted, no matter how many black women will try to instruct them for a better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although the intersection of feminism was founded to give women different approaches to a home and to reduce the white feminism, is still the word" Feminism "in his name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I draw it to join me full and completely from feminism, which was initiated for my dark skin and my status as a woman rather than woman in a white-feminist paradigm that is so stubborn that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">"now it is more important than ever before, that we define black women in our own ideas and give us to the spheres that are created by us for us."</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana blanism: reclaiming ourselves (about: Africa-Womanism: how we can create our own way in which they can make ourselves completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, mental, physical and even the spiritual elements can be taught."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersection feminists immediately call separatism and exclusion, after they read these lines, please inform you about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a bluristic environment I can uplift black women and women of other cultures, because in this paradigm I have existed."</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized because of my dark skin and due to my existence as a part of this paradigm.</seg>

<seg id="2486">Break the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women at all time, they receive no support from the part of the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women also depend on the men that they have been misused. this explains why only 20% of all women who admit, victims of violence, at all in the criminal enforcement authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"1 Schlsaw and Statistiken2 Invisible Miscellular and a legal system, that is nothing subjugt3 Paraguays laws: good approach, lack of implementation and statistics"</seg>

<seg id="2506">"in the beginning she did not want, but then still to. this should it be forever."</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos combined. but two years they went to mental violence against women - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most frequently recognizable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I have never thought that I would like to be victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I have read earlier this, I thought that the only women often happens to submissive because they deceive themselves from violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana poled social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without names to name, she wrote contributions on Facebook where she described their insults and various attacks during their two-year relationship and told how he was isolated."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos yourself. he asked rhetoric, whether he ever asked the hand against them and rejected, that his behaviour has also been a form of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why they had fallen for so long from Carlos and left him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">"it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least have some compassion on it."</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos that is not derived from Paraguay, almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner they have been mistaken. "</seg>

<seg id="2521">"their wealthy partner, it finally made it to convince you that she was worthless."</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorian ads in the authorities remained without a result and also by their relatives, she received no support. "</seg>
<seg id="2524">She led a trial against its former partners who developed into a undeniable legal struggle between Paraguay and their home country in which it was mainly for money, power and the influence of their former partner. "</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguays laws: good approach, lack of implementation</seg>

<seg id="2629">Frank Morton breed for the 1980s in the USA salad.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"his company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredgeous, the first plant that has been cultivated by NASA-Astronauts in the space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"almost 20 years long, Morton work was done only by its own influences, and the question how many Salatrops can get boundaries."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000s he noticed that more and more salads were patented, and that he could not be used for breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents applied not only for single varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a specific rotary or green chatted leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"in recent years, more such patents have been registered on more and more plants like grain or cartography. due to this trends provide plant safety, environmental protection and expert security for the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia old tradition, Morton still lettuce, he needs for however longer, since his work is getting more and more likely to be wasted."</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it is, when I lie in a river a boulder, in order to lie down."</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do this now, but it is a fraction with the breeding tradition," says. "I guess that these patents go to Salads."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and when they stand in court, no one can breed a new salads, because all features are already patented. it makes it as good as possible and tries to breed those features that he wants."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very careful and strives to use no material that is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He is also connected to a movement which is getting bigger in the U.S. and all over the world: open Source Breeding ("open source" -breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Motor station ISS at red RÃ¶mersous in the "greenhouse" of the station was bred and eaten. there will be tested whether plants have been cultivated in the space.</seg>

<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather as sounds as if the movement of the IT-area comes from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed initiative (initiative for "Open-Source" -Saatgut) can be inspired by the movement for free "open source" software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was called to life in order to ensure that some plants are protected and -gens are not protected as intellectual property, and so that for plant breeders are permanently used."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"as part of the initiative, in short Ossi, US breeder can commit themselves to us that others can also be free of charge of them."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds." "open source" "breeder only allow others to breed the seed, it's not to cross their own varieties, and it is not immediately banned - two aspects that are banned by many plant patented respectively."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens breeders and seeds have already joined the initiative since its start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the emerified Professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-committee member Jack Kloppenburg are control over the seed, and the opportunity to breed new plants, both important for nutrition security as well as environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"seeds, he plays a role in larger compositions such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by using seeds with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open-source" movement is not busy with gentriical altered plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented if vegetables, Korn, gentry has been altered or not, from organic farming, who's most recent examples from ChemChina and Syngenta and Monsanto and Bayer in the global agricultural industry, it should also know that the way for example, such as this vegetables is bred, is threatened."</seg>
<seg id="2654">Nutritional sovereignty without seed-sovereignty is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative committed to them, others their seeds are still free to provide, so that you are going to patented with seeds, seeds, and plant reformation."</seg>

<seg id="2657">"Ossi-Supper argued that the future of food supplies is at risk, since the available satisfaction is due to the ever payable intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always restricted."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, executive director of the Ossi, has engaged in their doctoral variation with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. it found out that about one third of all cartoons are protected as intellectual property, making it available for plant breeders either not or only aggravated."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants there are such estimates not yet, but experts like Luby confused that massaging plants as wheat are patented in even bigger style as salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of visibility</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants will be so bred that they have targeted characteristics - from such, through which their taste or color increases up to such, because of which they stand in certain environments and threats like pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties refer to that the available plant material for breeder by more and more patents accepting. genetic diversity is currently the necessary conditions due to climate change much worse predictable.</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail address Monsanto-Spreed Carly Scaduto, that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Monsantos activities. with a total of four geography and cooperation with institutions such as the Federal Ministry of the United States."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it does not have to disagree that intellectual property rights other breeders since" patents and protection of plant varietable innovations foster. "" a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow, as soon as the patent is expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to get to the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such an protection, thus innovations not, but encourages to be made available by public more material and know-how."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees the different: 20 years to wait until a patent turned, with certainly no innovations."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you are so long waiting to wait for plants that have adapted to plants that have been adapted to the changed environment, one would have lost the fight."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"but the main location for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general public and should continue to remain:" independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetory incentives are not attractive. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what is driving us, and it will not be impossible, if we cannot use the best and latest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"altogether, Morton went to patcher to patcher:" we create the characteristics not really themselves. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">"the plants form they themselves and as breeders, we finally have no idea how the plants do that."</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the US-State Oregon and Ossi-committee member, there is another important aspect of the plant breeding:" who is a sort of breed, breeders also its own values in them. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"who believes in industrial agriculture with large courtyards and monocultures, which are needed for the cultivation of herbicide, the breeders in its varieties of this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">"my concept is accurate,"</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such that are on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto are) patents have to survive, even without patents to survive - either reject it or keep it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeders Frank Morton is looking for in his kennel salads.</seg>

<seg id="2681">"Morton is also the view that breeders would like to produce the prevention of plant Patents innovative," "it looks like being with my efforts, new to produce, stronger than companies who reindeer."</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I need to be able to sell new material for my catalogue, as I know that my competitor will be selling my varieties in a few years ago," "says he." with a patent a 20 years ago is being protected from competition, which one makes it my opinion quite simple.

<seg id="2684">"in India, the centre for sustainable agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ") which describes itself as professional organization in the field of resources, an" open-source "seed reproductive cities works together with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties which meet certain requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2685">"it also supports them to come to" open Source "seed, and to sell her own."</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German organization Agrecol works on an" open-source "license, which ultimately has an formal and legally binding form of the Ossi-obligation for breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">(regulations for breeding are different from land to country and the Ossi-obligation cannot be taken to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the exekutive of the European Union, the European Commission, explains that conventional plants should not be patented and thus talks about the current practice of the European Patentamts, patents on conventional plants."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation however is not a law; now it is to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent to these new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization of Hivos hosted an conference on" open source "in Ethiopia and representatives of governments, non-governmental organisations and representatives from East Africa to learn something about the" open source "seed movement and the worldwide trend for the sponsoring of seeds."</seg>
