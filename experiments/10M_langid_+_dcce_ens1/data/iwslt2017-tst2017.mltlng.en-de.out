this is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won as New York Times @-@ Times repor@@ ter the Pul@@ se@@ ater prize .
&quot; long before someone heard by Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he were spectacular that the NS@@ A illegal tel@@ eph@@ ones heard of Americ@@ as . &quot;
but it is another chapter who should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence in which the CIA has been literally designs for an atom@@ ic bom@@ b .
&quot; if the crazy sounds , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapter did not fall out ?
the U.S. government .
nearly 10 years long the government is determined against cr@@ acks and calls him to call his inn@@ ate sources .
&quot; in this train he became a symbol for the pattern of the government , whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ers to condem@@ n and journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First constitu@@ tional , the media have the right to publish their secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the sea , which they would like to give . &quot;
&quot; so when the government came to cr@@ acks , he did something that many cour@@ age@@ ous repor@@ ters already did before him : he ref@@ used to go and said that he would rather go into prison . &quot;
&quot; so , from 2007 to 2015 Ris@@ en lived with the risk to go in prison . &quot;
&quot; then , just days before the process , has something extraordinary . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although they were lon@@ gs that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dro@@ pped to cr@@ acks . &quot;
the reason : in time of electronic monitoring the repor@@ ter and sources can always hide less .
&quot; rather than to fail and cr@@ acks to the statements , they could also handle his digital foot@@ ers for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the inv@@ ators , without his consent , without his consent , his phone post @-@ wise secre@@ tly , &quot;
&quot; just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , its credit card , and even irrit@@ ation with the list of his flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condem@@ n Jeff@@ rey Ster@@ ling , a CIA @-@ whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ers and cr@@ acks . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many inst@@ ances . &quot;
&quot; President Obama spoke with his arrival , whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ers . but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condem@@ ned the judi@@ ci@@ ary more than all US governments in front of him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government can get too much of their work as secret . &quot;
&quot; since 11 September , almost every article about national security was the result of that a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ers went to a journ@@ alist . &quot;
&quot; so we set the press work on the game , which should be protected by the first constitu@@ tional , because the government has more and more possibilities to read all of them . &quot;
&quot; but as technology of the government allows to handle the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; and while they can contact them from the moment in which they contact , rather than in the desc@@ endants , in the witness . &quot;
&quot; today , it means communication software , which has not yet been written as Ris@@ en , and it is much more secure as normal e @-@ mails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; a such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open @-@ source monitoring system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ers that was originally developed by the website of Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I work . &quot;
&quot; instead of send an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , as well as the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send information , as with any usual contact form . &quot;
&quot; these will then be enco@@ ded and stored on a server , to which only the respective news agency has access . &quot;
&quot; so the government cannot co@@ ded more information , and many of the information that would demand them , would not be available from prescribed . &quot;
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect freedom of freedom in the 21st century .
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are increasingly developing new es@@ pi@@ on@@ eering technologies , which are all of us at risk . &quot;
&quot; it is for us to ensure that not only technology den@@ omin@@ ator like Edward Snow@@ den have a way to contribute to failure . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ers , &quot;
&quot; the above abuse at the care of soldiers compla@@ in white and of crowded hospitals , alert to the remaining water of F@@ lin@@ t suggests . or a pilgri@@ street in@@ sider that war@@ ned to us before the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover the crime , but to protect our constitu@@ tional rights . &quot;
thanks .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 the largest data l@@ apse of the story published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ aten Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness around an explanation . &#93; this week we have been made of messages about a b@@ acon of 11 million documents that made in Panama
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say , &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . &quot;
&quot; we actually see the em@@ ails , the exchange of messages as the whole system works , as it works . &quot;
this has already led to first very direct consequences .
islands Prime Minister has returned .
&quot; also , there are reports that a allies of the bru@@ tal Syrian dict@@ ators of Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad has changed into tax hav@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; it is asser@@ ted that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend from children &apos;s son , a famous Cel@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people and others , which are nervous about the next release , and the next enth@@ used documents . &quot;
&quot; now , it sounds like the plot of a agencies or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ Romans . &quot;
&quot; it seems w@@ ept away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should us something ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and mighty are able to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens , and not all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and this affects us all .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenomen@@ al . &quot;
&quot; all over the world discuss media and leading politicians , such as secret tax hav@@ ens of some few things to hide and we@@ alth@@ y -- something that we have been discuss@@ ing and beh@@ ind@@ ed for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people will appear very conf@@ using , and it is hard to understand how these tax hav@@ ens function . &quot;
I always imagine it as a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ v .
&quot; so one company has a company in another company , in another company , what it is almost impossible to understand who is behind those bi@@ il@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for pro@@ sec@@ ution and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters . &quot;
I find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter .
&quot; pres@@ um@@ ably , because there were previously no prominent Americans who did in these revel@@ ations on this sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; now , it is not such that there are no rich Americans who hide their wealth in tax hav@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; but through the principle , according to which these tax hav@@ ens function , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has become less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we would have a backup of the Cayman Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming , or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that you need to find less information in some U.S. , less information , to create a company than to get a libr@@ arian reference . &quot;
this kind of in@@ transpar@@ enz in the US has allowed to dis@@ gu@@ ise debt to school@@ children .
it has been frau@@ d@@ able to cut especially attractive investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks into practice .
how does that work ?
&quot; so , we sent a con@@ ce@@ ed war@@ nings to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan . &quot;
&quot; our medi@@ ator gave herself as African Minister , who wanted to bring money into the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
&quot; we really shock@@ ed it really that all up to an attor@@ ney to our invent@@ ory , how he could trans@@ operate its money . &quot;
&quot; these were all pre@@ ferences . none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course none of anyone was handed over to anyone . however , it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important to consider this not as a single acci@@ dents .
it is not a single law@@ yer because of our con@@ ce@@ aled instruc@@ tor proposals .
&quot; it is not about a single peak poli@@ ti@@ cian , wr@@ apped in a sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works , through the corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and to overcome this , we must change the rules . &quot;
we need to change the rules to create this kind of behavior .
&quot; it may sound all very fool@@ ish , as if we could do nothing against it ; as if nothing had ever changed , as if there is always the rich and mighty . &quot;
&quot; but as firstborn optim@@ ist , I see that a lot of change has begun to change . &quot;
over the last few years we have seen prec@@ inc@@ ts to more transparency regarding the owners of companies .
the issue found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
&quot; since then , the EU has recorded in central regist@@ ers at a national level , who really behind companies in Europe and who has controlled it . &quot;
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the US come down here .
&quot; representatives of both parties have brought a bill in both parties chambers , but this does not make progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how this Panama revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , being used in the U.S. and globally for greater transparency . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for changes .
&quot; we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; we need ex@@ ecu@@ tives in the economy , which stand up and say , &quot; In@@ transpar@@ enz is not good for business . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians that det@@ ect the problem and to end this way through laws that this kind of in@@ transpar@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; together , we can finish the in@@ transpar@@ enz , which is now possible to finish this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; this is the story , as I once was almost kid@@ n@@ apped and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da . &quot;
&quot; one day , after I had completed my design study , I made an amb@@ assador . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da remained and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my artwork .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip all the country . afterwards he would go to the cemetery .
I invited him on a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where do you know today for today ? &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I know it not yet .
&quot; and I thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him just ! he says , he would go to the peace Cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really is planning . I will not escape in the trunk of a Maz@@ da land ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
then I heard myself : &quot; I have a bal@@ loon . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; uh , like please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I was then in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceil@@ ing and thought , &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what did I put in ? &quot;
a wild@@ est sleeps in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I got such fear that I got out of the bed , on ten pointed to the door , and my sleeping room closed . &quot;
but he was not even crazy .
we are still in contact .
&quot; the artwork , which he bought by me , depends on his class@@ room . he is now instruc@@ tor . &quot;
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my point of view .
&quot; maybe people who were sold to me in child@@ hood as stran@@ gers , actually friends who were just waiting to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; people on my air@@ waves , normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco I took the air @-@ mate with . &quot;
&quot; do we make a break , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am un@@ employed , almost pl@@ ast@@ ly , my room@@ mates draws up and the rent will increase . &quot;
I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can make it possible to transform fear into fun .
&quot; I wrote to my best friend and new fellow mates Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I could make up something . our apartment will stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , including a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
ha !
we created a website and established so &quot; air conditioning and breakfast &quot; &#91; AI@@ R@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ bn@@ b &#93; .
three Happy guests were allowed to sleep at us for 20 dollars on the avi@@ li@@ et on wood@@ land .
they found it great and we also .
&quot; I am sure that our cheese ham @-@ ham @-@ ru@@ qu@@ ettes are completely different , because we made them for our guests . &quot;
we tour@@ ed with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest and the door to the castle fell on star@@ ched Brian and I found .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and we could pay our rent ?
the things came in rolls .
&quot; my former fellow @-@ room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , completed us as developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out whether you could make it a business concept .
&quot; we presented our investors : &quot; &quot; we want to create a website , looking at the people public@@ ly pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the type of rooms , whose doors are close when visiting . &quot;
over the internet they can relax and invite people to stay with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we wa@@ ited that the miss@@ ile would leave .
indeed they do not .
&quot; no one that is still at comfort , would invest in a shop , the for@@ eig@@ ner allowed to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we have learned as children all that stran@@ gers are dangerous .
&quot; if one has encounter@@ ed a problem , you get on things that you can well . we could be designed . &quot;
at the Kunst@@ akadem@@ ie we learned that design much more is than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it is all experience .
&quot; we learned how to be designed objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who had never met before . &quot;
can design so something ?
is it possible to create design trust ?
&quot; I would like to give you a tasting , what degree trust we do . &quot;
it is a 30 @-@ second experi@@ ment . it will force you from your com@@ for@@ tz@@ one .
thumb high when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
&quot; now , I would like to receive your mobile phone . &quot;
enter your escape cell phone to your left sitting .
&quot; this quiet@@ ly alignment of panic , which you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the first time . &quot;
&quot; for the only thing is more personal than your phone , your home is home . &quot;
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , you will see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to keep the block@@ ed cell phone of a for@@ eig@@ ner in the hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
so also most guests feel when they sleep elsewhere .
only for this reason our company can exist .
only once so who has now Al Gor@@ es Mobile phone ?
could you announce that he advoc@@ ates the Office of the President ?
you can now return the phones .
you have experienced that kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we have changed a small detail to that experi@@ ment ?
&quot; what if your neighb@@ our would have been introduced once with his name ; if he would have told what he comes , like his dog or his children ? &quot;
&quot; imagine , you would have 150 ass@@ ess@@ ments to all say : &quot; he can really keep very well block@@ ed wr@@ inkl@@ es ! &quot;
how would you feel if you would have to enter your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ conc@@ eived feedback system strength@@ ens the trust decisive .
in the beginning we still have some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to give negative ass@@ ess@@ ments .
finally we decided to wait until both the host and guest had submitted their ass@@ ess@@ ments before we asked them online .
last week we have discovered something new .
&quot; we have conducted with Stan@@ ford a study . we investig@@ ated how probably it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are at age and residence . &quot;
little surprising we trust the people most who are at the fast@@ est .
&quot; the more differences we find , the less confidence we trust . &quot;
it is a natural social occurr@@ ence .
&quot; it will be exciting , if you add a person to a person -- in our case through ex@@ ass@@ ess@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; if you have less than three ass@@ ess@@ ments , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but one has more than ten , changes everything . &quot;
a good reputation of simil@@ arities .
the right design can thus help us to overcome some of our deeply ro@@ oted pre@@ ferences .
&quot; in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much one can expect from itself . &quot;
here you can see the reactions to the first news of a guest .
&quot; if one tells about little such as &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; you get rather no answer . &quot;
&quot; if you tell a lot , such as : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request will be rather not accepted .
&quot; thus there is an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; Tol@@ le artwork in your apartment ! I do with my family vacation . &quot;
how can we create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text of recommend to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on what topics you should write something .
&quot; our whole company builds on hope that the right design can help , our pre@@ judi@@ ces against stran@@ gers . &quot;
&quot; whereby we had not reck@@ oned , the large amount of people who were more than willing to set these pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
here you can see how many people are entitled to our offer .
you can recognize three things .
first : unbeliev@@ able good luck .
&quot; second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team . &quot;
&quot; third , a need which was not covered before . &quot;
for us the shop running straight very well .
&quot; of course , there are also times when not everything is smooth . &quot;
there were guests who are allowed to be celebrated or homes with apartments .
hosts have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I have worked in the customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood on the front front when trust has been broken .
there is nothing mal@@ right than this calls . I &apos;m sorry if I just think about it .
&quot; the disappointment that can hear in the voice of An@@ c@@ aller , and will always be our greatest motivation to improve ourselves . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , of the 123 million over@@ sized nights had only a fr@@ action per one problem . &quot;
because people trusted each other way .
when trust works , it is possible to create wonderful . &quot;
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his hosts dro@@ ve him to hospital .
he even don@@ ated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his review :
&quot; perfect house for trav@@ ellers , which ten@@ ds to cardi@@ ovascular disease . &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with enough hospitals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real prot@@ ective angels who save one life even though they do not know it right .
&quot; you drive one in your own car into the hospital , if you die , and waiting for you get a b@@ yp@@ ass . &quot;
because they do not want you feel lon@@ ely and bring them to books .
they can stay even longer without calculate the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
this is how of course not every stay .
&quot; but these relations behind pure cash @-@ trans@@ mit are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy . &quot;
&quot; when I first came about this term st@@ um@@ bled , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the thought of sharing with money @-@ actions together ?
it is a business trading here for an economic trading .
&quot; but it is now just to call &quot; &quot; rent industry &quot; , &quot; the matter is not just . &quot;
share Economy describes a trade , human relationships . &quot;
&quot; people place a part of itself open , and that changes everything . &quot;
&quot; if you travel nowadays , it is easy to compare with Fast Food . it is efficient and reliable , but it is less authentic . &quot;
but what would be a rich buffet made from local impressions ?
&quot; what if at any place you would have visited , a group there would be a thor@@ ough to fill a thor@@ ough and one in a ta@@ vern our district , of which one has never heard before ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking of a five @-@ star chef ?
&quot; nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we would like to design apartments from the ground towards people ?
how would that look like ?
what if cities were the thought of the common share ?
&quot; I imagine cities which allow us society and relationships , instead of sol@@ itude and ab@@ olition . &quot;
&quot; in South Korean capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking that belong@@ ed to the government , &quot;
&quot; now premises were offered . students who were looking for a pencil , &quot;
were given to people whose children were extended . there were inc@@ ub@@ ator@@ programs .
&quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share economy . through our platform alone , night 785 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a for@@ eig@@ ner or even host . &quot;
the idea therefore does not seem so crazy as it was brought to us .
we did not inv@@ ented the wheel .
welcoming there was also previously .
there were already similar websites .
so why did our work work ?
&quot; apart from happiness and timing , that one can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us to overcome pro@@ li@@ fied pre@@ judi@@ ces .
I find that int@@ rigu@@ ing ;
overwhelming .
I have to think every time when a red Maz@@ da continues to pass by me .
we obviously know that design can not solve any problem .
&quot; but if we could help us if it had such great influence , I wonder why we can use design soon . &quot;
thanks .
what do you think if you want to view ?
a believ@@ ing ? a Expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or supp@@ ressed , a brain @-@ washing , a terror@@ ist ? &quot;
or simply a delay in the safety item at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I will not give you bl@@ ame for your negative impressions .
thus the media people represent the look like me .
one study y@@ iel@@ ded that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
Studies show : the Americans think most would have no Muslims .
pres@@ um@@ ably people do not speak to their U@@ ber drivers .
&quot; for all those who have never met a Muslim , it is great to meet you . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee @-@ owner -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra . &quot;
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted
a se@@ am@@ ers @-@ fitness @-@ fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in
&quot; and I am an practic@@ ing , Spir@@ itual Muslim . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga s@@ ings , because , Baby , I was not so born . &quot;
I have decided that .
&quot; when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to emb@@ race me . &quot;
&quot; no , not as hom@@ os@@ exual man , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head@@ gear . &quot;
&quot; my femin@@ ist friend@@ ships were lab@@ eled : &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the sp@@ ouse was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist of independence , and this compared to the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year old , me to a perfect and un@@ achiev@@ able beauty deal . &quot;
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have conclusions .
&quot; I read it , thought upon , exhi@@ bited in question , dou@@ bt@@ ful and credi@@ ted ultimately . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was trust and slow dev@@ otion that deep@@ ened with every reading of the basket .
the beauty of the rhyth@@ m@@ k sometimes brings me to we@@ ep .
I know myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; had you ever feel that someone you perc@@ eive , you fully understand , and yet somehow lo@@ ves ? &quot;
so it feels .
&quot; later I married and began , like all good Egyptians , my career as an engine@@ er . &quot;
&quot; I was later , after my wedding , a child , and lived in basically the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot;
then that hor@@ ri@@ ble morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I was sitting in my kitchen , had an end to finish , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; rush &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; smoke was smoke , aircraft in building , people sp@@ ran@@ ate from the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my Sho@@ ck is quickly turned into rebel@@ lion .
why should you do something like something ?
&quot; I moved the television channel , and heard : &quot; ... Muslim terror@@ ists ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; , ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it has not only been att@@ acked my country but in N@@ u , the de@@ eds from others turned into a sus@@ pic@@ ion . &quot;
on the same day we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and begin with the adv@@ ancement .
I remember how I dro@@ ve me -- as we were silent -- so deeply it went in my seat : and I was det@@ ected for the first time in a Muslim Br@@ ite .
&quot; we moved this night into our apartment , in a new city , where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then I heard , looked , and read the war@@ nings of national Islamic organizations , who poss@@ esses : &quot; be watch@@ ful , &quot; &quot; Sei@@ d careful , &quot; &quot; lead in well illumin@@ ated areas , &quot; &quot; desp@@ ised you not . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
&quot; then it was Friday in that week -- the day , in which Muslims were gathered for prayer . &quot;
&quot; and again , the war@@ nings : &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mosque might be a target . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage of the reporting .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filter@@ ed and I listen@@ ed to att@@ acked by attack on Muslims or by people who were held for Muslims , in the Free offic@@ ers and beat . &quot;
there really gave Bran@@ dan@@ es to mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something felt not right .
&quot; because the people who att@@ acked this country , our country have att@@ acked . &quot;
I have been rej@@ ected the anger of people on the terror@@ ists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to explain to himself .
I have nothing against questions I love questions .
they are the alleg@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; nowadays , we can actually hear people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it says Muslims . &quot;
when will we go out ? &quot;
some people want to combine Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tum@@ or in the body of the USA .
it is only the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tum@@ or is considered as a whole and a ben@@ ign tum@@ or is only under observation .
the alternatives are sensu@@ ous because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tum@@ or in the body of the USA , but a vital organ . &quot;
thanks !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , Er@@ sth@@ el@@ ers and Olympi@@ ans . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques America secure ?
&quot; it may be released a few parking spaces , but do not stop the ter@@ ror . &quot;
&quot; the regular visit of a mosque leads to view people of other faith , toler@@ ant , and larger groups . &quot;
&quot; and like me a leader of the police in the area of Washington , DC recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alized in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alized in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; in the radi@@ al process , one has been found that it starts online . as a first , the person believes that the person believes that the people believe the terror@@ ists are the true Muslims and everyone who desp@@ ised their behavior and ide@@ ology is a betra@@ y@@ al or of faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radi@@ alization , we need to keep people to go to the mosque . &quot;
some will still be asser@@ ted that Islam is a viol@@ ent religion .
&quot; last@@ ly , a group like the IS was founded its bru@@ t@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a man , I think we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
yet we would add ourselves to their imagination world if one sees them as representatives of 1.6 billion belie@@ vers .
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam like the K@@ u @-@ K@@ lux @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ide@@ ology reasons to their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; but if one casts a look at them , it does not drives them what they are blow@@ n in her &quot; Holy Scrip@@ ture . &quot;
it is their bru@@ t@@ ality that lets them read these things into the scrip@@ tures .
an outstanding I@@ mam told me recently an amazing story :
&quot; a girl came to him , because they had gotten themselves to join the IS . &quot;
I was surprised and asked him whether they have been in touch with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said that the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ ergy , with whom she spoke to swe@@ at , and told her that her anger , her sense of un@@ righteousness in the world , they would only bring in trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that had given her anger , it was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization by extrem@@ ists who spoke to a solution . &quot;
this I@@ mam established the connection to God and its community .
&quot; instead of compla@@ ining for their anger , he showed their constructive way for real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what they learned in the mosque , they kept before the IS . &quot;
it was an insight as the Islam@@ op@@ hobia me and my family concerns .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect anyone ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear every day on our democracy based on our thought @-@ freedom ?
a study -- actually show several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear that at least three things happen .
we rather accept a author@@ it@@ arian government system , con@@ formity and pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; a study demonstr@@ ates : if you have reported Test@@ ers messages in which negative for Muslims was reported by military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as the circum@@ cis@@ ion of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academ@@ y problem .
&quot; when you look at when the mood against Muslims under the top sch@@ oss -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terror@@ ist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the advance of the Ira@@ qi war and during two v@@ oting .
&quot; so he is Islam@@ op@@ hobia not simply the natural reaction to Mos@@ lem ter@@ ror , as I expected it . &quot;
&quot; it can actually be a tool to manip@@ ulation the public to explo@@ it the foundation of a free society , the rational and well informed citizens . &quot;
the handling of Muslim is an early war@@ nings .
we might feel it as the first but the tox@@ ic air of fear harm us all .
&quot; during the assignment of coll@@ ectiv@@ ism , it is not just about to explain themselves . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a ath@@ let@@ e .
he was talented in the dental faculty , talented , a lot of promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would say to me that he was the sweet@@ est , generous person who knew them . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; when is from my br@@ other@@ hood , such a se@@ aled young man become ? &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne at her brother and his wife , her neighb@@ our , Cra@@ ig Stephen H@@ icks , she mur@@ dered , the same as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an who was in their apartment , as with an execution , after it was posted on his Facebook page . &quot;
he was eight times on de@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism can not only be un@@ mor@@ ally but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
are we gone to the mosque or we stayed at home ?
&quot; we bes@@ po@@ cris@@ y it and for us it was not an easy decision , for it was about that which we would like to control our children , one that we would control our religion or in which we can exercise our religion . &quot;
we decided to make the mosque .
&quot; with our son in children &apos;s residence , we dro@@ wn , with high pressure to the mosque . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , I went out of my shoes went into the command@@ ment , and what I saw , left me . &quot;
the hall was rest@@ less filled .
&quot; then the I@@ mam made an announcement , thank@@ ed and was our guests welcome , because half of the gathered were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , A@@ thei@@ sts , belie@@ vers and non @-@ belie@@ vers , who have come to us , but to join us . &quot;
at that moment I am coll@@ ap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had the courage and compassion of panic and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what do you choose from the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism ?
will you go on number sure ?
&quot; or if you close to those , which mean : we are better than that . &quot;
&quot; thanks , &quot;

&quot; Helen Wal@@ ters , so D@@ alia , you seem to hit a ner@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; but I ask myself , what do you say those who may say that you are a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a mind with draft are , in a cl@@ assy monument factory , thus one exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
DA@@ LIA Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say that dec@@ eive you not . I am completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; when you look onto the Muslims all over the world , and I did it with the greatest ever carried out the study by Muslim across the world , people want to make ordinary things . &quot;
they want prosperity for the family ; they want to work and they want to live in peace .
&quot; so , I am in no way any resp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; if people appear like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
H@@ W : thank you . DA@@ LIA Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; what began as a platform for Bast@@ ler , just before , a milli@@ ar@@ den@@ ser did . &quot;
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial drugs . &quot;
&quot; before air @-@ packages within our soci@@ etal awareness , has built a autonom@@ ous fleet of aircraft in the Fra@@ c Centre in France live in front of a six feet high tower from 1 500 bri@@ cks . just a few years ago they began to fly with rop@@ es . &quot;
due to consec@@ u@@ tive aircraft high speed and acceler@@ ation on the main space .
you can also build self @-@ consu@@ ming structures also .
they learned how to wear loads with tur@@ bul@@ ences and generally react on natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
&quot; our goal is to exc@@ eed the limits of possible in the autonom@@ ous flight . &quot;
&quot; making a system autonom@@ ous , it must know coll@@ ectively , where in space you find the mobile properties . &quot;
in our laboratory at ET@@ H Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic task@@ ks .
&quot; for today &apos;s dem@@ os , we use a new loc@@ alization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a se@@ ed@@ ling of our laboratories . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the space which should define calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; external commands may be at the highest levels . for example , &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called h@@ edge , &quot;
&quot; a aircraft , which tries to beat two flies with a fl@@ ap . &quot;
&quot; as other star@@ ters , it is efficient in the warm @-@ ward line efficient , much more efficient than heli@@ copter in all its variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most of the starting fle@@ ets , it can flo@@ at , and it has a large advantages at start and land@@ ing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a down@@ side . &quot;
a restric@@ tion of rear @-@ tun@@ ers is that they respond sensitive to tur@@ bul@@ ences such as wind @-@ bows .
we develop new controllers and algorith@@ ms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the aircraft no matter what position the optimal position obtained and the performance can be improved by practic@@ ing .
okay .
&quot; during our research we often represent basic abstract questions , which is at the heart of the matter . &quot;
such a question would be for example : what is the pett@@ y @-@ possible number of mov@@ able parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons to answer the answer to such a question .
heli@@ cop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand mov@@ able parts which car@@ ving to hurt you .
&quot; for decades ago , pil@@ ots could fly remote air@@ plane , which only had two mov@@ able parts : a prop@@ eller and a tail@@ gate . &quot;
&quot; recently , we discovered that flying with just one works . &quot;
&quot; this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechanical easi@@ est @-@ served aircraft . it was inv@@ ented in front of sh@@ ores . &quot;
&quot; it has only a mov@@ able part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; hing@@ es , hing@@ es and Quer@@ ru@@ der , no further actuators or contro@@ versi@@ es , just a prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechanical simp@@ el , happens in the interior live very much so that it can fly stable and move in space to move in space . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorith@@ m of the tail@@ gate . to bring it to flying , I have to throw it right . &quot;
&quot; the pro@@ bability , it is right to throw it , when I watch all , is low , therefore I &apos;ll show you a video that was fil@@ med yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is a practice in genom@@ ics , this machine is here , the Omni@@ kop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , a exercise in abund@@ ance . &quot;
what to do with all this con@@ flu@@ ence ?
they see that he is still symmet@@ rical .
&quot; therefore , it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment . &quot;
&quot; thus , he receives the au@@ xili@@ ary ability , &quot;
&quot; to move in space in all directions , no matter which direction he is fil@@ med or even as he rot@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the field of interactive rivers by eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; some is able in models , the rest will be learned directly at the catch . &quot;
see us this .
&quot; if planes should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reli@@ ably . &quot;
this machine consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller planes .
this turns out in the c@@ lock@@ wise direction
and the other against the c@@ lock@@ wise direction .
&quot; when one builds them , it beh@@ ave like a high @-@ performance square . &quot;
&quot; however , something wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine as well as restricted . &quot;
we will now demonstrate that we can make a half a half .
the last demonstration studied synthe@@ tic vibrations .
the large number of autonom@@ ous , coordin@@ ated units allows a range of a@@ esthetic expression . &quot;
we took the usual micro @-@ Quad@@ copter -- each individual weigh@@ s less than one disc bread -- and stat@@ ues them with loc@@ alization technology and algorith@@ ms .
each unit white where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no limit .
hopefully you will motiv@@ ate these demonstr@@ ations to develop new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly secure machine as it would like to put on Broadway a flying shade .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to predic@@ t the influence of these technology . &quot;
for types like us the re@@ ward lies in the development and the cre@@ ators .
&quot; it serves as memory , how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it perm@@ its creative to clever creatures , they are in so spectacular fashion . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such a massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the i .
&quot; thanks , &quot;
&quot; over 1.3 billion years ago in a very far distant galax@@ y , two black holes each other is getting faster , they turned the mass of three sun@@ bathing in pure energy . &quot;
these short moment long illumin@@ ated them bright@@ er than all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of the whole of us well @-@ known universe .
it was a very big bang .
but your energy put them free in the form of light free --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was submitted into the space @-@ time feelings themselves and the universe explo@@ ded in Gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
arrange the events initially tim@@ ely .
1.3 billion years ago the first life was created on Earth .
&quot; since then , Earth has brought some things : cor@@ als , fish , plants , s@@ aur@@ ier , people and -- God like us with -- even the internet . &quot;
&quot; for about 25 years ago , a group of particularly bra@@ ve -- R@@ ai Weiss founded by MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ Tech -- a huge laser det@@ ector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which arise about col@@ li@@ dity black holes . &quot;
most of them stopped them for crazy .
&quot; but enough people recognized them as crazy Gen@@ ies , so that the US National Science Foundation was finan@@ ci@@ ally financed by the US National Science Foundation . &quot;
&quot; after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely hard work built it the det@@ ector LI@@ GO : the Laser @-@ Inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ er- Gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ Observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in tort@@ ure , the precision of LI@@ GO could considerably be increased to the precision of the LI@@ GO . &quot;
therefore it is now called Advanced LI@@ GO .
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 LI@@ GO was started to clari@@ fy some smaller , stu@@ b@@ born problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , just a few days after the start @-@ up of the det@@ ector , the gra@@ vity of the two col@@ li@@ ons black holes through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott Hug@@ hes : just two moments in my life were emotional as this :
the birth of my daughter
and the far@@ ewell from my to@@ w cran@@ ks father .
basically the fruits of my life @-@ works .
&quot; all that , for I had worked , is no longer Science Fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colle@@ ague Scott Hug@@ hes , theoretical physi@@ cian in black holes and their by observ@@ atory such as LI@@ GO meas@@ urable signals . what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ation wave is a cranes in the feeling of space and time .
&quot; when moving the wave , the space and its accum@@ ulated content is stret@@ ched in one direction and put into the other . &quot;
&quot; to illustr@@ ate teachers in courses for Rel@@ ativity to Rel@@ ativity , often a really fool@@ ish dance . &quot;
&quot; stretching and dust , stretching and dust . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ri@@ dic@@ ulous . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September , for example , each of us was stret@@ ched out of the shaf@@ ts and de@@ pl@@ eted . the stretching of an average man was 10 high 21st . &quot;
&quot; that is said 20 N@@ ul@@ len after the com@@ ma , followed by a 1st lo@@ an , the LI@@ GO @-@ employee explained for crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five kilometers long laser det@@ ector , and that is already ab@@ sur@@ d , this length would have to be measured on less than a thousand light of the radius of an atom@@ ic kern@@ els . &quot;
at the end of his classical text about gra@@ v@@ itation
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Light , the hunt for the waves of the following : &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ c@@ ists are in@@ ventive , and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
Scott said to LI@@ GO . Scott said to LI@@ GO was more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wav@@ el@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : faces , size of your mobile phones . &quot;
this is quite convenient . because so you can finish a picture or map of things by taking the coming out of several points coming light around you .
in pots this is different .
&quot; heard sounds , have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 meters . &quot;
&quot; therefore it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that make you particularly much : &quot;
the face of your child approximately .
&quot; instead we listen to certain properties such as tape and height , rhythm and volume to close to the history behind it . &quot;
&quot; now , he just speaks Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob inter@@ rup@@ ts it . &quot;
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
the same applies to Gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
with them there are no simple pictures of objects in all .
&quot; but by changing changes in the amp@@ l@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least for LI@@ GO the measured frequencies in the audi@@ ble area .
if we convert shaft pattern in scar@@ fs we can hear the all literally speak .
&quot; gra@@ v@@ itation of the gra@@ v@@ itation , can give us a lot about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , with which my colle@@ ague Scott has been very long busy . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , not rot@@ ating holes , cir@@ cus simply : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; turning the two bodies very fast , you can hear the same cir@@ cus with an additional audio change . this sounds so on : W@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u ! &quot;
&quot; it is a kind of movement , characterized by wav@@ e@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date , which at least I must never forget -- listening to this : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ des quiet@@ ness &#93; Jem@@ and who knows how to hear it , recognize this as a device of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fa@@ cher paras@@ ol that turn around as quickly as the sticks of your mix@@ ers . &quot;
AA : we think about what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the g@@ est body in all , one with a mass of 29 son@@ nen , the other with a mass of 36 Son@@ nen , sur@@ rounds one hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
20@@ .08.2015
and we know it because we have heard it .
ther@@ ein lies the Perman@@ ent meaning of LI@@ GO .
LI@@ GO was a completely new path to exploring the universe as they never had previously been possible .
on this way we can listen to all and hear the invisible .
much in all we can see -- practically or basically -- not see .
&quot; a Super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars in Super@@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de . &quot;
they are very useful . of them we learned much about space .
&quot; but the exciting physical events occur in the core , which is behind thousand kilometers of iron , carbon and si@@ licon hidden . &quot;
&quot; we will never go through , as these op@@ ak are . &quot;
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penet@@ rate iron , as if it would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we would never see her the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them as the Ur@@ g@@ all is covered by its own offspring . &quot;
the help of gra@@ vit@@ ational shaf@@ ts should be possible to re@@ look back to the beginning .
&quot; and that is most important : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen we have never seen , and of which we have no idea . things we only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , LI@@ GO found right in the first sight of things that we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colle@@ ague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the LI@@ GO project , says to this topic : me : the type of stars , the black holes , such as LI@@ GO they observed , are the din@@ osaur@@ s of the universe . &quot;
they are trem@@ endous , ancient body from pre@@ historic times . the black holes are to speak for our archaeological work . &quot;
&quot; LI@@ GO gives us a totally different angle on the events in all , on the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we went out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge is now to be as cour@@ age@@ ous as possible .
&quot; thanks to LI@@ GO , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and sound and cir@@ cus of the cosmos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atory on Earth and All .
because what could be more beautiful than the Ur@@ g@@ all of yourself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
Dre@@ ams with us .
thanks .
some time ago I tried an experi@@ ment .
&quot; a year long I would say to all &quot; yes ! &quot; say , in front of I fear@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; no matter whether it made me nervous to me in un@@ pleasant situations , I would like to say &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
wanted to speak in the public ?
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
wanted to be live on TV ?
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
wanted to start playing with the swing ?
&quot; no , no , no , yes , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly that to do , w@@ ov@@ or I for@@ ged my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear , speech@@ es , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , weg . &quot;
the power of one word is impressive .
&quot; yes , has changed my life . &quot;
&quot; yes , changed me . &quot;
&quot; but there was a certain Yes , that changed my life in deep , at an un@@ expect@@ edly . it started with a matter of mine vic@@ tories . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls for in@@ explic@@ able reasons all &quot; &quot; sheep , &quot;
as if they were a wa@@ it@@ ress out of the south .
&quot; sheep , I needed milk for my snor@@ k@@ eling . &quot;
she asked me once I could play with her when I was just on the le@@ ap . and I said : &quot; yes . &quot;
this yes was the beginning
&quot; a new life @-@ setting in my family . from there I swe@@ ar to play with them , as soon as you go on . no matter what I just do , or where I go , I am always yes -- every single time . &quot;
almost . I am not perfect but I make me very much .
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , on my children , on our family . &quot;
&quot; but it also has an amazing side @-@ effect : first , I was actually completely understood that the &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; for playing with my children my career saved . &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am author . I think of things I think about life .
dream @-@ Multimedia
&quot; Hi , &quot;
I am a Titan .
dream @-@ Multimedia
I create television . I produce television .
I do television in a great style .
&quot; in this TV season I am responsible for it , 70 hours of program to go into the world . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
&quot; each show provides hundreds of jobs , which did not exist . &quot;
the budget for a episode of a television program can be between three and six million dollars .
say we five .
&quot; new episode all nine days of four shows , so all nine days 20 million dollars , four TV programs , four hours TV , three Shows , while at the same time : 24 epis@@ odes : grey &apos;s , 21 epis@@ odes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 epis@@ odes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of television &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV ser@@ ien walk at each other on Thursday night .
all over the world run my series in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spect@@ ators .
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours , ship@@ ments I create , and not only produced , so still ob@@ end@@ lessly . I must find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans in stock and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four Television , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 millions of dollars , bon@@ fire that burn around the world . &quot;
do you know who that still does ?
&quot; no , of this reason I am a Titan . &quot;
dream @-@ Multimedia
I would not like to print them with this .
&quot; I say it , because I know what you think when the word &quot; author . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I say it to you so that all of you who work so hard if you are now a company , a country or a class@@ room to take me seriously when I am talking about work , so that I say not only at the computer , and it is true if I say , I understand that it does not work with a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it is all a job , all work , all reality , all the blood , all swe@@ at -- not t@@ ears . &quot;
I work much , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I am deep@@ ened into the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country from now@@ here .
&quot; it is , as I set troops on , when mal@@ te I put on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; as dreams , there is a high tone , like a mar@@ athon . &quot;
you feel like Bey@@ onc@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love to work it .
&quot; it is creative , mechanical , str@@ en@@ uous and ber@@ r@@ ally , funny and dist@@ urb@@ ing , clin@@ ically and mother@@ ly , cru@@ el and reasonable . and the best thing is the su@@ ms . &quot;
there is such a change in me when working well runs .
&quot; a su@@ ms starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the su@@ ms listen to as a lively street , I could always go on her . &quot;
&quot; many people take to them , when I talk to them the su@@ ms that I am writing , that the writing was made me joy . &quot;
&quot; do not understand me wrong , what does it do . &quot;
&quot; but the su@@ ms -- when I started working with the TV production , when I began to work and to work and to build , I discovered this thing , this su@@ ms , this energy . the su@@ ms ! &quot;
the su@@ ms is more than writing .
the su@@ ms is action and activity . the su@@ ms is a drug .
the su@@ ms is music . the su@@ ms is light and air .
the su@@ ms is the voice of God in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a su@@ ms , then you cannot stri@@ ve any other than according to size . &quot;
&quot; feel , not different to stri@@ ve than to stri@@ ve , no matter what price . &quot;
this is what we call the su@@ ms .
or maybe it also means a work@@ a@@ holic to be .
maybe it is called geni@@ us .
maybe it is called ego .
maybe it is the fear of failure .
I know it not .
&quot; I know only that I am not for failure , and I know only that I love the soup . &quot;
&quot; I just want to say to you , I am a Titan , and I know that I will not ask it into question . &quot;
&quot; in order to make a clear thing : the more successful I will , the more broad@@ casts , the more over@@ thro@@ ws , the more work there , the more things at the same time , the more things get my story , the more my expectations , so much more expectations there is . &quot;
&quot; the more I work , to be successful , the more it needs to work . &quot;
and what do I say about work ?
I love work but not true ?
&quot; the land , which I sc@@ aff@@ e , the mar@@ athon , which I lower , the army , the high tone , the su@@ ms , the su@@ ms . &quot;
I like this sw@@ amp . I love the su@@ ms .
I needed the su@@ ms . I am the su@@ ms .
am I only this su@@ ms ?
and then stops the su@@ ms .
&quot; re@@ vised , super@@ vised , burned . &quot;
the ad@@ mmen stops .
&quot; now , my three daughters are used to the truth , that their m@@ um is a single work of work . &quot;
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mom will not be there , but you can write my ni@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; sheep , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da land . &quot;
there are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
you are Baby @-@ Tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the ad@@ sil@@ ly heard . &quot;
the su@@ ms of the engine stu@@ b@@ bled .
I did not love my work anymore . the engine was out .
the su@@ ms came not back .
my su@@ ms was broken .
&quot; made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , crossed Week@@ end , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ates , a Titan sleeps , does not cover , with full heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no su@@ ms .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a preview of Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the su@@ ms and the su@@ ms I was .
&quot; so what do you do if what you do , the work that you love , suddenly f@@ aded ? &quot;
&quot; I know , some may think : &quot; &quot; Heu@@ l thee , bl@@ ö@@ der author @-@ Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know it , you do what you do is , you love to be a teacher , a painter , Bill G@@ ates , and knows how to stops the su@@ ms when the su@@ ms stops , who is then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; if the song of my heart list@@ ens , I can survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; a question .
&quot; I am on the way to outside , late dr@@ an and she says : &quot; Mama , mag@@ st you play ? &quot;
and I want to say No to me than two things are aware of :
&quot; first , I must say yes to all and second@@ ly , she called me not . &quot;
it is not called any more &quot; sword . &quot;
when is this happened ?
&quot; I miss it when I am Titan bin and my soup , and here everything changes from my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; Mama , mag@@ st you play ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; yes . &quot;
it is nothing special .
we play and their sisters we lau@@ gh a lot and I read quite dram@@ atically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding , because my pain and my panic , in the lon@@ eliness and the absence of summ@@ ing , I can do nothing except . &quot;
I am focused .
I am silent .
&quot; the land , which I sc@@ aff@@ e , the mar@@ athon , which I lower , the army , the high tone - they do not exist anymore . &quot;
&quot; everything that exists are sti@@ cky finger and dam@@ p kis@@ ses , delicate voices , guard@@ ed voices , guard@@ ed and the song in which it goes wrong , or whatever the girl in &quot; &quot; the ice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so barely that I can barely breathe .
I can barely believe that I breath@@ ed .
play is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes on and an energy @-@ attack is coming .
&quot; and this is not immediately , but it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the su@@ ms comes slowly back .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it is silent , hardly heard , but it is there . &quot;
&quot; not the ad@@ sil@@ ly , but a su@@ ms . &quot;
and now I feel as I would like to know a magic secret .
but let us remain with the matter .
it is love . this is all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something that we have forgotten .
&quot; the su@@ ms , the male summ@@ ers , the Titan@@ ic summ@@ en , which is just the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I am compla@@ int with the help of broad@@ casts and TV hours , and how do I get my brain , then I have forgotten what the real su@@ ms is . &quot;
the su@@ mming is not strength and it is not too specific .
it is dependent upon the joy .
the true su@@ ms is dependent on love .
the su@@ ms is the stream that comes from life .
the true su@@ mming is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; the real su@@ ms ignor@@ es the pressure of the story , which lead to done tasks , the expect@@ ation and the pressure . &quot;
the real su@@ ms is simple and original .
&quot; the real su@@ ms is the voice in my ear , but perhaps whis@@ per@@ ed me God the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan am ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a bit more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
I do this for a fixed rule that I can deliver me as a work@@ a@@ holic from any fault .
&quot; it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice when I want to hear the sw@@ amp again . &quot;
I wish it would be so simple . I am not good in playing , I like it . &quot;
&quot; do not play anything like working , like working . &quot;
the truth does hur@@ ts ;
but I like it not to play .
&quot; I am always working , because I love it . &quot;
I prefer to work at the workplace as home .
&quot; this race con@@ fes@@ sion is pain@@ ful , because what a human being works better than to be home ? &quot;
&quot; yes , I . &quot;
&quot; honest , I call myself &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
&quot; that I am to relaxed , is none of them . &quot;
&quot; we ras@@ en in the garden around , before and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play Ball .
we cru@@ el soap bu@@ b@@ bles .
&quot; here I feel largely sti@@ ff , ab@@ sent and conf@@ used . &quot;
I will always go to my mobile phone .
but it is OK .
&quot; my kids show me how to live , and the su@@ ms of the universe filled me . &quot;
&quot; I play and play , until I ask myself : why did we have heard the games ever ? &quot;
you can also ! tell us yes if your child wants to play with you .
maybe hold me for na@@ ï@@ ve for a day@@ dreams .
&quot; you may well right , but you can do it ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not Ri@@ h@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et @-@ show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little wish to play at most 15 minutes with me until they fa@@ ils to make them something different .
&quot; there are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes I have replaced a pupp@@ et or cookie .
&quot; and speak my teen@@ agers , whole 15 minutes long with me , I am the mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; there are only 15 minutes , more needs it not . &quot;
&quot; everybody can bring about 15 minutes on the piece , even on a bad mood . &quot;
15 minutes a piece !
&quot; no cell , no laundry , no di@@ str@@ action . &quot;
the day is short : dinner that make children ready .
but 15 minutes are dr@@ in !
&quot; my children are my well @-@ being , my world . there must not be the children . it is to feel the su@@ ms to have a place for his soul . &quot;
it does not go for playing with your own children . it is about joy .
around the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
treat the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find out it and keep it out .
I am not perfect in it . I fail and I si@@ ege . friends meet you can read the day --
&quot; want to play ? &quot; &quot; is short for everything I abandoned , when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in education , when I wanted to meet myself more and more . &quot;
15 minutes in the piece why not full 15 minutes away ?
what can it be wrong ? nothing !
the su@@ ms came back in my spare time . the su@@ ms seems to return if I don &apos;t work .
working does not work without play .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months , a door opens up a door , and I find myself in my office . I hear a unknown mel@@ ody , it filled me and my soul . I listen to new ideas . I can sei@@ ze it in full bre@@ wing and love my work again . &quot;
I like the su@@ ms but I love it .
I do not need it .
I am not the su@@ ms of the su@@ ms is not me ... no more .
soap bu@@ b@@ bles and sti@@ cky finger , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is now my su@@ ms .
the ad@@ sil@@ ly of life .
the su@@ ms of love .
&quot; the su@@ ms of the work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful . &quot;
it is my nu@@ ppe that I am a Titan I . I have never seen a Titan before the trip to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and to more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the more happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel like a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more clear is my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sw@@ ms . the land I sc@@ aff@@ e the mar@@ athon , the mar@@ athon , the su@@ ms , the su@@ ms , the su@@ ms , the other , the right su@@ ms : the su@@ ms of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this ad@@ ly , the more makes this unusual , illustr@@ ating , naked and new way of life in me wide . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this su@@ ms , the more I know who I am . &quot;
I am author . I think of things I aw@@ aken you to life .
&quot; this belongs to the job , which means to live his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
for a dream job should be a little dream@@ y .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and to more games .
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot;

I am Neuro@@ surgical .
as most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trag@@ edi@@ es .
&quot; I know how to change your life from one second to the other , after a heavy stroke , or after a car . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ ons it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other bodi@@ ly organs , has a very low capacity to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a serious violation of the central nervous system , patients often have a lasting , heavy disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I was functional neuro@@ surgery .
what is a functional neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ on ?
a doctor who tries to improve the ner@@ ve functions by different surgical measures .
&quot; they have heard them from one of the most prominent , the &quot; deep @-@ ir@@ m@@ ulation &quot; . &quot; they implan@@ ted an electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the cir@@ cuits of neur@@ ons so that the neurolog@@ ical function improves . &quot;
it truly is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson who suffered severe pain in trem@@ endous trem@@ bling and heavy sor@@ eness .
neuro@@ modul@@ ation however does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ ons is the recovery of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to you .
with a little help you can help the brain itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was conduc@@ tive Ober@@ är@@ z@@ tin and worked day and night in the emer@@ gency .
often I found patients with Schä@@ del @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ Trauma .
you have to imagine that at Schä@@ del @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ mat@@ a die brain and the sk@@ ull pressure .
to save life it is necessary to min@@ ate the sk@@ ull @-@ pressure .
this is sometimes necessary to remove a part of s@@ wollen che@@ ek .
&quot; instead , instead throw away , we decided to analy@@ ze with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist to analy@@ ze the brain . &quot;
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; cells from a consci@@ enti@@ ty grow , is comparable with very small children who will be taken from your families . &quot;
&quot; you must find the correct nutrition , temperature , moisture and the environments to cut them . &quot;
that &apos;s what we had to do with these cells .
after many cont@@ amin@@ ated it Jean @-@ François .
he saw it under his micro@@ scope .
this was a great surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked like a regular cell culture . with large green cells that are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells . &quot;
perhaps you still know from the bi@@ ologist that stem cells are un@@ mature cells that can transform themselves into any cell type of organism .
&quot; the adult brain has tri@@ m cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , little ni@@ che of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to obtain this kind of tri@@ bal cells from the surface tissue of the brain &apos;s mass in the surgery .
we made an additional fascinating observation : normal tri@@ m cells are very active -- they share very fast .
they never die ; they are immort@@ al .
but these cells remained different .
they split slowly and after a couple of weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell@@ ular population that looked like tri@@ m cells , but in different . &quot;
&quot; we needed for a long time to understand , where they came . &quot;
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells hot Dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
you will make 4 % of our large @-@ hir@@ s bas@@ ins .
you play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fo@@ etus they ensure the folding of the brain .
but why do they remain us ?
we do not know that .
&quot; we believe that they take part in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concent@@ rations near bra@@ in@@ jur@@ ies . &quot;
but this is not so certain .
but one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our regul@@ ators .
&quot; we stand before a potential cell source , which allows bra@@ ins . &quot;
we had to prove this .
&quot; so , we decided to develop an experi@@ ment . &quot;
we wanted to take a piece of brain from the non @-@ lingu@@ istic area and then the cells differ exactly as cul@@ tured as it did Jean @-@ François .
and they are then colour@@ ful to follow them in the brain .
in the last step we implan@@ t it on the dra@@ fting of the same .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ian tran@@ splantation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splantation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we are exp@@ ecting these cells in norm@@ ative brain tissue ? and what will happen if we cross the same cells in your business tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with monkeys .
&quot; in the first scenario we de@@ cess@@ ed the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that they had been completely taken after a few weeks when they were back home . the room is already occupied , they will not be used there , so they disappear . &quot;
in the second scenario we added a violation of and investig@@ ated exactly the same cells and now remained the cells -- they want to mature neur@@ ons .
here you can see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have res@@ orted .
&quot; proof that they show are these small points . these are the cells , which we are in vit@@ ro , in the culture . &quot;
&quot; here , we were not able to stop . &quot;
&quot; do these cells also help a monkey , yourself from a shepherd hur@@ t@@ ness to recover ? &quot;
so we trained monkeys with a manual version task .
they had to take feed @-@ p@@ ell@@ ets from a tray .
this made them very good .
&quot; when they reached a solid skill level , we owe it to the motor@@ ic Cortex the hand@@ mot@@ ori@@ k area . &quot;
&quot; then the monkeys were par@@ aly@@ zed , they could no longer move her hand . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen with people , they recover spont@@ aneously up to some degree , just like after one stroke . &quot;
&quot; the patients are par@@ aly@@ zed , and then try to relax with the help of plas@@ tical brain mechanics . you can recover yourself at some degree , just as the monkey . &quot;
&quot; when we were sure that the monkey had achieved its degree of spontaneous recovery , we implan@@ ted his own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left side they see the monkeys , which spont@@ aneously recover . &quot;
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance against injury .
it is not so accurate and not so fast .
&quot; now you see , when we did the cells implan@@ ted : the same monkey , two months after the implan@@ tation . &quot;
I can tell you that were also very exciting outcomes .
since this time we have found much more about these cells .
we can take them fre@@ ez@@ ing and later use .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models using Park@@ inson .
&quot; but our dream is still getting to implan@@ t them with man . &quot;
I really hope that I can show you soon as we give human brain the means to he@@ al themselves .
&quot; thanks , &quot;
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ ely@@ ne , this is wonderful , I am sure that now , several do@@ zen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who need this . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question of what the biggest obstacles are , before you can start clinical studies at the people . &quot;
J@@ oc@@ ely@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill out about two kil@@ og@@ rams and forms of forms to go through this kind of studies .
BG : this is understand@@ able , the brain is very del@@ ik@@ ous etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it needs a long time , a lot of patience and a nearly professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get the permission to start of clinical tri@@ als . if you go further into the future , how many years will take it until someone can come into hospital and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : this is difficult to say .
initially it depends on the approval of clinical study .
will it allow us to start the authority soon ?
then it is necessary to perform this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it has been a long time to select patients , the treatments perform and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment . &quot;
then you have to apply it on a multi @-@ cent@@ ric study .
&quot; one must first prove that it is useful , before you can offer this treatment every one . &quot;
BG : and that it is sure of course . J@@ B : natural .
BG : J@@ oc@@ ely@@ ne : thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it .
BG : many thanks .
democracy .
we in the West do a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the frag@@ ile plant that is in reality , but as the invent@@ ory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider them as un@@ change@@ able circumstances .
we believe that capitalism leads to democracy .
this is true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great offspring in Beijing have dou@@ bts about that it is possible to have a blo@@ oming capitalism and impressive growth while the politics remains completely und@@ em@@ ocr@@ atic .
&quot; indeed , democracy in us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made clear to me as a financial crisis in Euro@@ group , our elections -- not the au@@ sterity policies may not affect the au@@ sterity that were realized in Greece . &quot;
&quot; in this moment I thought that there could be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my sinc@@ er@@ ous friends that would be repeated , if it would change anything . &quot;
at this point I would like to introduce an economic model to a real democracy .
&quot; I ask you to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , we could not save democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ ending democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy our societies are committed to our future , our future , and our great , new technologies are wast@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of wast@@ age , I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction , who currently threat@@ ens our econom@@ ies . &quot;
I burn it to the &quot; Z@@ will@@ ings@@ gi@@ pfel @-@ Par@@ ad@@ ox . &quot;
&quot; one summit is known to you . you know and recognize it as the Schul@@ den@@ berg , who ra@@ ises his long shadow over the US , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
we all recognis@@ e the Schul@@ den@@ berg
but only a few recognis@@ e his f@@ ake .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to an@@ ist au@@ sterity and corporations , however , who could hold there , where it would be productive and income to produce , with which you need to produce the Schul@@ den@@ berg and also all the things that humanity urg@@ ent need for example , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; in the past 3 months were invested in the USA , in England and in the euro@@ zone 3,4 Bil@@ li@@ ons US dollars , such as industrial buildings , schools , roads , track , equipment and so on and so forth . &quot;
&quot; 3,4 Bil@@ li@@ ons US dollar sounds after a lot of money , until one with the 5,@@ 1 Bil@@ li@@ ons US dollar hol@@ ders that at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did , except the bor@@ ro@@ cities and the real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus , deb@@ ts and un@@ productive capital is the Twins apples which are not sufficient through the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result are stag@@ able w@@ ages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 year@@ ling in the US , Japan and Europe un@@ employed , which might not invest in a final demand in which they would not invest . just like Ö@@ di@@ p@@ us Father , who is out of fear , the prophec@@ y of the Ira@@ qi may be true that his son would kill him if he will grow , &quot;
un@@ stri@@ pped the circumstances that lead to that Ö@@ di@@ p@@ us kill him k@@ ills .
this is my ha@@ dern with capitalism --
&quot; its superf@@ icial Article All the un@@ productive capital should be used to develop our lives , human tal@@ ents and especially to finance the technologies of &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for saving the earth . &quot;
thus democracy is the solution ?
I think . but before we continue : what do we understand by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the social form of control in the outdoors and the poor as a majority of government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy naturally closed too many of --
&quot; women , for@@ eig@@ ners , and of course sl@@ aves . &quot;
&quot; however , there would be a mistake , the importance of ath@@ etic democracy based on these outputs . &quot;
&quot; the decision on the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that they were working in the working of the arms , but not only the right to freedom of expression , but important and crucial that they have the right to political participation of equal rights in issues of heads . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy does not have kept a long time --
&quot; like a cand@@ le , which is very bright lights , it is also quickly burned . &quot;
&quot; however , our present liberal democr@@ acies have not their roots in ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glori@@ ous revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the ath@@ ic democracy focused on the free citizens , and the working group &apos;s poor forces , based on our liberal democracy based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which was ultimately a stat@@ ute for ruling class . &quot;
&quot; for the liberal democracy only came to , as a complete separation of politics and economy and the democratic process was introduced to politics , while the economy - thus the world of corporations -- a democratic free zone . &quot;
&quot; in our present democr@@ acies has been taking place since the time , in which this separation of politics and economy began to mig@@ h@@ ate the imm@@ unity between the two by taking the economy gradually appro@@ aching politics , and it escap@@ ed them . &quot;
wonder why politicians are no longer like earlier ?
it is not on a de@@ generation of their DNA .
&quot; it is that one cannot be in the government nowadays , and still not in power , because the power of politics is pic@@ ked up into the economy and the areas are separate . &quot;
I mentioned my ha@@ dern with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is like a herd of rob@@ ber@@ y that have so sustain@@ ed the animals , of which they are nour@@ ished , de@@ clin@@ ed that it is thus hung@@ ry . &quot;
&quot; similarly , it is similar to the economy that politicians are so far from the self @-@ condem@@ ned crisis itself . the power of the corporations is growing , political frei@@ ght@@ ness increases , the overall demand falls and the managing directors of the corporations are to be imp@@ ris@@ oned to safegu@@ ard the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful of capitalism the &quot; &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &quot; the people &#93; out of democracy , the higher the Gem@@ ma summit , and the greater the dis@@ ing of human labour power and the prosperity of hum@@ ank@@ ind . &quot;
&quot; if that is wrong , it is obvious that we have to bring the politics and the economy back , and it would be better if the &quot; &quot; dem@@ os &quot; &quot; control , as in the ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of sl@@ aves , women and for@@ eig@@ ners . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
the Marx@@ ist left this idea had already been 100 years ago and it was not very good .
the teaching from the deb@@ acle of the Soviet Union should be that the working group is poor only by a mar@@ vel of a position as in ancient Athens without creating new species of bru@@ t@@ ality and wast@@ age .
but there is a solution : to create the working poor !
capitalism does it by drawing Ni@@ ed@@ rig@@ worth@@ while replaced by Automation and ro@@ bots .
&quot; the problem is , so long business and politics are separate areas , the automation summit will be higher , the wast@@ age dump , and the social conflicts deeper than it -- already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; so we have to shape the economy and respect the areas of economy and politics , and that we consider the re@@ united range of democr@@ atis@@ ation , otherwise we will appear in a path@@ ological monitoring hyper@@ cars that lets the movie &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; like a documentation . &quot;
&quot; so the question is not whether the capitalism has given the technical achievements that he has brought , -- &quot;
&quot; the most interesting question is whether capitalism is caused by a Dy@@ stop@@ ie , similar to the &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; or through something that the society will serve in &quot; &quot; Star Trek &quot; , &quot; in the machines to put the energy into the study of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient ath@@ mosph@@ ere &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in the long talks to the meaning of life . &quot;
I think we may be optim@@ istic .
&quot; so what could it be like it might look like this &quot; star Trek &quot; &quot; type of ut@@ opia rather than the &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; -@@ similar Dy@@ stop@@ ie ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation I would like to give you , in all brief , some examples . &quot;
&quot; in the field of companies , please ask a capital market in which you deser@@ ve money , while you are working and in which your capital is following you from a company to next , and the company -- whatever you currently works -- is the property of those who currently work in the company . &quot;
then all income comes from capital and of rede@@ em@@ ing and the concept of wage work is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the companies , but not to work in it , and employees who work there , but no de@@ gra@@ ding more between capital and labour , no large g@@ aps between investment and species , and ultimately not a empor@@ ains of Gem@@ ini @-@ apples . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy : please make sure that our national currencies would have a free flo@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which will be issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of 20 major Thres@@ hold for@@ eig@@ ners &#93; , in the interest of all of humanity . &quot;
&quot; continue to negoti@@ ated the entire world trading in this currency , we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; Kos@@ mos &quot; &quot; -- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade de@@ ficit or the trade union of the respective country into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; also imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world , in which investment . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference was proposed in 1944 .
the problem was that it was not at that time the technical means had to implement it .
&quot; today , we have it , especially in front of the background of a re@@ unification politics and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe you , is at the same time liberal , in which they found privileged persons , and mar@@ x@@ istic , because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and key@@ n@@ esi@@ an@@ ic , globally key@@ n@@ esi@@ as . &quot;
&quot; but above all others it is a world , where we can imagine a real democracy . &quot;
we will wake up in such a world
or will we put into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar Dy@@ stop@@ ie ?
the answer depends on how we pur@@ sue politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democratic .
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography themselves as liberal Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I have just said , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we do not , the technological development will produce such a massive decl@@ ine in the overall economic demand that Lar@@ ry summ@@ ers referred to as &quot; long term st@@ agn@@ ation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; due to the transfer of this crisis from a part of the earth to the next , as we &apos;re currently experiencing it , it will not only be our democr@@ acies , but also the countries , whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; just like Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a liberal Marx@@ ist , and how Key@@ nes , and therefore I am also completely wir@@ ing . &quot;
BG : actually , and now we are at ease . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ v : if you are not wir@@ ing , you do not think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a sort of philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Ein@@ stein that said . BG : in your talk , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have been very clear what you think of the point of view of the West to China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great measure of hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democr@@ acies we have the appearance of a democracy .
&quot; as I said in my talk , we have limited democracy on policy , while the area where most of the economy is going to play , -- the area of economy -- a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in certain resp@@ ite , if I may say so pro@@ voc@@ ative to say China today to the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; for -- remember -- we tend to join Liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , histor@@ ically considered . &quot;
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ al , such as John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly skep@@ tical what the democratic development concerns .
&quot; what one can now watch in China , res@@ em@@ bles very similar development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; China now is imag@@ ined to do what the West in the 19th century even has done to hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y to hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many listen@@ ers have curious about your experiences as a finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I think that it comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later to the first half @-@ year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal view , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting , because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone &quot;
&quot; not just Greece , but the euro@@ zone , &quot;
&quot; namely , to adop@@ t us from self @-@ suffici@@ ency , and di@@ gesti@@ ble den@@ ying to the euro@@ zone , and continues to grow the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity to put on the basis of the Greek fore@@ fathers -- the way , the first proposal was that these den@@ ial revealed -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro zone , within the European group , continues to den@@ ied the den@@ ial . &quot;
&quot; but you know , what is coming . &quot;
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one tries to receive an economic system that is not vi@@ able , by political will and author@@ it@@ arianism in life , one will perhaps delay some time , but when the change comes , he happens ab@@ rupt and destruc@@ tive . &quot;
BG : what changes you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you have any errors in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- seriously ...
&quot; if there is a financial minist@@ ers , or any Minister , who claims after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person . &quot;
&quot; of course , I made mistakes . &quot;
the biggest error was to sign the application for the extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the pages of money don@@ ors to find a common solution .
but that was not there .
&quot; they only wanted to fall in case our government , only because it did not want to deal with rebel@@ li@@ ers who lose around the euro@@ zone . &quot;
they did not want to enter into Greece that she has been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nom@@ inal B@@ IP .
there is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; none of the Troika &apos;s don@@ ors who has impos@@ ed us , and one : &quot; &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal@@ ary mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : in spite of all the , and despite the aggressive tones of convers@@ ations , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
25.@@ 1.@@ 2008
&quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is coming from someone who lives and lo@@ ves . &quot;
my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone is not survi@@ ved .
&quot; for when she survi@@ ved , they will be ex@@ ecu@@ red and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not be dis@@ astro@@ us for Europe , but for the entire global economy . &quot;
we are probably the most powerful economy in the world .
&quot; if we pus@@ hed ourselves to strike the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 it will appear to me , it will also be unbe@@ ar@@ able for the future of Europeans like the non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong in this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you so much that you were at TED . &quot;
Y@@ v : thank you .
&quot; by Roy Price most has never heard , although it is probably responsible for 22 medi@@ ocr@@ atic minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 . &quot;
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is silent at Amazon Studios
the TV @-@ production company of Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a cli@@ ff @-@ term and describes Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technology , ta@@ cos . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for he shows the shows and the content to watch the Amazon .
&quot; of course , this is a very hard fighting sector . &quot;
there are so many TV series that Roy did not choose any of them .
&quot; he has to find shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he needs to find shows the right on this curve . &quot;
this curve is the evaluation division of over 2500 TV series on the site IM@@ DB . the rating is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review is obtained .
&quot; if your show will be rated with nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these shows how &quot; Break@@ ing Bad &quot; , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones &quot; , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows how to cut a season , your brain ask , &quot; where is there any more of these epis@@ odes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows how &quot; Tod@@ d@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- this should be enough to tell you what happens at this end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price does not care about the left side of the curve , because I think it needs special intelligence to offer &quot; Tod@@ d@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the mean explo@@ iting , the average TV -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply delight . &quot;
&quot; so , he must make sure he really is on the right side . &quot;
&quot; the pressure is exist@@ ent , and of course it is the first time that Amazon does something that Amazon does not want to risk anything else . &quot;
he wants to create suc@@ cesses .
&quot; he needs a success , so he holds a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and select a evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and makes them online , where they can look at any charge . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon sur@@ rounds , there is still too , right ? &quot;
millions of spect@@ ators look at these epis@@ odes .
yet they do not know that they are observed in the sight of these shows .
they are observed by Roy and his team who take everything .
&quot; you record , when you start the show when you pause , which parts can be jump@@ ed or again . &quot;
&quot; collect millions of data , in order to decide with these data then what show you should produce . &quot;
&quot; in fact they collect the data , process these and resulting in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four republi@@ can U.S. transm@@ issions . &quot;
they made this show .
does someone know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many of these show can remember because it was not so good . &quot;
&quot; it is only an average sense -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7,@@ 4 amounts and Alpha House , with 7.5 -- so something about average , but not just that , what to Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; about at the same time in another company has a top manager placed a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always searching for this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a little different . &quot;
&quot; instead of a competition , he and his team gave himself the existing data about the Net@@ fli@@ x spect@@ ators , so the reviews they give the shows , whose shows them , etc . &quot;
then take advantage of these data to figure out these small details on the audience : what shows them like the producers who actors .
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they went a car and decided not to make a sit@@ com over four Sen@@ ators but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; . Net@@ fli@@ x therefore has a hit , at least for the first two s@@ ells . &quot;
house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.4 review on this curve . so exactly where they wanted .
of course the question : what happened here ?
&quot; one has two very comp@@ peti@@ tive , data versi@@ fied firms . &quot;
&quot; they connect these many data together and it works fine for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
why is this ?
because the logic has been pron@@ ounc@@ ed that this should work with everything .
&quot; if you coll@@ ects million data for a decision which you meet , then you should make a good decision . &quot;
it has 200 years of statistics as Back @-@ Up .
you are optim@@ ised it through very powerful computer .
&quot; the Min@@ de@@ ste , what you can expect , is good television , or ? &quot;
&quot; data analysis is so not working , then this is something terri@@ fying because we live in a time , in which we live more and more on statistics to meet serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
does someone know here the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; no . OK , that is even good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one comes in this room ever coming in touch with this software . come in touch with this software , you are in touch . &quot;
&quot; if someone here in the USA is in prison and for dism@@ is@@ sal , it is prob@@ able that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a release is done or not . &quot;
&quot; just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad , whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; average TV , 22 minutes , this can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
&quot; not always the best results generated . this is not because a company like multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data . &quot;
also the data versi@@ fied companies are times wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes errors . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that they can predic@@ t through data analysis of flu , the simple way , predic@@ tions -- by data analysis of Google @-@ research . &quot;
it worked wonderful and was a great news sens@@ ation . the success in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked fl@@ aw@@ less , year round year , until it was suddenly no longer working , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it simply did not work , this was once again a sens@@ ation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data versi@@ fied companies such as Amazon and Google mis@@ understand something .
&quot; despite all these errors , data in decisions of life is a -- at the workplace , in the rule of law , in medicine . &quot;
&quot; so , we should ensure that data are helpful . &quot;
&quot; also I know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ gest@@ ed gene@@ tik -- an area where some very clever people are un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions , as the decision for a cancer therapy &quot;
or the development of a medication . over the years I have seen some patterns about the difference between successful decisions on the basis of data and no successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
&quot; have you need to solve a complex problem , do mainly do two things : &quot;
&quot; when we place this problem in his items , so that you can analy@@ ze the items of the parts ; as a second place you put the items again to put an emp@@ ire . &quot;
sometimes you have to do this several times but there are always two things : apart and put together again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are just good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help create a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to res@@ etting the parts again and then come to a resolution .
there is another tool and we do it all : our brain .
&quot; if there is something that is good in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces again , even if the information is in@@ complete , so if the information is in@@ complete , especially when it is the brain &apos;s brain . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s why I think , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have data and minds , where they can also go in the process . &quot;
&quot; you use data to better understand their audience . but the decision how to put all these parts , put together again and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; , &quot; that was not in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show that meant that they entered a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon did this in the wrong way .
&quot; used data to control all their decisions , first as they chose TV @-@ ideas , then as they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as show . &quot;
it was a secure decision because they could always say : &quot; tell us the data .
it does not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data are helpful for better choices , but I believe that things do not go wrong when data will begin to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and not to forget that this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for choices . &quot;
many know it .
&quot; it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; . &quot; it is amazing . for decisions by using a ja@@ - or no question you just need to sh@@ ake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; most likely &quot; &quot; is right here at this moment . &quot;
I will later spend it later with a techn@@ icians .
I have made some decisions taken in my life where I should hear in the after@@ math on the ball .
&quot; but , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you want to replace it through a bit of expression , such as data analysis to make better choices . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; perhaps the ball , the ball , and wind@@ ing and wind@@ ing . ultimately , it is on us to make choices when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn . &quot;
&quot; and I find this as very encour@@ aging news that despite the great amount of data still paid , decisions to make , an expert in what you do , and risks . &quot;
&quot; for the end it is not the data , but the risks associated with which you end at the right end of the curve . &quot;
