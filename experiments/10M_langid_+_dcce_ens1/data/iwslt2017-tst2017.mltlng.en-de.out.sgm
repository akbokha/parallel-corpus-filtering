<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won as New York Times-Times reporter the Pulseater prize.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before someone heard by Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he were spectacular that the NSA illegal telephones heard of Americas."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter who should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence in which the CIA has been literally designs for an atomic bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">"if the crazy sounds, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter did not fall out?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">Nearly 10 years long the government is determined against cracks and calls him to call his innate sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this train he became a symbol for the pattern of the government, whistleblowers to condemn and journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First constitutional, the media have the right to publish their secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the sea, which they would like to give."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government came to cracks, he did something that many courageous reporters already did before him: he refused to go and said that he would rather go into prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"so, from 2007 to 2015 Risen lived with the risk to go in prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"then, just days before the process, has something extraordinary."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although they were longs that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped to cracks."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in time of electronic monitoring the reporter and sources can always hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"rather than to fail and cracks to the statements, they could also handle his digital footers for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the invators, without his consent, without his consent, his phone post-wise secretly,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like his e-mail data, financial and bank information, its credit card, and even irritation with the list of his flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA-whistleblowers and cracks."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many instances."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama spoke with his arrival, whistleblowers. but instead the judiciary has condemned the judiciary more than all US governments in front of him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government can get too much of their work as secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since 11 September, almost every article about national security was the result of that a whistleblowers went to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we set the press work on the game, which should be protected by the first constitutional, because the government has more and more possibilities to read all of them."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but as technology of the government allows to handle the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and while they can contact them from the moment in which they contact, rather than in the descendants, in the witness."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today, it means communication software, which has not yet been written as Risen, and it is much more secure as normal e-mails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"a such technology is SecureDrop, an open-source monitoring system for whistleblowers that was originally developed by the website of Aaron Swartz, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I work."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of send an e-mail, go to a news site, as well as the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents or send information, as with any usual contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">"these will then be encoded and stored on a server, to which only the respective news agency has access."</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government cannot coded more information, and many of the information that would demand them, would not be available from prescribed."</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect freedom of freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world are increasingly developing new espioneering technologies, which are all of us at risk."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is for us to ensure that not only technology denominator like Edward Snowden have a way to contribute to failure. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblowers,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"the above abuse at the care of soldiers complain white and of crowded hospitals, alert to the remaining water of Flint suggests. or a pilgristreet insider that warned to us before the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover the crime, but to protect our constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016 the largest data lapse of the story published.] [the "Panama Papers"] [what does this mean?] [we baten Robert Palmer of Global Witness around an explanation.] this week we have been made of messages about a bacon of 11 million documents that made in Panama</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say," okay, we need an anonymous company. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the emails, the exchange of messages as the whole system works, as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands Prime Minister has returned.</seg>
<seg id="48">"also, there are reports that a allies of the brutal Syrian dictators of Bashar al-Assad has changed into tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is asserted that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend from children's son, a famous Cellists."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people and others, which are nervous about the next release, and the next enthused documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">"now, it sounds like the plot of a agencies or a John-Grisham-Romans."</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems wept away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should us something?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and mighty are able to hide their assets in tax havens, and not all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And this affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"all over the world discuss media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens of some few things to hide and wealthy -- something that we have been discussing and behinded for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people will appear very confusing, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens function."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it as a Matrjov.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so one company has a company in another company, in another company, what it is almost impossible to understand who is behind those biilds."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters."</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably, because there were previously no prominent Americans who did in these revelations on this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">"now, it is not such that there are no rich Americans who hide their wealth in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="65">"but through the principle, according to which these tax havens function, Mossack Fonseca has become less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we would have a backup of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming, or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is so that you need to find less information in some U.S., less information, to create a company than to get a librarian reference."</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparenz in the US has allowed to disguise debt to schoolchildren.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has been fraudable to cut especially attractive investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks into practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does that work?</seg>
<seg id="73">"so, we sent a conceed warnings to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan."</seg>
<seg id="74">"our mediator gave herself as African Minister, who wanted to bring money into the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">"we really shocked it really that all up to an attorney to our inventory, how he could transoperate its money."</seg>
<seg id="76">"these were all preferences. none of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course none of anyone was handed over to anyone. however, it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as a single accidents.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not a single lawyer because of our concealed instructor proposals.</seg>
<seg id="79">"it is not about a single peak politician, wrapped in a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, through the corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to overcome this, we must change the rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to create this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">"it may sound all very foolish, as if we could do nothing against it; as if nothing had ever changed, as if there is always the rich and mighty."</seg>
<seg id="84">"but as firstborn optimist, I see that a lot of change has begun to change."</seg>
<seg id="85">Over the last few years we have seen precincts to more transparency regarding the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The issue found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU has recorded in central registers at a national level, who really behind companies in Europe and who has controlled it."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US come down here.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have brought a bill in both parties chambers, but this does not make progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how this Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, being used in the U.S. and globally for greater transparency."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">"we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind headaches."</seg>
<seg id="93">"we need executives in the economy, which stand up and say," Intransparenz is not good for business. "</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "we need leading politicians that detect the problem and to end this way through laws that this kind of intransparenz."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together, we can finish the intransparenz, which is now possible to finish this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">"this is the story, as I once was almost kidnapped and in the trunk of a red Mazda."</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day, after I had completed my design study, I made an ambassador."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda remained and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my artwork.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a roadtrip all the country. afterwards he would go to the cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him on a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" where do you know today for today? "</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing worse: "I know it not yet.</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," "Oh, man!"</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him just! he says, he would go to the peace Corps, but I don't know if he really is planning. I will not escape in the trunk of a Mazda land!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard myself: "I have a balloon. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said," "uh, like please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I was then in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought," "Oh man! what did I put in?"</seg>
<seg id="114">A wildest sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such fear that I got out of the bed, on ten pointed to the door, and my sleeping room closed."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not even crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">"the artwork, which he bought by me, depends on his classroom. he is now instructor."</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">"maybe people who were sold to me in childhood as strangers, actually friends who were just waiting to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"people on my airwaves, normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco I took the air-mate with."</seg>
<seg id="123">"do we make a break, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost plastly, my roommates draws up and the rent will increase."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can make it possible to transform fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote to my best friend and new fellow mates Brian Chesky:" Brian, I could make up something. our apartment will stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, including a mattress and every morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha!</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and established so "air conditioning and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three Happy guests were allowed to sleep at us for 20 dollars on the aviliet on woodland.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great and we also.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I am sure that our cheese ham-ham-ruquettes are completely different, because we made them for our guests."</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest and the door to the castle fell on starched Brian and I found.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and we could pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">The things came in rolls.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former fellow-roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, completed us as developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out whether you could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we presented our investors:" "we want to create a website, looking at the people publicly pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the type of rooms, whose doors are close when visiting."</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the internet they can relax and invite people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the missile would leave.</seg>
<seg id="142">Indeed they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one that is still at comfort, would invest in a shop, the foreigner allowed to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we have learned as children all that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if one has encountered a problem, you get on things that you can well. we could be designed."</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design much more is than just appearance and haptics -- it is all experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">"we learned how to be designed objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who had never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design so something?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create design trust?</seg>
<seg id="151">"I would like to give you a tasting, what degree trust we do."</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you from your comfortzone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumb high when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">"now, I would like to receive your mobile phone."</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your escape cell phone to your left sitting.</seg>
<seg id="157">"this quietly alignment of panic, which you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the first time."</seg>
<seg id="158">"for the only thing is more personal than your phone, your home is home."</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, you will see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the blocked cell phone of a foreigner in the hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So also most guests feel when they sleep elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only once so who has now Al Gores Mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you announce that he advocates the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have experienced that kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we have changed a small detail to that experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbour would have been introduced once with his name; if he would have told what he comes, like his dog or his children?"</seg>
<seg id="170">"imagine, you would have 150 assessments to all say:" he can really keep very well blocked wrinkles! "</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you would have to enter your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-conceived feedback system strengthens the trust decisive.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we still have some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to give negative assessments.</seg>
<seg id="175">Finally we decided to wait until both the host and guest had submitted their assessments before we asked them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we have discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we have conducted with Stanford a study. we investigated how probably it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are at age and residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprising we trust the people most who are at the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less confidence we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">It is a natural social occurrence.</seg>
<seg id="181">"it will be exciting, if you add a person to a person -- in our case through exassessments."</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three assessments, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but one has more than ten, changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation of similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can thus help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">"in addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much one can expect from itself."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first news of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if one tells about little such as" "Hi!" "you get rather no answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"if you tell a lot, such as:" I have problems with my mother "-- -- the request will be rather not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="190">"thus there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g." Tolle artwork in your apartment! I do with my family vacation. "</seg>
<seg id="191">How can we create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text of recommend to recommend the right amount of text. we also give tips on what topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">"our whole company builds on hope that the right design can help, our prejudices against strangers."</seg>
<seg id="194">"whereby we had not reckoned, the large amount of people who were more than willing to set these prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people are entitled to our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: unbelievable good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">"second, the tireless work of our team."</seg>
<seg id="199">"third, a need which was not covered before."</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the shop running straight very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are also times when not everything is smooth."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who are allowed to be celebrated or homes with apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I have worked in the customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood on the front front when trust has been broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing malright than this calls. I'm sorry if I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">"the disappointment that can hear in the voice of Ancaller, and will always be our greatest motivation to improve ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, of the 123 million oversized nights had only a fraction per one problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">Because people trusted each other way.</seg>
<seg id="210">When trust works, it is possible to create wonderful. "</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His hosts drove him to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his review:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travellers, which tends to cardiovascular disease."</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with enough hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real protective angels who save one life even though they do not know it right.</seg>
<seg id="218">"you drive one in your own car into the hospital, if you die, and waiting for you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they do not want you feel lonely and bring them to books.</seg>
<seg id="220">They can stay even longer without calculate the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">This is how of course not every stay.</seg>
<seg id="223">"but these relations behind pure cash-transmit are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy."</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I first came about this term stumbled, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of sharing with money-actions together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is a business trading here for an economic trading.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but it is now just to call" "rent industry", "the matter is not just."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade, human relationships. "</seg>
<seg id="229">"people place a part of itself open, and that changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="230">"if you travel nowadays, it is easy to compare with Fast Food. it is efficient and reliable, but it is less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">But what would be a rich buffet made from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if at any place you would have visited, a group there would be a thorough to fill a thorough and one in a tavern our district, of which one has never heard before;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking of a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">"nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy."</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to design apartments from the ground towards people?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities were the thought of the common share?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities which allow us society and relationships, instead of solitude and abolition."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korean capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking that belonged to the government,"</seg>
<seg id="240">"now premises were offered. students who were looking for a pencil,"</seg>
<seg id="241">Were given to people whose children were extended. there were incubatorprograms.</seg>
<seg id="242">"to finance new start-ups in the Share economy. through our platform alone, night 785 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a foreigner or even host."</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea therefore does not seem so crazy as it was brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not invented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Welcoming there was also previously.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar websites.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from happiness and timing, that one can find the right design with the components of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us to overcome prolified prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find that intriguing;</seg>
<seg id="251">Overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think every time when a red Mazda continues to pass by me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We obviously know that design can not solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if we could help us if it had such great influence, I wonder why we can use design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>

<seg id="257">A believing? a Expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, a brain-washing, a terrorist?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the safety item at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I will not give you blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">Thus the media people represent the look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">One study yielded that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>

<seg id="276">"no, not as homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear the Hijab, my headgear."</seg>
<seg id="277">"my feminist friendships were labeled:" "why do you suppress yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the spouse was: at that time it was a feminist of independence, and this compared to the pressure I felt as 17-year old, me to a perfect and unachievable beauty deal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have conclusions.</seg>

<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>

<seg id="289">"I was later, after my wedding, a child, and lived in basically the" Egyptian-American dream. "</seg>
<seg id="290">Then that horrible morning came in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I was sitting in my kitchen, had an end to finish, looked at the screen and saw the word" "rush". ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"smoke was smoke, aircraft in building, people spranate from the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My Shock is quickly turned into rebellion.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should you do something like something?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I moved the television channel, and heard:"... Muslim terrorists... "..." in the name of Islam... ",..."... "..."</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"it has not only been attacked my country but in Nu, the deeds from others turned into a suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and begin with the advancement.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember how I drove me -- as we were silent -- so deeply it went in my seat: and I was detected for the first time in a Muslim Brite.</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved this night into our apartment, in a new city, where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then I heard, looked, and read the warnings of national Islamic organizations, who possesses:" be watchful, "" Seid careful, "" lead in well illuminated areas, "" despised you not. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">"then it was Friday in that week -- the day, in which Muslims were gathered for prayer."</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again, the warnings:" do not go on this first Friday, the mosque might be a target. "</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage of the reporting.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably unfiltered and I listened to attacked by attack on Muslims or by people who were held for Muslims, in the Free officers and beat."</seg>
<seg id="311">There really gave Brandanes to mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something felt not right.</seg>
<seg id="314">"because the people who attacked this country, our country have attacked."</seg>
<seg id="315">I have been rejected the anger of people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain to himself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">They are the allegations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">"nowadays, we can actually hear people:" there is a problem in this country -- it says Muslims. "</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go out? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to combine Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It is only the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumor is considered as a whole and a benign tumor is only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are sensuous because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the USA, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, Ersthelers and Olympians. "</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America secure?</seg>
<seg id="331">"it may be released a few parking spaces, but do not stop the terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">"the regular visit of a mosque leads to view people of other faith, tolerant, and larger groups."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and like me a leader of the police in the area of Washington, DC recently told: people are actually not radicalized in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalized in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"in the radial process, one has been found that it starts online. as a first, the person believes that the person believes that the people believe the terrorists are the true Muslims and everyone who despised their behavior and ideology is a betrayal or of faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radialization, we need to keep people to go to the mosque."</seg>

<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam like the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology reasons to their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but if one casts a look at them, it does not drives them what they are blown in her" Holy Scripture. "</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>

<seg id="348">I was surprised and asked him whether they have been in touch with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said that the problem was exactly the opposite. every clergy, with whom she spoke to sweat, and told her that her anger, her sense of unrighteousness in the world, they would only bring in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that had given her anger, it was a main goal for the instrumentalization by extremists who spoke to a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam established the connection to God and its community.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of complaining for their anger, he showed their constructive way for real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what they learned in the mosque, they kept before the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">It was an insight as the Islamophobia me and my family concerns.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect anyone?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear every day on our democracy based on our thought-freedom?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually show several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear that at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept a authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudices. "</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study demonstrates: if you have reported Testers messages in which negative for Muslims was reported by military attacks on Muslim countries, as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academy problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"when you look at when the mood against Muslims under the top schoss -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the advance of the Iraqi war and during two voting.</seg>
<seg id="364">"so he is Islamophobia not simply the natural reaction to Moslem terror, as I expected it."</seg>
<seg id="365">"it can actually be a tool to manipulation the public to exploit the foundation of a free society, the rational and well informed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="366">The handling of Muslim is an early warnings.</seg>

<seg id="410">Due to consecutive aircraft high speed and acceleration on the main space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-consuming structures also.</seg>
<seg id="412">They learned how to wear loads with turbulences and generally react on natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">"our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in the autonomous flight."</seg>
<seg id="415">"making a system autonomous, it must know collectively, where in space you find the mobile properties."</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic taskks.</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos, we use a new localization technology of Verity Studios, a seedling of our laboratories."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the space which should define calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands may be at the highest levels. for example," "start" "and". ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"this is a so-called hedge,"</seg>
<seg id="422">"a aircraft, which tries to beat two flies with a flap."</seg>
<seg id="423">"as other starters, it is efficient in the warm-ward line efficient, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most of the starting fleets, it can float, and it has a large advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a downside."</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of rear-tuners is that they respond sensitive to turbulences such as wind-bows.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the aircraft no matter what position the optimal position obtained and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research we often represent basic abstract questions, which is at the heart of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be for example: what is the petty-possible number of movable parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons to answer the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand movable parts which carving to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">"for decades ago, pilots could fly remote airplane, which only had two movable parts: a propeller and a tailgate."</seg>
<seg id="435">"recently, we discovered that flying with just one works."</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the monospinner, the mechanical easiest-served aircraft. it was invented in front of shores."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only a movable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"hinges, hinges and Querruder, no further actuators or controversies, just a propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanical simpel, happens in the interior live very much so that it can fly stable and move in space to move in space."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tailgate. to bring it to flying, I have to throw it right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the probability, it is right to throw it, when I watch all, is low, therefore I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"if the monospinner is a practice in genomics, this machine is here, the Omnikopter with its eight propellers, a exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this confluence?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is still symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">"therefore, it is ambivalent in its alignment."</seg>
<seg id="446">"thus, he receives the auxiliary ability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"to move in space in all directions, no matter which direction he is filmed or even as he rotated."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the field of interactive rivers by eight propellers."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some is able in models, the rest will be learned directly at the catch."</seg>
<seg id="450">See us this.</seg>
<seg id="451">"if planes should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliably."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two-propeller planes.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns out in the clockwise direction</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise direction.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when one builds them, it behave like a high-performance square."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, something wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine as well as restricted."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate that we can make a half a half.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration studied synthetic vibrations.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression. "</seg>
<seg id="460">We took the usual micro-Quadcopter -- each individual weighs less than one disc bread -- and statues them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit white where in space it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you will motivate these demonstrations to develop new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly secure machine as it would like to put on Broadway a flying shade.</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of these technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us the reward lies in the development and the creators.</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as memory, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it permits creative to clever creatures, they are in so spectacular fashion."</seg>

<seg id="492">"all that, for I had worked, is no longer Science Fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physician in black holes and their by observatory such as LIGO measurable signals. what are gravitational waves?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitation wave is a cranes in the feeling of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when moving the wave, the space and its accumulated content is stretched in one direction and put into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">"to illustrate teachers in courses for Relativity to Relativity, often a really foolish dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dust, stretching and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on 14 September, for example, each of us was stretched out of the shafts and depleted. the stretching of an average man was 10 high 21st."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that is said 20 Nullen after the comma, followed by a 1st loan, the LIGO-employee explained for crazy."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five kilometers long laser detector, and that is already absurd, this length would have to be measured on less than a thousand light of the radius of an atomic kernels."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravitation</seg>

<seg id="503">"but physicists are inventive, and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">Scott said to LIGO. Scott said to LIGO was more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: faces, size of your mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite convenient. because so you can finish a picture or map of things by taking the coming out of several points coming light around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">In pots this is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">"heard sounds, have a wavelength of up to 15 meters."</seg>
<seg id="511">"therefore it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that make you particularly much:"</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child approximately.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead we listen to certain properties such as tape and height, rhythm and volume to close to the history behind it."</seg>

<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts it."</seg>
<seg id="516">* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to Gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">With them there are no simple pictures of objects in all.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by changing changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for LIGO the measured frequencies in the audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">If we convert shaft pattern in scarfs we can hear the all literally speak.</seg>
<seg id="522">"gravitation of the gravitation, can give us a lot about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been very long busy."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, not rotating holes, circus simply: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"turning the two bodies very fast, you can hear the same circus with an additional audio change. this sounds so on: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!"</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a kind of movement, characterized by waveform."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date, which at least I must never forget -- listening to this: [Surrendes quietness] Jemand who knows how to hear it, recognize this as a device of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-facher parasol that turn around as quickly as the sticks of your mixers."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: we think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the gest body in all, one with a mass of 29 sonnen, the other with a mass of 36 Sonnen, surrounds one hundred times per second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">20.08.2015</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the Permanent meaning of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO was a completely new path to exploring the universe as they never had previously been possible.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to all and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all we can see -- practically or basically -- not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a Supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars in Supernovae explode."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. of them we learned much about space.</seg>
<seg id="538">"but the exciting physical events occur in the core, which is behind thousand kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon hidden."</seg>
<seg id="539">"we will never go through, as these opak are."</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational-waves penetrate iron, as if it would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we would never see her the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them as the Urgall is covered by its own offspring."</seg>
<seg id="541">The help of gravitational shafts should be possible to relook back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">"and that is most important: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen we have never seen, and of which we have no idea. things we only discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, LIGO found right in the first sight of things that we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this topic: me: the type of stars, the black holes, such as LIGO they observed, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">They are tremendous, ancient body from prehistoric times. the black holes are to speak for our archaeological work. "</seg>

<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, on my children, on our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">"but it also has an amazing side-effect: first, I was actually completely understood that the" "Yes" "for playing with my children my career saved."</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>

<seg id="581">"Hi,"</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream-Multimedia</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I do television in a great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">"in this TV season I am responsible for it, 70 hours of program to go into the world."</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">"each show provides hundreds of jobs, which did not exist."</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for a episode of a television program can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Say we five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"new episode all nine days of four shows, so all nine days 20 million dollars, four TV programs, four hours TV, three Shows, while at the same time: 24 episodes: grey's, 21 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours of television"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV serien walk at each other on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world run my series in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators.</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours, shipments I create, and not only produced, so still obendlessly. I must find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans in stock and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four Television, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 millions of dollars, bonfire that burn around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who that still does?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no, of this reason I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream-Multimedia</seg>
<seg id="600">I would not like to print them with this.</seg>
<seg id="601">"I say it, because I know what you think when the word" author. ""</seg>
<seg id="602">"I say it to you so that all of you who work so hard if you are now a company, a country or a classroom to take me seriously when I am talking about work, so that I say not only at the computer, and it is true if I say, I understand that it does not work with a dream job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it is all a job, all work, all reality, all the blood, all sweat -- not tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">I work much, hard and I love it. "</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I am deepened into the work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country from nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is, as I set troops on, when malte I put on a canvas."</seg>
<seg id="608">"as dreams, there is a high tone, like a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work it.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanical, strenuous and berrally, funny and disturbing, clinically and motherly, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing is the sums."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when working well runs.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a sums starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the sums listen to as a lively street, I could always go on her."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people take to them, when I talk to them the sums that I am writing, that the writing was made me joy."</seg>
<seg id="616">"do not understand me wrong, what does it do."</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the sums -- when I started working with the TV production, when I began to work and to work and to build, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy. the sums!"</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums is the voice of God in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a sums, then you cannot strive any other than according to size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"feel, not different to strive than to strive, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is what we call the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means a workaholic to be.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Maybe it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I know it not.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I know only that I am not for failure, and I know only that I love the soup."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I just want to say to you, I am a Titan, and I know that I will not ask it into question."</seg>
<seg id="632">"in order to make a clear thing: the more successful I will, the more broadcasts, the more overthrows, the more work there, the more things at the same time, the more things get my story, the more my expectations, so much more expectations there is."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work, to be successful, the more it needs to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what do I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work but not true?</seg>
<seg id="636">"the land, which I scaffe, the marathon, which I lower, the army, the high tone, the sums, the sums."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this swamp. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I needed the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then stops the sums.</seg>
<seg id="641">"revised, supervised, burned."</seg>
<seg id="642">The admmen stops.</seg>
<seg id="643">"now, my three daughters are used to the truth, that their mum is a single work of work."</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mom will not be there, but you can write my nianny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"Emerson says:" "sheep, I want to go to Shonda land."</seg>
<seg id="646">There are the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are Baby-Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1, when the adsilly heard."</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine stubbled.</seg>
<seg id="650">I did not love my work anymore. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums came not back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"made the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, crossed Weekend, no remorse, nothing delegates, a Titan sleeps, does not cover, with full heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a preview of Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do if what you do, the work that you love, suddenly faded?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know, some may think:" "Heul thee, blöder author-Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know it, you do what you do is, you love to be a teacher, a painter, Bill Gates, and knows how to stops the sums when the sums stops, who is then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"if the song of my heart listens, I can survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states waitress" a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way to outside, late dran and she says:" Mama, magst you play? "</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say No to me than two things are aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I must say yes to all and secondly, she called me not."</seg>
<seg id="675">It is not called any more "sword."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happened?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I miss it when I am Titan bin and my soup, and here everything changes from my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," "Mama, magst you play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," yes. "</seg>
<seg id="680">It is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and their sisters we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding, because my pain and my panic, in the loneliness and the absence of summing, I can do nothing except."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the land, which I scaffe, the marathon, which I lower, the army, the high tone - they do not exist anymore."</seg>
<seg id="687">"everything that exists are sticky finger and damp kisses, delicate voices, guarded voices, guarded and the song in which it goes wrong, or whatever the girl in" "the ice." ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so barely that I can barely breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can barely believe that I breathed.</seg>
<seg id="691">Play is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me solves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energy-attack is coming.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and this is not immediately, but it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums comes slowly back.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it is silent, hardly heard, but it is there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the adsilly, but a sums."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as I would like to know a magic secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let us remain with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. this is all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something that we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums, the male summers, the Titanic summen, which is just the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I am complaint with the help of broadcasts and TV hours, and how do I get my brain, then I have forgotten what the real sums is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The summing is not strength and it is not too specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent upon the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The true sums is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums is the stream that comes from life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The true summing is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"the real sums ignores the pressure of the story, which lead to done tasks, the expectation and the pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real sums is the voice in my ear, but perhaps whispered me God the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan am?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a bit more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"as soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this for a fixed rule that I can deliver me as a workaholic from any fault.</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no choice. I have no choice when I want to hear the swamp again."</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so simple. I am not good in playing, I like it. "</seg>
<seg id="721">"do not play anything like working, like working."</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth does hurts;</seg>
<seg id="723">But I like it not to play.</seg>
<seg id="724">"I am always working, because I love it."</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at the workplace as home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this race confession is painful, because what a human being works better than to be home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"yes, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honest, I call myself" "Titan" ""</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>

<seg id="731">"we rasen in the garden around, before and back, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we make small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play Ball.</seg>

<seg id="736">I will always go to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is OK.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my kids show me how to live, and the sums of the universe filled me."</seg>
<seg id="739">"I play and play, until I ask myself: why did we have heard the games ever?"</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also! tell us yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe hold me for naïve for a daydreams.</seg>
<seg id="742">"you may well right, but you can do it!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet-show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little wish to play at most 15 minutes with me until they fails to make them something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">"there are wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes I have replaced a puppet or cookie.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and speak my teenagers, whole 15 minutes long with me, I am the mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"there are only 15 minutes, more needs it not."</seg>
<seg id="752">"everybody can bring about 15 minutes on the piece, even on a bad mood."</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no cell, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner that make children ready.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are drin!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my well-being, my world. there must not be the children. it is to feel the sums to have a place for his soul."</seg>
<seg id="758">It does not go for playing with your own children. it is about joy.</seg>
<seg id="759">Around the "Play" in general.</seg>

<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>

<seg id="765">15 minutes in the piece why not full 15 minutes away?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can it be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my spare time. the sums seems to return if I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without play.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months, a door opens up a door, and I find myself in my office. I hear a unknown melody, it filled me and my soul. I listen to new ideas. I can seize it in full brewing and love my work again."</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums but I love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I do not need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the sums of the sums is not me... no more.</seg>

<seg id="795">_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgical.</seg>
<seg id="797">As most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how to change your life from one second to the other, after a heavy stroke, or after a car."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other bodily organs, has a very low capacity to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a serious violation of the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, heavy disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I was functional neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by different surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"they have heard them from one of the most prominent, the" deep-irmulation "." they implanted an electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function improves. "</seg>
<seg id="805">It truly is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson who suffered severe pain in tremendous trembling and heavy soreness.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation however does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the recovery of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to you.</seg>
<seg id="810">With a little help you can help the brain itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was conductive Oberärztin and worked day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I found patients with Schädel-Hirn-Trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that at Schädel-Hirn-Traumata die brain and the skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life it is necessary to minate the skull-pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">This is sometimes necessary to remove a part of swollen cheek.</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead, instead throw away, we decided to analyze with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist to analyze the brain."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"cells from a conscientity grow, is comparable with very small children who will be taken from your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you must find the correct nutrition, temperature, moisture and the environments to cut them."</seg>
<seg id="823">That's what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many contaminated it Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw it under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked like a regular cell culture. with large green cells that are surrounded by small, unmature cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from the biologist that stem cells are unmature cells that can transform themselves into any cell type of organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has trim cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, little niche of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this kind of tribal cells from the surface tissue of the brain's mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made an additional fascinating observation: normal trim cells are very active -- they share very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells remained different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They split slowly and after a couple of weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cellular population that looked like trim cells, but in different."</seg>
<seg id="837">"we needed for a long time to understand, where they came."</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells hot Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">You will make 4% of our large-hirs basins.</seg>
<seg id="842">You play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the foetus they ensure the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they remain us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they take part in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations near brainjuries."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so certain.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our regulators.</seg>
<seg id="849">"we stand before a potential cell source, which allows brains."</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">"so, we decided to develop an experiment."</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain from the non-linguistic area and then the cells differ exactly as cultured as it did Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="853">And they are then colourful to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we implant it on the drafting of the same.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologian transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we are expecting these cells in normative brain tissue? and what will happen if we cross the same cells in your business tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we decessed the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that they had been completely taken after a few weeks when they were back home. the room is already occupied, they will not be used there, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added a violation of and investigated exactly the same cells and now remained the cells -- they want to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you can see what we could watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have resorted.</seg>
<seg id="862">"proof that they show are these small points. these are the cells, which we are in vitro, in the culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">"here, we were not able to stop."</seg>
<seg id="864">"do these cells also help a monkey, yourself from a shepherd hurtness to recover?"</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual version task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feed-pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">This made them very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they reached a solid skill level, we owe it to the motoric Cortex the handmotorik area."</seg>
<seg id="869">"then the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move her hand."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen with people, they recover spontaneously up to some degree, just like after one stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"the patients are paralyzed, and then try to relax with the help of plastical brain mechanics. you can recover yourself at some degree, just as the monkey."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were sure that the monkey had achieved its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">"on the left side they see the monkeys, which spontaneously recover."</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original performance against injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so accurate and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now you see, when we did the cells implanted: the same monkey, two months after the implantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting outcomes.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since this time we have found much more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can take them freezing and later use.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models using Parkinson.</seg>
<seg id="881">"but our dream is still getting to implant them with man."</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon as we give human brain the means to heal themselves.</seg>
<seg id="883">"thanks,"</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I am sure that now, several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think:" I know someone who need this. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question of what the biggest obstacles are, before you can start clinical studies at the people."</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to fill out about two kilograms and forms of forms to go through this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delikous etc. "</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it needs a long time, a lot of patience and a nearly professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get the permission to start of clinical trials. if you go further into the future, how many years will take it until someone can come into hospital and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: this is difficult to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">Initially it depends on the approval of clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us to start the authority soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then it is necessary to perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it has been a long time to select patients, the treatments perform and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply it on a multi-centric study.</seg>
<seg id="897">"one must first prove that it is useful, before you can offer this treatment every one."</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is sure of course. JB: natural.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne: thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it.</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West do a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that is in reality, but as the inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as unchangeable circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great offspring in Beijing have doubts about that it is possible to have a blooming capitalism and impressive growth while the politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">"indeed, democracy in us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made clear to me as a financial crisis in Eurogroup, our elections -- not the austerity policies may not affect the austerity that were realized in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"in this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my sincerous friends that would be repeated, if it would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce an economic model to a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a mistake, we could not save democracy, but that we need a true and defending democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"for without democracy our societies are committed to our future, our future, and our great, new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of wastage, I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction, who currently threatens our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">I burn it to the "Zwillingsgipfel-Paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"one summit is known to you. you know and recognize it as the Schuldenberg, who raises his long shadow over the US, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognise the Schuldenberg</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few recognise his fake.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which belongs to anist austerity and corporations, however, who could hold there, where it would be productive and income to produce, with which you need to produce the Schuldenberg and also all the things that humanity urgent need for example, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"in the past 3 months were invested in the USA, in England and in the eurozone 3,4 Billions US dollars, such as industrial buildings, schools, roads, track, equipment and so on and so forth."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3,4 Billions US dollar sounds after a lot of money, until one with the 5,1 Billions US dollar holders that at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did, except the borrocities and the real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus, debts and unproductive capital is the Twins apples which are not sufficient through the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result are stagable wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54 yearling in the US, Japan and Europe unemployed, which might not invest in a final demand in which they would not invest. just like Ödipus Father, who is out of fear, the prophecy of the Iraqi may be true that his son would kill him if he will grow,"</seg>
<seg id="925">Unstripped the circumstances that lead to that Ödipus kill him kills.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hadern with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"its superficial Article All the unproductive capital should be used to develop our lives, human talents and especially to finance the technologies of" green "technologies that are decisive for saving the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">Thus democracy is the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think. but before we continue: what do we understand by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the social form of control in the outdoors and the poor as a majority of government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy naturally closed too many of --</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, there would be a mistake, the importance of athetic democracy based on these outputs."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decision on the Athenian democracy was and is that they were working in the working of the arms, but not only the right to freedom of expression, but important and crucial that they have the right to political participation of equal rights in issues of heads."</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy does not have kept a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, which is very bright lights, it is also quickly burned."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our present liberal democracies have not their roots in ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the athic democracy focused on the free citizens, and the working group's poor forces, based on our liberal democracy based on the values of Magna Carta, which was ultimately a statute for ruling class."</seg>
<seg id="940">"for the liberal democracy only came to, as a complete separation of politics and economy and the democratic process was introduced to politics, while the economy - thus the world of corporations -- a democratic free zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our present democracies has been taking place since the time, in which this separation of politics and economy began to mighate the immunity between the two by taking the economy gradually approaching politics, and it escaped them."</seg>
<seg id="942">Wonder why politicians are no longer like earlier?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not on a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is that one cannot be in the government nowadays, and still not in power, because the power of politics is picked up into the economy and the areas are separate."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hadern with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is like a herd of robbery that have so sustained the animals, of which they are nourished, declined that it is thus hungry."</seg>
<seg id="947">"similarly, it is similar to the economy that politicians are so far from the self-condemned crisis itself. the power of the corporations is growing, political freightness increases, the overall demand falls and the managing directors of the corporations are to be imprisoned to safeguard the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful of capitalism the" "Demos" "the people] out of democracy, the higher the Gemma summit, and the greater the dising of human labour power and the prosperity of humankind."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if that is wrong, it is obvious that we have to bring the politics and the economy back, and it would be better if the" "demos" "control, as in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left this idea had already been 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The teaching from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working group is poor only by a marvel of a position as in ancient Athens without creating new species of brutality and wastage.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: to create the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by drawing Niedrigworthwhile replaced by Automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, so long business and politics are separate areas, the automation summit will be higher, the wastage dump, and the social conflicts deeper than it -- already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we have to shape the economy and respect the areas of economy and politics, and that we consider the reunited range of democratisation, otherwise we will appear in a pathological monitoring hypercars that lets the movie" "Matrix" "like a documentation."</seg>
<seg id="957">"so the question is not whether the capitalism has given the technical achievements that he has brought, --"</seg>
<seg id="958">"the most interesting question is whether capitalism is caused by a Dystopie, similar to the" "matrix" "or through something that the society will serve in" "Star Trek", "in the machines to put the energy into the study of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient athmosphere" Agora, "in the long talks to the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"so what could it be like it might look like this" star Trek "" type of utopia rather than the "" matrix "" -similar Dystopie? "</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation I would like to give you, in all brief, some examples."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the field of companies, please ask a capital market in which you deserve money, while you are working and in which your capital is following you from a company to next, and the company -- whatever you currently works -- is the property of those who currently work in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income comes from capital and of redeeming and the concept of wage work is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the companies, but not to work in it, and employees who work there, but no degrading more between capital and labour, no large gaps between investment and species, and ultimately not a emporains of Gemini-apples."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy: please make sure that our national currencies would have a free floating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which will be issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of 20 major Threshold foreigners], in the interest of all of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"continue to negotiated the entire world trading in this currency, we call it" the cosmos, "in units of" Kosmos "" -- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade union of the respective country into a common fund. "</seg>
<seg id="967">"also imagine that this fund is investing in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world, in which investment."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes in the Bretton Woods Conference was proposed in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that it was not at that time the technical means had to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have it, especially in front of the background of a reunification politics and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world I describe you, is at the same time liberal, in which they found privileged persons, and marxistic, because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the dustbin of history, and keynesianic, globally keynesias."</seg>
<seg id="973">"but above all others it is a world, where we can imagine a real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="974">We will wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we put into a "matrix" - similar Dystopie?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we pursue politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography themselves as liberal Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I have just said, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... Do we do not, the technological development will produce such a massive decline in the overall economic demand that Larry summers referred to as" long term stagnation "." "</seg>
<seg id="984">"due to the transfer of this crisis from a part of the earth to the next, as we're currently experiencing it, it will not only be our democracies, but also the countries, whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"just like Hayek, that's why I am a liberal Marxist, and how Keynes, and therefore I am also completely wiring."</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are at ease. "</seg>
<seg id="988">"Yv: if you are not wiring, you do not think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a sort of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein that said. BG: in your talk, you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have been very clear what you think of the point of view of the West to China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my talk, we have limited democracy on policy, while the area where most of the economy is going to play, -- the area of economy -- a completely democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in certain respite, if I may say so provocative to say China today to the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"for -- remember -- we tend to join Liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake, historically considered."</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberal, such as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly skeptical what the democratic development concerns.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what one can now watch in China, resembles very similar development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"China now is imagined to do what the West in the 19th century even has done to hypocrisy to hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners have curious about your experiences as a finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I think that it comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later to the first half-year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from personal view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not just Greece, but the eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely, to adopt us from self-sufficiency, and digestible denying to the eurozone, and continues to grow the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity to put on the basis of the Greek forefathers -- the way, the first proposal was that these denial revealed --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately, the powers within the euro zone, within the European group, continues to denied the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">"but you know, what is coming."</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if one tries to receive an economic system that is not viable, by political will and authoritarianism in life, one will perhaps delay some time, but when the change comes, he happens abrupt and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you have any errors in your time as a finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- seriously...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a financial ministers, or any Minister, who claims after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, he made no mistake, then this is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">"of course, I made mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest error was to sign the application for the extension of the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest in the pages of money donors to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not there.</seg>
<seg id="1022">"they only wanted to fall in case our government, only because it did not want to deal with rebelliers who lose around the eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to enter into Greece that she has been a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal BIP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">There is worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">"none of the Troika's donors who has imposed us, and one:" "that was a colossalary mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1027">"BG: in spite of all the, and despite the aggressive tones of conversations, you seem to be quite pro-European."</seg>
<seg id="1028">25.1.2008</seg>
<seg id="1029">"my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves."</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the eurozone is not survived.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"for when she survived, they will be execured and destroy the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1032">"this will not be disastrous for Europe, but for the entire global economy."</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the most powerful economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">"if we pushed ourselves to strike the way of a post-modern 1930 it will appear to me, it will also be unbearable for the future of Europeans like the non-Europeans."</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you are wrong in this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">"Yanis, thank you so much that you were at TED."</seg>
<seg id="1037">Yv: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">"by Roy Price most has never heard, although it is probably responsible for 22 mediocratic minutes of your life on 19 April 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is silent at Amazon Studios</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production company of Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has a cliff-term and describes Twitter as" movies, TV, technology, tacos. "</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for he shows the shows and the content to watch the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard fighting sector."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy did not choose any of them.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he has to find shows, which are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he needs to find shows the right on this curve."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation division of over 2500 TV series on the site IMDB. the rating is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review is obtained.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"if your show will be rated with nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these shows how" Breaking Bad "," "Game of Thrones", "" The Wire "-- all the shows how to cut a season, your brain ask," where is there any more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left side, here at this end, shows how" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- -- this should be enough to tell you what happens at this end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price does not care about the left side of the curve, because I think it needs special intelligence to offer" Toddlers and Tiaras. ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts about the mean exploiting, the average TV -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply delight."</seg>
<seg id="1057">"so, he must make sure he really is on the right side."</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is existent, and of course it is the first time that Amazon does something that Amazon does not want to risk anything else."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs a success, so he holds a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and select a evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and makes them online, where they can look at any charge."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon surrounds, there is still too, right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators look at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">Yet they do not know that they are observed in the sight of these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team who take everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you record, when you start the show when you pause, which parts can be jumped or again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">"collect millions of data, in order to decide with these data then what show you should produce."</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact they collect the data, process these and resulting in the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a sitcom over four republican U.S. transmissions. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does someone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many of these show can remember because it was not so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is only an average sense -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7,4 amounts and Alpha House, with 7.5 -- so something about average, but not just that, what to Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"about at the same time in another company has a top manager placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always searching for this a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a little different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of a competition, he and his team gave himself the existing data about the Netflix spectators, so the reviews they give the shows, whose shows them, etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then take advantage of these data to figure out these small details on the audience: what shows them like the producers who actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they went a car and decided not to make a sitcom over four Senators but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards ". Netflix therefore has a hit, at least for the first two sells."</seg>
<seg id="1079">House of Cards "gets a 9.4 review on this curve. so exactly where they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">"one has two very comppetitive, data versified firms."</seg>
<seg id="1082">"they connect these many data together and it works fine for one of them, but not for the other company."</seg>
<seg id="1083">Why is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because the logic has been pronounced that this should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collects million data for a decision which you meet, then you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years of statistics as Back-Up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You are optimised it through very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the Mindeste, what you can expect, is good television, or?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"data analysis is so not working, then this is something terrifying because we live in a time, in which we live more and more on statistics to meet serious decisions, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does someone know here the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"no. OK, that is even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">"multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one comes in this room ever coming in touch with this software. come in touch with this software, you are in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone here in the USA is in prison and for dismissal, it is probable that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a release is done or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad, whether a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"average TV, 22 minutes, this can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">"not always the best results generated. this is not because a company like multi-health system does not know how to use data."</seg>
<seg id="1098">Also the data versified companies are times wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes errors."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that they can predict through data analysis of flu, the simple way, predictions -- by data analysis of Google-research."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderful and was a great news sensation. the success in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked flawless, year round year, until it was suddenly no longer working,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply did not work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine" Nature. "</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data versified companies such as Amazon and Google misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all these errors, data in decisions of life is a -- at the workplace, in the rule of law, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">"so, we should ensure that data are helpful."</seg>
<seg id="1108">"also I know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-gested genetik -- an area where some very clever people are unimaginable many data to make serious decisions, as the decision for a cancer therapy"</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medication. over the years I have seen some patterns about the difference between successful decisions on the basis of data and no successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"have you need to solve a complex problem, do mainly do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"when we place this problem in his items, so that you can analyze the items of the parts; as a second place you put the items again to put an empire."</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times but there are always two things: apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are just good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help create a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to resetting the parts again and then come to a resolution.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we do it all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something that is good in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces again, even if the information is incomplete, so if the information is incomplete, especially when it is the brain's brain."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"that's why I think, Netflix was so successful because they have data and minds, where they can also go in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"you use data to better understand their audience. but the decision how to put all these parts, put together again and make it a show like" House of Cards "," that was not in the data. "</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show that meant that they entered a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"used data to control all their decisions, first as they chose TV-ideas, then as they chose" Alpha House "as show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a secure decision because they could always say: "tell us the data.</seg>
<seg id="1124">It does not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data are helpful for better choices, but I believe that things do not go wrong when data will begin to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and not to forget that this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for choices."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"it is also called" Magic 8 Ball "." it is amazing. for decisions by using a ja- or no question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer. "" most likely "" is right here at this moment. "</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will later spend it later with a technicians.</seg>
<seg id="1132">I have made some decisions taken in my life where I should hear in the aftermath on the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you want to replace it through a bit of expression, such as data analysis to make better choices."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"perhaps the ball, the ball, and winding and winding. ultimately, it is on us to make choices when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I find this as very encouraging news that despite the great amount of data still paid, decisions to make, an expert in what you do, and risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"for the end it is not the data, but the risks associated with which you end at the right end of the curve."</seg>
