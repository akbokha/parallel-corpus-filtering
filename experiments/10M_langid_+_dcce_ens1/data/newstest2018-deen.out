Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps showing your view to the city
&quot; an Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt , where we are to meet young people today . &quot;
a Gru@@ ber kap@@ elle is now called for S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small garden@@ ers econom@@ ies the lon@@ esome reason of peas@@ ant farmers .
the oldest official map coin promotes exciting stories to days .
Sch@@ and@@ VT if maps are not currently up @-@ to @-@ date .
&quot; this knows everyone who had to rain , because the car @-@ Nav@@ i took place a green me@@ adow . &quot;
&quot; the historical map of the digital Bavaria At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bayern of the State Government , everything else is up to date - but especially very enlight@@ ened . &quot;
especially if one has compar@@ es them with current online maps .
&quot; then , as well as cities and municip@@ alities in the spread @-@ area of the Mün@@ chner Merk@@ ur since the 19th century have changed . &quot;
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a Flick@@ r@@ epp@@ i that one can not realis@@ e as such .
&quot; the large over@@ sight@@ ings have been implemented for cities and municip@@ alities of more detailed maps , so @-@ called ur@@ posi@@ tions@@ als . &quot;
this result@@ ed in accordance with the indications of the Bayer@@ ische Ver@@ di@@ version management between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and jump of the first sur@@ vey@@ ing Bay@@ ern@@ s .
your client : Napoleon
the French army @-@ leaders of Bavaria since the spring 1800 during the Second World War Agreement with Austria .
Napoleon gave an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic recording of Bay@@ ern@@ s on behalf of course - naturally for military purposes .
&quot; even if the French troops moved with the peace of LU@@ N@@ É@@ VILLE from 9 February 18@@ 01 , there were the contemporary neighb@@ ors who created the idea of a wide @-@ area of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Kur@@ für@@ st@@ allion Max I@@ V. Joseph tri@@ eb the project continued , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bayer@@ ische Ver@@ di@@ ment administration . &quot;
the Ur@@ posi@@ tional Museum of Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is like to find all others on the website of the Bayer@@ ischen Land@@ olom@@ bli@@ othek .
the comparison of Early / Today is the example of the provin@@ cial capital at the most impressive .
the city has been expanded in all directions and has grown up .
one example of this is sub@@ send@@ ling that appears in the map of 18@@ 56 yet relatively isolated .
&quot; Send@@ ling was founded in 21 years after the map of the map , so 1877 , as the Munich part of the city . &quot;
today is lower in the middle of the city .
&quot; the houses are focusing around 18@@ 56 along the current Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ strasse , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the insur@@ rection of the Bav@@ arian peasants against Austria 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today is the west @-@ park , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : when it appears a small @-@ piece card with do@@ z@@ ens lines and numbers : hand number@@ ed Fl@@ ur@@ pieces from the so called &quot; &quot; Ur@@ der &quot; , &quot; which was derived from the &quot; &quot; primitive &quot; . &quot; &quot;
small plots there is no farmers there today - but small garden@@ er of the plant in the sun today .
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
&quot; the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wiese since 18@@ 10 spect@@ acle of the Ok@@ tober@@ f@@ ests , was in the 19th century still a me@@ adow - and no concrete . &quot;
on the other side of the Is@@ ar gives the historical map an insight into the history of the psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; in the course of the present district of A@@ u @-@ Ha@@ id@@ hausen , not only reads the stre@@ et@@ name &quot; &quot; at the Gast@@ eig &quot; or from the ascent &quot; On the ventilation &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße , one used to be with mad@@ ness . &quot;
there was 18@@ 58 / 59 the Mün@@ chner circle @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anst@@ alt &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ders .
&quot; since 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den the institution - that psychiat@@ r@@ ist that is brought into connection with the death of King Ludwig &apos;s death . &quot;
&quot; he was pro@@ gressi@@ vely for his time , and ended for example the an@@ kl@@ ets of so called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; moreover , he is forbidden to use the personnel , violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museum Ha@@ id@@ hausen , who has engaged in an exhibition with the An@@ st@@ alt . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients there was first place , later was expanded to 500 places . &quot;
&quot; some@@ time , this capacity is no longer derived from - the reason for the construction of the rotor blades age in hair 1905 . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ East , one of the biggest Psychiat@@ ri@@ gs of Germany . &quot;
at the A@@ real the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ old now meet young people in the Mün@@ chner Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the med@@ als re@@ war@@ n of the buildings in 1920 and walked in a youth @-@ group with training .
&quot; west is the football ground of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residence from the 1980@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 one set the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bosco &quot; &quot; - in architec@@ tures to the origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ acy , which was destroyed during World War II . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was founded in 18@@ 56 as &quot; &quot; main square &quot; , &quot; the merch@@ ant name was called &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a crucial change brought the Second World War in the heart of Munich .
the bom@@ bs of the Al@@ lies between December 1944 many holes in the city center .
a big left until today - on Mari@@ enhof .
&quot; the English institute , small business buildings and a pit @-@ kap@@ elle from the Middle Ages once stood by Mari@@ enhof , where these days were to work and take place on 5 April 2017 the cle@@ f track for the second S @-@ Bahn track . &quot;
&quot; with the slider , the old Munich map can be compared to the air @-@ picture of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof . &quot;
civil rights @-@ group published di@@ lution for Miss@@ ouri
the National Association for the promotion of colored people exhi@@ bit a warning for colored people who trav@@ elled due to the discrimination policy and the rac@@ ist attacks of the State to Miss@@ ouri .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the federal state of Miss@@ ouri , which aims to enter into force on 28 August 2017 , as a number of frag@@ ile , r@@ acial @-@ based approach in recent times throughout the country and will notice that it is stated in the opinion of the group . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law of Miss@@ ouri , which makes people harder to gain discrimination , as well as the Prosec@@ ution authorities of the state , the disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ately on minorities , for@@ war@@ n the group , the for@@ war@@ nings , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
they have viol@@ ations of the civil rights that people will happen .
&quot; they are halt@@ ed because of its skin colour , they will put together or killed , &quot; &quot; said the President of Miss@@ ouri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
&quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency , which we have not yet heard . &quot;
it is the first such warning that has issued the organisation for a state in the USA .
&quot; the group aimed at the University of Miss@@ ouri against black students at the University of Miss@@ ouri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died at the beginning of the year , after spending over the journey through the state had no more pet@@ rol more and taken by the police of Miss@@ ouri in cust@@ ody , without any crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also indicates a recently published report of the office of the general rule from Miss@@ ouri , in which it is shown that black drivers will become more common in the state of 75 percent more frequently than women . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and their families , friends and staff will inform about what might happen in Miss@@ ouri , &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
&quot; people need to be ready whether it can bring , or to know the relatives that they travel through the state . &quot;
&quot; Miss@@ ouri result@@ ed in 2015 100 H@@ ass@@ verb@@ ally , according to the latest figures from the H@@ ass@@ verb@@ s @-@ report program of the F@@ BI , who set the state in terms of the number of such viol@@ ations on the 16th rank of the country . &quot;
&quot; the for@@ war@@ ming is also an answer to a new Miss@@ ouri law , which would make it harder to compla@@ in a company because of housing or employment discrimination . &quot;
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union had published for Texas and Arizona , which passed the United States of imm@@ ig@@ rants to simpli@@ fy people due to the imm@@ igration existence , which will contribute to the opinion of the AC@@ LU for further tra@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; travel events are usually issued by the Foreign Ministry for other countries , but at last time stak@@ eholders the measure as a reaction to certain laws and trends in the United States . &quot;
Wei@@ de@@ za@@ un@@ project is el@@ ementary
the Fisch@@ erb@@ acher Wei@@ de@@ z@@ au@@ n project is a success project and is continued during the next year .
the CD@@ U @-@ Bun@@ dest@@ ag@@ sab@@ s Peter White and Kor@@ dula K@@ ovac have created a picture on site .
&quot; at the rect@@ angle of the family Sch@@ wen@@ dem@@ ann met representatives of the Fisch@@ erb@@ acher CD@@ U , together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two M@@ EP@@ s . &quot;
&quot; Markus Sch@@ wen@@ dem@@ ann grant first insights into his company , in which he was 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest c@@ rop@@ s , 40 kil@@ u@@ alties and also houses in five apartments of Feri@@ eng@@ ths . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Schwar@@ zwal@@ d@@ mil@@ ch &quot; &quot; is for him the ag@@ itation mark@@ eter for the milk of his cows , so swi@@ vel dem@@ ann . &quot;
at the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ths comes exclusively regional .
&quot; as he is also an BL@@ HV leader of Fisch@@ bach , he was important the Wei@@ de@@ za@@ un@@ project as &quot; el@@ ementary . &quot; &quot;
I can not be sm@@ atter@@ ed surfaces on such a ste@@ ep surfaces .
&quot; green surface care for a lot of work , a lot of nuts will be processed with the motor racing . &quot;
&quot; we have to fight with the conditions and with top@@ ography , &quot; st@@ ressed Sch@@ wen@@ dem@@ ann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 he adopted the el@@ ter@@ ly operation and enter@@ tains this without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zers , even if he does not lead a bi@@ ob@@ ab@@ ras@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognized the importance of the ordination . &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hect@@ are would have to be supported .
&quot; one hope that the sc@@ ents of the areas could be gone out for a while . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the biggest treasure , we have the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how to continue their operations , &quot; st@@ ressed the Mayor . &quot;
the farmers stand for the promotion of often in criticism
there were a total of 25 plots of eleven participants in 2013 .
the dis@@ closure area is 40 hectares which can not be re@@ for@@ ged by at least 2023 .
&quot; from the total costs of 71 500 Euro the half of 71 € was promot@@ ed about leader , a quarter tru@@ sted by the municipality of Fisch@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; consequently , the farmers had to invest in 16,@@ 2 kilometres Wei@@ de@@ z@@ au@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Sch@@ wen@@ dem@@ ann . &quot;
&quot; Kor@@ dula K@@ ovac bet@@ onte : &quot; &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and land@@ lady . &quot;
&quot; also available for Peter White , &quot; &quot; here are the best food produced . &quot;
the land@@ scap@@ ing line ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state promotion of femin@@ ized .
the goal is the dis@@ closure of the flock .
prerequis@@ ite is the presence of one of the L@@ PR was back@@ drop .
&quot; in addition , the in@@ en@@ closed area is not allowed to det@@ eri@@ or ( Hang@@ ar level by 35 percent ) and therefore must be threatened by the for@@ est@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; for the Fisch@@ erb@@ acher Wei@@ de@@ za@@ un@@ project 2018 , the application will currently run by eight participants with 24 plots that would like to build nearly 16 kilometers of Zau@@ n . &quot;
the dis@@ closure area corresponds 35 hectares which are calculated with more than 112 000 Euro .
is nothing more holy ?
&quot; now , the white house of Tru@@ mp is taking the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
the saf@@ est character of a regime loss is it when they begin to att@@ ack@@ down the stat@@ ues .
the Americans really value these equally like any other - hence the carefully ins@@ ulated Stur@@ z S@@ add@@ am H@@ uss@@ el in Bag@@ hd@@ ad in Bag@@ hd@@ ad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key @-@ ide@@ ologists of Tru@@ mp @-@ regi@@ mes , certainly did what he did , when he was a symbo@@ lic A@@ xt in a h@@ itz@@ ky disp@@ ute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N on the proposals of the President to the dr@@ astic restric@@ tion of the leg@@ ged imm@@ igration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to remain fair , Miller is not the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of Boot@@ s@@ b@@ itz@@ ers and Liberty @-@ im@@ ators had made him l@@ yn@@ n if he had done it .
&quot; but he att@@ acked their meaning and especially the meaning that you wrote , when the famous po@@ em of Emma Laz@@ arus 1903 , 17 years after completion of the monument , its base has been added . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta : &quot; I do not want to go on a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enlight@@ ens the world . &quot;
the po@@ em that you refer to which later was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty .
&quot; Miller is objective , but as he himself is form@@ ulated , it is not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary reson@@ ance on the u@@ pright words of Laz@@ arus , the only ones in which a state would not only invites any old imm@@ ig@@ rants to breathe your arms , to breathe free to breathe free to breathe free of your poor . &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; dis@@ gu@@ sting waste &quot; on our scre@@ ens was better to see .
Miller eng@@ ag@@ ed not in liter@@ ary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tru@@ mps USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a bro@@ ader political and cultural struggle : it is indeed a conflict for the meaning of America .
Laz@@ arus - and their friends who set up their words after their death at the base - did not know that they had a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between the French and American Republi@@ c@@ ism by putting them in an ab@@ used classical image representation the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom .
Laz@@ arus changed this meaning : in her po@@ em the female figure is no longer abstract - it has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the Ex@@ il@@ anten .
the connection of the po@@ em with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist Cou@@ p and a dev@@ ast@@ ating attack on American N@@ ati@@ mus .
&quot; and just like Laz@@ arus , the importance of the statue , people wanted to change the people from right wing this long time . &quot;
&quot; the great scri@@ be Rush Lim@@ per@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming from Tru@@ mp , arg@@ um@@ ented in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was pro@@ gres@@ sing , but rather an early ne@@ oc@@ on@@ ic@@ ative , which the American flame is moving into the um@@ na@@ fied world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward . &quot;
it is supposed to wear the tor@@ ches of the freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not shine the way into the United States . &quot;
rather unusual is Lim@@ per@@ gh here on something to be stopped .
the importance of the statue is entirely and certainly a matter of under@@ point of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative fact of Laz@@ arus consi@@ sted to see them as they were from the ex@@ haus@@ tive , el@@ itting , but hop@@ eless people after long and often terrible trips on the de@@ cks of ships . &quot;
&quot; it is in the tru@@ est sense that the world from the perspective of people see , re@@ fuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the will .
and this is of course not the perspective that Miller and Tru@@ mp would ever appreciate .
&quot; your f@@ ack@@ el should not enlight@@ en the way , but the hat@@ red , who is their only source of power , ign@@ ite . &quot;
World@@ champion@@ ship 2017 : N@@ eil Black lo@@ ves Scottish members of the team of Great Britain
E@@ ili@@ dh Do@@ yle re@@ minds of a time when only two Schot@@ ten to the team of Great Britain
&quot; the power @-@ director of the Athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ headed sch@@ ot@@ tic capac@@ it@@ ent will contribute to the team of a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of sch@@ ot@@ tic ath@@ let@@ en was selected for London 2017 that starts on Friday .
black believes that &quot; in Scotland has developed something special &quot; and the Athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom has to learn something out of it .
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it , until we find it out , &quot; said Black . &quot;
I speak with people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish ath@@ letes think that it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish ath@@ letes , med@@ als are med@@ als , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ MegMDH - which was elected by Sir Mon Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track , while E@@ ili@@ dh Do@@ yle was elected by the team to team &apos;s team . &quot;
&quot; ili@@ ie is rather mod@@ est .
&quot; their capit@@ alists were unbeliev@@ able , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of ath@@ letes , no matter whether they were scru@@ table or wherever they live or train , they went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motiv@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the real feel , the E@@ ili@@ ie had completely natural , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Common@@ wealth @-@ Silber@@ med@@ alli@@ sts who will join in their fifth world champion@@ ships at the 400 @-@ m @-@ hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; unbeliev@@ able &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s far the best total number of ath@@ letes at the World Championship was seven , the 1983 and 2015 were achieved . &quot;
the mid @-@ stre@@ et@@ ched Mu@@ ir leads along this path and has drawn up five British and two European recru@@ it last year .
&quot; it will participate in the 1,@@ 500 m and the 5,000 m length . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,@@ 500 m is another ver@@ rot , which one should look after a great season , which should be watching the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ yle was rem@@ ind@@ ed of their first world champion@@ ships , as the only other s@@ otte in the Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; the cre@@ sts capit@@ als says that they are &quot; enormous proud &quot; &quot; of the fact that many of their farmers do not only belong to the team , but in some cases even with the med@@ als and in the Fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; what particular team @-@ capit@@ als to be in it is that they have chosen by the other members of the team so that it anyway be a great honour , but to know that my team mates for me and have chosen to do something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots who belong to the team .
it shows only how far we have come .
&quot; and they are here as established ath@@ letes , ath@@ letes , who want to rise on Po@@ di@@ ums . &quot;
what my speech is concerned about capital ?
&quot; yes , I think they went well . &quot;
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world champion@@ ship .
so it is really important to put on this home assistance and benefit from it that we are back at the Olympi@@ ast@@ adi@@ on .
I got a second chance to go there and compete and it will simply be as a great atmosphere there .
block from cri@@ tics on Facebook : apply you not for a public post when you can not wear the use of sc@@ ulpt@@ ors
the Father of our country knew something of bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t last long until the newspapers took him because of the internal policy to its political principles . &quot;
he swe@@ eps in criticism , safe . &quot;
but he did not put his cri@@ tics .
&quot; for in the year 17@@ 83 said Washington : &quot; &quot; freedom of expression can be taken away - and , du@@ ous and st@@ um@@ m we are led as the sheep for batt@@ les . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Govern@@ or Lar@@ ry Hog@@ an , who has to work on it to be more like Washington . &quot;
Hog@@ an employee have been block@@ ed the contributions of at least 450 people and have been deleted that their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ple@@ aded him in the beginning of this week .
&quot; the stick of the govern@@ or sent the law@@ suit as fri@@ v@@ ol , and the online comment was full of a reaction with &quot; Na , and ? &quot;
&quot; it is just Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is particularly important if it is a type like Hog@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can govern@@ or in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazing .
he has the second part of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Hog@@ an is not a re@@ ac@@ tionary heat head .
he has shown a fixed hand on the leadership of his state and strict compliance with principles .
he was also very sent to use Facebook as a pri@@ ck means to connect with its sc@@ ulpt@@ ors and play his hair @-@ less head to chem@@ otherapy in his side .
&quot; therefore , the block@@ ages of individuals who are coming to the side of the Govern@@ or - which is a public forum that is paid as a officially and by employees that are paid by public tax dollars - un@@ necessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post Cor@@ rupted Hog@@ an , Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse the actions of the govern@@ or , and arg@@ um@@ ed that the block@@ ing of the comments has nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; but it is too simple to use the image of breast@@ feeding or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ ate people , which goes online the whi@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the Post spoke with some of the real people , which were block@@ ed by Hog@@ an . &quot;
&quot; and these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , an entre@@ pren@@ eur and a priest , not a tro@@ lle . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ght@@ ful and not pro@@ fan . &quot;
the past@@ el zi@@ pped the Bible in his post and app@@ elli@@ ed to Hog@@ an Catholic faith .
&quot; attor@@ ney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani by Bo@@ wie , MD . , was not h@@ ate , but she asked after h@@ ass@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; I commented polite , that I was disappointed that there was no response to H@@ ass@@ hi@@ re@@ chen and another current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary area of the news &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I appreciate this idea even if a number of people on the same subject takes position , then they are more widely accepted by some more than a so called &quot; &quot; collective commitment and not considered a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the employees of the Govern@@ or as &quot; focused spam @-@ attack &quot; would like other probably &quot; inter@@ actions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Facebook @-@ era makes it simple to cut a message by simply block a cri@@ tics or is deleted or a negative comment is deleted . &quot;
&quot; it is much cleaner than in early time , if one had done the same that staff were sent to collect newspapers with critical tails , and to burn or demonstr@@ ating or demonstr@@ ating or dis@@ assem@@ ble to silence . &quot;
but precisely this is just digital .
Hog@@ an is not the first public officials who has cri@@ tic@@ ised for it on Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp is acc@@ used by Twitter @-@ users who were block@@ ed by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
&quot; the chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County ver@@ last the First Am@@ end@@ ment , according to US Bezir@@ ks James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when they called a vot@@ ers from her Facebook page . &quot;
and in K@@ entu@@ cky received govern@@ or Matt population ( R ) also a visit to the AC@@ LU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so hard .
&quot; at the time Wash@@ ing@@ tons , the time of affordable port@@ os had a similar effect as the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous envelop@@ e on his guidance . &quot;
and even at that time Washington anonymous Tro@@ lle .
&quot; the people , the p@@ seud@@ ony@@ ms like &quot; J@@ uri@@ cola &quot; , &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; used , wrote all the letters in newspapers , the Wash@@ ing@@ tons decisions made . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions , based on its position on the contract of Am@@ ity , trade and boat trip with Great Britain to cri@@ tici@@ zed , stunning office , according to the historical documents that were collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he has not brought them to silence .
&quot; freedom of expression , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the basis of our nation . &quot;
and true leadership means to accept this .
Ron@@ an Ra@@ ffer@@ ty hopes on domestic comfort at the Renaissance club
&quot; the former Europeans No. 1 Ron@@ an Ra@@ ffer@@ ty will hope for the next three days in domestic comfort , since the Renaissance Club was held in East Lot@@ hi@@ an the 1st edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; Nor@@ di@@ re , which result@@ ed in the Arch@@ er@@ field links to the end of the next year before he connected to Paul E@@ ales , is associated with the new location and serve as the tournament &apos;s name and CE@@ O@@ s Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he reaches with this event his glory , &quot; said Ra@@ ffer@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from his best page , he is in a great condition . &quot;
Jerry has made a great job than he put this place .
he is an ei@@ fre@@ er suppor@@ ters of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great show@@ case for this course . &quot;
&quot; Engl@@ ish@@ man is looking forward to defend a champion@@ ship , even though he won his career at the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour . &quot;
&quot; this really feels especially interested in , &quot; &quot; said the South@@ port . &quot;
&quot; I have not able to defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open as it was in the year after I had won the program from the program . &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories of the last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on , last year here to win . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came to his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year to the European Senior tour , returns to the action on home . &quot;
this event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you can feel this additional print . &quot;
I really enjoyed it again and I played a stur@@ dy Gulf .

&quot; in the past two decades there are more and less people died because of passi@@ v@@ ating lung , lung cancer . &quot;
at this result scientists come from the University of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ ke ) in a study .

&quot; in the area of domestic violence , the situation is more complicated as susp@@ ect , since there is much a lot to see in the plans . &quot;
&quot; the traffic , the ever again the construction works , represents a big problem for the components of Stu@@ mp@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignor@@ ance of the motor@@ cyclists before red lights and lock@@ ers is already enormous , &quot; reported Hein@@ ze . &quot;

poverty and death in Indon@@ esian Gold@@ land
when B@@ ard@@ ina Deg@@ ei co@@ oks the dinner , she uses no stove . &quot;
it even rarely used a pot .
&quot; in its wooden house at En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai govern@@ ors in the un@@ quiet Indon@@ esian province Pap@@ ua , places the house@@ wife normally referred to as &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour the st@@ olen Kn@@ ol@@ le is taken with icy , unusual hands and encryp@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; Deg@@ ei is sitting on the mud - it has no furniture - where they also per@@ forms their daily work , e.g. gar@@ ments to wash water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bu@@ cket in a hom@@ eless area serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the young@@ est of the four wives of their husband were not assigned to her fields .
Poly@@ gam@@ ie is common here .
&quot; of course , late to work too are dangerous : most of the village are un@@ employed , and many drink heav@@ ily , and there are here the soldiers . &quot;
&quot; no one assu@@ mes that after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the Hoch@@ land of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a contro@@ versi@@ al refer@@ endum held in Indonesia as only 1,0@@ 26 Äl@@ ter should vote in front of the occup@@ ying stru@@ ck . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which conver@@ ts for independence against the Dutch rule , turned out to the government of Jak@@ arta that holds control over the region and foreign journ@@ alist or law@@ yer . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province officially became divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent part of Pap@@ ua @-@ Neu@@ gu@@ ine@@ as the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as sec@@ lu@@ ded as it is . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car rental .
there is no public transport .
&quot; the city with about 19@@ .000 inhabitants is made up of wooden houses , which are surrounded by bam@@ boo @-@ species , and made of cor@@ rug@@ ated plates that have been converted by r@@ ust in various pun@@ ished sounds . &quot;
&quot; only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , because journalists and practically no for@@ eig@@ ners . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries , cov@@ eted Me@@ e p@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans a God called U@@ GA tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; says Deg@@ ei and indicates their lively , hand@@ w@@ oven tur@@ ban , her dark shirts and their bright rock . &quot;
&quot; earlier , we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indon@@ esi@@ ed poor@@ est province where 28 % of men live under the mut@@ ation border and have some of the worst children &apos;s mort@@ ality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indon@@ esi@@ ens Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and most prof@@ itable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a strong@@ hold in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ ,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , Fre@@ ep@@ ort has been built in the value of 3,1 billion US dollars , gold and copper . &quot;
Pap@@ ua has over wood resources in the value of estimated 78 billion US dollars .
&quot; however , these wealth are a source of the afflic@@ tion for the Pap@@ ua who make sure that Indon@@ esi@@ ens are powerful military ten@@ ant presence . &quot;
&quot; a study from 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort local Mil@@ itar@@ ism and units between 1998 and 2004 almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150,000 U.S. dollar on a single offic@@ er . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ an demands for greater autonom@@ y threat@@ ening these golden go@@ ose and become mer@@ cil@@ ess@@ ly treated .
&quot; according to the details of ac@@ tivi@@ sts have been killed more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua and thousands of people have been rap@@ ed since 1969 from the Indon@@ esian military , tort@@ ured and dis@@ counted . &quot;
mass@@ ent@@ atives in Pap@@ u@@ as regul@@ es@@ land in the 1970 @-@ s were determined according to the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission to the gen@@ oci@@ de of gen@@ oci@@ de .
&quot; in the region , the Indon@@ esian police were more than 3.@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators in the past year . &quot;
&quot; we value in a report of the Arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese Bris@@ bane from year 2016 , in which reports are included in the reports on at@@ ro@@ cities and tort@@ ure - rap@@ e and electro@@ des are especially popular by another report - and the bru@@ tal pre@@ cip@@ itation of peaceful demonstr@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week , says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ researchers for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
the screws are ampli@@ fied because Pap@@ u@@ as resources have an influ@@ x of settlements from other parts of Indonesia .
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but the dem@@ ographic development changes themselves , since Muslim econom@@ ists from the complete islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ aw@@ esi come . &quot;

&quot; migrants have begun to sell chicken and vegetables at the traditional market less than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; says Ab@@ eth You , a 24 @-@ year Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ local , who moved to the province capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
it has the native Pap@@ ua - the mom @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; from Pap@@ ua - their market .
&quot; the Indon@@ esian president of Jok@@ o Wid@@ od@@ o , known in Volk@@ sm@@ und as Jok@@ ow@@ i , he spoke of the in@@ equ@@ alities and the in@@ viol@@ ations of the viol@@ ations in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
the former carp@@ enter 27 of the total 29 distric@@ ts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the pres@@ idential Palace in Jak@@ arta .
&quot; but in Pap@@ ua changed little , and today the loc@@ als feel che@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we agreed in 2014 to Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the expect@@ ation that he will fulfil our hopes that righteousness is restored , &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is in@@ augur@@ ation in October a deep point . &quot;
&quot; on 7 December 2014 there was a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas li@@ mbs in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , as two ind@@ on@@ esian soldiers on a motorcycle by the darkness . &quot;
the sc@@ iss@@ ors kids said to them that they should turn their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers participated in her tone and later came back with four soldiers , so the local past@@ or Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers , the dr@@ unk had , hunt , and sm@@ ote the group with their threads , they said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then became hor@@ ri@@ fied of the soldiers to the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , became so difficult for he fell into the com@@ a . &quot;
a few hours later the building was set to the nearby governmental comm@@ ission on fire and the items es@@ cal@@ ated the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered themselves on a football field in front of the local police station and the military comic centre to ask justice . &quot;
they were cerem@@ onial Jag@@ db@@ naires and carried out the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle and a bird @-@ s@@ ang im@@ it@@ ating - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e p@@ ago strain .
some prot@@ esters began stones on police and military po@@ sten .
&quot; when the atmosphere was appointed , the soldiers was sent to an internal fet@@ ched : &quot; if the masses had more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it is stated in an official document of TIME , which was not released in an official document of TIME , which has not been released on the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ emi@@ as Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego Kot@@ o @-@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threat@@ ening danger and called for rest and invited the amount to return home . &quot;
nobody was in the mood to listen .
&quot; when I turned into my left hand , I was suddenly shot in my left hand , he said TIME on the porch of its colour@@ ful man@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame knows still not , who has found , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the here gathered . &quot;
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were folded , &quot; add he added . &quot;
&quot; the local man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , such as his cous@@ in , the witness of the black@@ ness was . &quot;
&quot; I ran unto him and investig@@ ate his body to be sure he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans only carries a name to the TIME in glo@@ omy atmosphere . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I have to stop him .
&quot; the cheer@@ leader of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , said Rep@@ or@@ ters that his offic@@ ers were only &quot; &quot; back &quot; , &quot; because they are att@@ acked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people dro@@ ve to kill us , &quot; said the spok@@ es@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commission@@ er P@@ ud@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young prot@@ esters were killed and many others in@@ ju@@ red . &quot;
the news about the pot@@ ters arrived only on the following day &apos; filter@@ ed &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks held Jok@@ ow@@ i in Jay@@ ap@@ ura a passionate speech , in which he sympath@@ ies to the families of the victims and sw@@ elling , the historical mis@@ ors in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I would like that this case is immediately resolved , so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Jean @-@ minister E@@ anto said in October 2016 , that he initi@@ ated a court mechanism to appl@@ ying historic human rights viol@@ ations . &quot;
but the speech@@ es started almost immediately .
&quot; most of the in@@ jur@@ ies occurred a long time ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; the point is that we have committed to uph@@ old these viol@@ ations , but there are processes that have to go through , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then he made ey@@ anto a re@@ treat when he spoke on June 5th in Jak@@ arta with TIME and said , he has no plans to set up a compla@@ int mechanism . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything will be governed by law , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Wir@@ anto , who claimed the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; , &quot; said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua have already been introduced in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai procedure . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims took over such asser@@ tions with gri@@ pper .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there were no progress . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he was still alive in fear .
&quot; I have fear , &quot; &quot; says he . &quot;
&quot; I am afraid to be arrested from the military , I be afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ aco@@ bus repeti@@ tive the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai is afraid to discuss the inci@@ dent .
&quot; he says that he was taken from the military , after he helped to bury four of the victims . &quot;
&quot; after I buried the corp@@ ses , the military after me , &quot; says he . &quot;
the sk@@ et@@ ries have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indon@@ esian police on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a con@@ frontation between Dorf@@ inhab@@ it and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who stret@@ ched out to bring an un@@ conscious man to the hospital , died a person and 17 others were in@@ ju@@ red , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , the dro@@ w@@ ned when he was in a nearby river fis@@ her , died on the way to hospital . &quot;
elev@@ ated vill@@ agers were prot@@ ested in front of the business office of the company .
&quot; the police said that the vill@@ agers took stones on offic@@ ers , that re@@ acted by war@@ ri@@ fied . &quot;
yet some native to say that the mobile Brig@@ ade ( ind@@ on@@ esian par@@ am@@ ilit@@ ary police ) began to shoot the crowd and a kill .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be re@@ ven@@ ge , &quot; &quot; says the 29 @-@ year Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u Badi@@ i , who lives near the hospital , and witness was how the last one has been delivered here quickly , so the TIME . &quot;
&quot; I have hidden myself two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called to withdraw the offic@@ ers involved offic@@ ers and to withdraw the mobile Brig@@ ade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an Un@@ ru@@ h@@ eher@@ d for the Indon@@ esian government .
&quot; the lack of sensu@@ al development strength@@ ens the dis@@ satisfaction of the chiefs of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al who live in the green highlands of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the Free Pap@@ ua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the Reb@@ ellen@@ ar@@ me@@ e , who claims to defend the rights of Pap@@ ua by destro@@ ying spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and performances by ind@@ on@@ esian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top @-@ O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to the last few years , being arrested thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai and was arbit@@ r@@ ary in prison , under the pre@@ text of the &quot; sec@@ uring of national sover@@ eign@@ ty . &quot;
some dive never again .
&quot; among the people of Pap@@ ua is Pan@@ i@@ ai as &quot; a trag@@ ic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strength@@ ens the dis@@ satisfaction .
&quot; the little rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is expensive for loc@@ als . &quot;
bread is just as range .
people here are building everything they eat : especially Not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can edit four or five fields of Sweet pot@@ ato .
they reserve most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
&quot; ten pieces Not@@ a tast@@ ings only 10,000 ind@@ on@@ esian Rup@@ ies ( 75 C@@ ents ) . &quot;
in the course of time economic ine@@ quality have grown up between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants since the opening of new flo@@ at the airport Nab@@ ire in greater number .
the few jobs which are in the region usually go to the better trained and prosper@@ ous imm@@ ig@@ rants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to carry out their own business .
&quot; the young people are not interested in the village to stay ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John G@@ ob@@ ai , the chairman of the Chief Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
insulation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions of reporting international media remains ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year the French journ@@ alist Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Bas@@ ille Long@@ ch@@ amp because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua declar@@ es , although given to the rare permission to the films . &quot;
&quot; according to Ph@@ el@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy @-@ Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is campaigns , con@@ stitutes to promote transparency and development , not realis@@ ed by transparency and development . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indon@@ esi@@ ens and the eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua , and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indon@@ esian government remains largely restricted to the immediate neighb@@ ours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March six p@@ aci@@ dic states - Tong@@ a , N@@ aur@@ u , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the American islands - the UN @-@ Human Rights Reser@@ ved , the &quot; various and widely used injury &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Sch@@ ieß@@ erei . &quot;
the same countries have histor@@ ically been supported by the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spok@@ es@@ man of the Indon@@ esian Vo@@ r@@ man@@ atha Nas@@ ir pointed out the for@@ ac@@ cus@@ ation of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia is still a democratic system , and there are free media so that it is difficult to simpli@@ fy the evidence of human rights . &quot;
people on site want to take note that more foreign governments are aware of this .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human right bank of K@@ ees Van B@@ aar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura on 4 May visited , bra@@ ve loc@@ als and ur@@ ged him &quot; We want freedom &quot; , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the session , but would remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has another pres@@ idential election , but the Pap@@ ua say that they will probably be right again for Jok@@ ow@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good inten@@ tions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai nuts , says G@@ ob@@ ai the chairman of the stem Council . &quot;
&quot; he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that , that it is under the constant threat of a r@@ äu@@ ber@@ ian military . &quot;
G@@ ob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people like other Pap@@ ua who have to consider her voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; fault . &quot;
&quot; they do not need money , they just want justice , &quot; says he . &quot;
&quot; despite the thre@@ ats and in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Sch@@ uss@@ op@@ fer participated in a last symbo@@ lic act of Trot@@ sky@@ ism : the body of a sacrifice was buried in a field exactly to the police station and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that you might never come to justice , but at least they do not forget those responsible for their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ aco@@ bus with full head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;

&quot; it is the second fire that is called in only two years by the Hoch@@ haus , which is called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el @-@ Tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , in@@ jur@@ ies were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of flame . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we are stopped at the fire @-@ alarm and the weak@@ ness of the people . &quot;
&quot; we ran@@ ged the steps down , and it took about 10 minutes to come from the 50@@ th floor to come down , &quot; &quot; told one residents who made his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Du@@ ba@@ is civili@@ ans said that the units of fire fighting against 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 AM GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building was cool .

&quot; the inci@@ dent can ask questions about the security of materials , which are used in foreign areas of sky@@ scrap@@ ers all over the world . &quot;
&quot; a study carried out by the management of the gate @-@ building according to its fire in 2015 , that the largest part of the damage from the cl@@ adding , the exterior of decoration or isol@@ ation . &quot;

the President of the International Tennis Court ( IT@@ F ) is included with his great Davis Cup Cou@@ p upon the General Assembly .
&quot; at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h city , the award was supported for this sports revolutionary suggestion , Davis Cup show only on two pay@@ outs , hau@@ te@@ thin not supported by the necessary two @-@ third majority . &quot;
&quot; although often very long , but also very valu@@ ed Five @-@ Set classics remain with the tradition . &quot;
6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of member countries respon@@ ded to reform the aim of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only barely l@@ acks .
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members are not accepted the entire Re@@ for@@ mp@@ ak@@ et for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long term future of these ic@@ onic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
one will continue to work on it to improve the applic@@ ant .
&quot; not until vote was not only for the vote before the proposal , the finale came to a neutral place . &quot;
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively smaller details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be able to have the host right during the first round .
&quot; to reduce the costs of organis@@ er , the requirements in terms of training sets , etc. and the players will have to take less official media dates before the Davis Cup . &quot;
more than 1 out of 5 US trav@@ ellers brings down objects to the air@@ plane ; find a survey
&quot; a survey conducted under passengers that more than 20 percent are deli@@ ber@@ ately aware or deli@@ ber@@ ate objects at the check@@ points of US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 per cent that carried out the plane while acci@@ dental blades or other objects with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 percent said , they had been del@@ ayed away that they were mist@@ aken with Sch@@ uss@@ man , am@@ mun@@ ition , or explo@@ si@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; the survey of more than 1,000 persons - which was conducted by a jet @-@ Char@@ ter@@ service , which was carried out at Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , carried out that younger trav@@ ellers may rather be the rules . &quot;
&quot; by the respon@@ dents , tr@@ ench that they have tried to fly with something that were forbidden by the T@@ SA were 19.@@ 7 per cent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , members of the generation X . &quot;
&quot; the most common objects that were inten@@ tional to T@@ SA agents , were food@@ stu@@ ffs and liqui@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; more than 3 percent said to , kn@@ ow@@ ingly worn in objects with blades by the safety control , while 2.2 percent of female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that it was clearly stated in the plane . &quot;
&quot; the company said , I have trav@@ elled for trav@@ ellers in the whole country to find out how many acci@@ dent@@ ally imp@@ ug@@ ging sm@@ ug@@ ging by the air security , and how many things would have done inten@@ sel@@ y . &quot;
&quot; there is no surprise that people who bear in the most often sm@@ ug@@ ly , kn@@ ow@@ ingly or in@@ wis@@ ingly - through the safety , those who were most frequently flying . &quot;
&quot; however , the company indicates that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
&quot; people are often un@@ certain , which flu@@ ids may take them or how much of it . &quot;
so it is not a surprise that the largest number of liqui@@ ds are con@@ fis@@ c@@ ated objects in bot@@ any liqui@@ ds .
&quot; one time long thought the people , the T@@ SA could view books as Schm@@ ug@@ gel@@ ware . &quot;
&quot; flu@@ ids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k is no matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers
e @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k gives a huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
yet he has to pro@@ pose so that a part of the customer has already with@@ drawn their non @-@ binding reservation again .
&quot; in addition to the continually tri@@ ump@@ h@@ ate numbers of revenue and even gig@@ antic cow , Tes@@ la @-@ Chef El@@ on Mus@@ k at the announcement of the recent quar@@ ter@@ ly shar@@ ehol@@ ding : the canc@@ ell@@ ations in the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ k had frequently asked for the new car in recent months with the more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery straight begins . &quot;
&quot; now muscle : from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders are 63@@ ,000 have already been with@@ drawn again . &quot;
cri@@ tics had always pointed out again that it is only for non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; during a cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 po@@ unds ) . &quot;
&quot; currently , 45@@ 5.000 of such non @-@ binding reservations in front of , sp@@ atial me@@ k in a telephone conference with analy@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; for the cancellation of so far , some twelve per cent of all orders might become a problem , the Tes@@ la Boss believes . &quot;
&quot; his argument : the challenge for ambitious growth factors is not in demand , but on the production line . &quot;
last year Tes@@ la 84@@ .000 cars from .
&quot; 2018 , it is supposed to be up to all models - 500@@ .000 , to 2020 a million . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , there are currently per day 1800 reservations . &quot;

EP@@ A @-@ Chef Pru@@ itt is moving back to the rules of Obama @-@ Er@@ a to reduce emissions .
&quot; a day after having been c@@ ted from 15 states , Scott Pru@@ itt , the leader of the environmental protection authorities , his former decision back to delay the implementation of the rules of Obama to era to reduce emissions by smo@@ g transp@@ onders . &quot;
Pru@@ itt presented the change as his agency dedicated to the needs of state environmental authorities .
he did not mention the compla@@ int that was raised against his previous place in a Bundes@@ liga .
it is a deadline that ran on 1 October for states to comply with the standards of 2015 for a bottom of the o@@ zone .
&quot; Pru@@ itt announced in June , that he will delay the compliance with a year to study the plan to study the plan and to avoid &quot; focus in local decisions or economic growth . &quot;
&quot; Pru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tru@@ mp Prosec@@ ut@@ ney from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a long time a reliable opponent of strict environmental regulations . &quot;
&quot; since his arrival in Washington , Pru@@ gg@@ y has repe@@ at@@ edly have been repeated , regul@@ ating or delay in which the chemical industry and industry of fos@@ sil fu@@ els . &quot;
the su@@ dden revers@@ al from Wednesday is the most recent legal withdrawal of the Pru@@ it@@ ts regular Roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month has decided that the EP@@ A administrator has passed his authority as he tried to implement the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , oil and gas company for monitoring and reduction of meth@@ an@@ lec@@ tic li@@ abilities . &quot;
&quot; in one of the rec@@ alled opinion , Pru@@ gg@@ y proposed that his reci@@ pi@@ ent will simply intensi@@ fy the willingness of the EP@@ A to co @-@ operation with the states through the complex process of tim@@ ely performing the new standards . &quot;
&quot; earlier administ@@ rations , the EP@@ A often has maintained the dead@@ lines for the execution and then maintained by ac@@ tivi@@ sts groups , and others charged the date for carrying out , said Pru@@ itt , who used the EP@@ A more than a do@@ zen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation through judi@@ cial proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot;
we also accept the law and authority that gives us seriously .
&quot; nevertheless , the opinion adopted the EP@@ A that Pru@@ itt is at some point out his &quot; authority to del@@ ayed and all other legal requirements to ensure that the regulations &quot; are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the re@@ public@@ ans in the congress will be on a comprehensive framework of the o@@ zone rules .
one last month approved law is meant to delay the implementation of the rules in 2015 by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet provided in the Senate .
&quot; the New York @-@ General Heads of State by Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who passed the coalition of the States the EP@@ A in this week told , the group intended to maintain the legal pressure . &quot;
&quot; the conversion of the EP@@ A - according to our compla@@ int - is an important asset for the health and safety of these 6,@@ 7 million New York , and over 115 million Americans who flows directly from the smo@@ g , who fall into their municip@@ alities , &quot; &quot; said Cut@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; new York locked in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minnes@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ien , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot;

&quot; it is dist@@ urb@@ ing how much pressure it needs to breathe this rational step from those responsible for the protection of air we inhal@@ e , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Biological Diversity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need to fight against the ide@@ ological cru@@ ise of the Tru@@ mp government to get to environmental protection and their special interests . &quot;

Association wants to check the permission of Wind@@ bikes
Bo@@ is@@ heim w@@ anting me &quot; is not a legal prerequis@@ ite for the building and therefore looking forward to the betra@@ y@@ al .
&quot; the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim angry &quot; has to be called Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw his permission to the establishment of planned wind tur@@ bin@@ es in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
&quot; the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette had no wind tur@@ bin@@ es could have been approved , since at the time in Vier@@ sen only exists at the city border to Schwal@@ mt@@ al a wind @-@ force @-@ zone . &quot;
&quot; within this concent@@ rations , construction and operation of wind tur@@ bin@@ es are fundament@@ ally possible , at the same time passes the concent@@ rations but a exclusion of wind energy pol@@ lution to the rest of the city . &quot;
Der@@ lei zones are to prevent a &quot; &quot; spar@@ kling &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot;
&quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had a few days previously , due to an amend@@ ment of the hed@@ gehog splan@@ ts a second wind power zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette - but the district of Düsseldorf did not receive the district of Düsseldorf because of a form of form . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of plan@@ ing legal requirement is the ert@@ ed per@@ missions to act as illegal and therefore , Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens said , President of &apos; Bo@@ is@@ heim w@@ hon@@ ored &apos; . &quot;
current status of affairs : the city entered again the wind @-@ centr@@ ation@@ zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette decided ; a author@@ isation of the district government is still out .
Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; this is at this point the division of a permit for the establishment of wind tur@@ bin@@ es will be excluded .
the circle confirms the entrance of the request .
&quot; the corresponding writing have passed since past week at the circle Vier@@ sen , &quot; said a spok@@ es@@ man . &quot;
the circle takes her to the occasion to check the matter again .
they do not accept that the process is stopped .
&quot; with a view on ongoing method at the Board of Directors , the circle wanted not to be hon@@ ored to the arg@@ um@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , plans on an area at Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette the construction of four per 200 meters high wind . &quot;
&quot; already last year the company had joined the city of Vier@@ sen , panc@@ akes with the owner of approximately 65 hectares of large funds . &quot;
&quot; with construction of the four wind tur@@ bin@@ es , the power requirement is to be covered by around 11 400 househ@@ olds - this is equivalent to some five @-@ fifth generation of all four @-@ star househ@@ olds . &quot;
the NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros .
in the past summer four @-@ sens town@@ house there was green light for the purchase of three wind tur@@ bin@@ es in the wind park Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen and a stake in a wind energy facility in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district of Hein@@ sberg .

city and dealer are planning &quot; home @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; -@@ weekend

the commercial club and the city hall want to use the weekend on the 8th and 9th of September to lo@@ bes the inhabitants of the shopping centre in the city center .
&quot; as the Chairman of the Ge@@ werbe@@ ver@@ eins , Christian King , announced , the &quot; homeland @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; offers the customers for it sensitive , which offers their own city away from the usual supermarket @-@ goods . &quot;
&quot; planned , the market with regional suppliers , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
native companies are to present themselves with their expres@@ sions .
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city center can also invite to the &quot; &quot; midnight &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; here , the promotion is not only on the inhabitants of the city and the surrounding area . &quot;

also attractive offers on Saturday and finishing on parking at this day are part of the concept .
&quot; moreover , customer potential shall be new or re@@ conditioned . &quot;
these include c@@ guests and tourists .
&quot; however , many loc@@ als could have lost the downtown of shopping out of the view . &quot;
&quot; in the end , everyone would have to contribute to the city center - up to the land@@ lord , the operator of the whole city and clubs . &quot;
&quot; it succe@@ eded , to overcome it with a network the le@@ ather@@ arg@@ ie , who made it &apos;s spread , had King in spring . &quot;
&quot; Birgit St@@ reich , director of the I@@ HK @-@ Centers in Mühl@@ hausen shared with that on the nation@@ wide third &quot; &quot; homeland &quot; &quot; -@@ day , for the first time five Thuring@@ ian cities participate . &quot;

&quot; the day sol@@ le &quot; for appreci@@ ation of local trade adver@@ tise and its significance for the common of our cities become stronger , &quot; so stor@@ ing . &quot;
the action under the fe@@ athers of the I@@ HK and with many partners make it clear that every citizen should be influenced with its purchase @-@ level environment itself .

Tru@@ mp replaced after bor@@ ated tran@@ scription of phone call Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scription of telephone call between US @-@ President Donald Tru@@ mp and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by Washington Post .
&quot; on 27 January he called Tru@@ mp in a phone with the Mexican President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Ni@@ eto , public@@ ly to say that he would not pay for a planned bound@@ ary wall . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. President imp@@ lied him because he had public@@ ly den@@ ounc@@ ed the wall , he said to him , &quot; You can not say the press . &quot;
Tru@@ mp started its Pres@@ idency with the promise to set up a wall to the southern border of the USA and to leave Mexico for the project .

Mo@@ ores Ford @-@ mass@@ ac@@ re : ac@@ tivi@@ sts perform rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice back
&quot; a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury went through a group of spect@@ ators in rural Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and ru@@ led to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had to reach the bridge , a group of white men began to block its way . &quot;
the leader of the Mob@@ s - a man middle age in a needle @-@ suit - took a long move on his c@@ ig@@ ars and looked after the wind@@ shield .
inside sh@@ ake the occup@@ ants in fear .
&quot; we want this n lone r Roger ! &quot; bur@@ sts the man .
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
write down the silence when a young black man was drawn from the passenger .
&quot; luck@@ ily , this terrible scene was played on 22 July , just a statement . &quot;
&quot; but when then a loop is thro@@ wn by the neck of &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; , &quot; almost all of them in the audience is very true S@@ eu@@ f@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 I come back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to meet the night in the two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u K@@ lux Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
nobody was ever charged because of the murder .
&quot; it really is in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable that in all these years ago , even though we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps with the organization of delivery . &quot;
&quot; it is a mud@@ dy on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former Congress of the State of Georgia and a lifetime of a citizen .
&quot; for him , the statement as a dram@@ atic call for action and poses an annual memory of the Mon@@ roe Community , that an accident never was correc@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; we want a pro@@ sec@@ ution , we want to end the end , we want to healing , but first we have to receive righteousness , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; we can not get to cure and recon@@ ciliation , until we get righteousness . &quot;
a law@@ yer lays a du@@ el on the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ nie on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to F@@ BI , which were obtained from the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding Gra@@ f@@ ters were condem@@ ned . &quot;
but no one has ever been charged .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects for decades remain on free foot , civil rights that double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
in April 1946 a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice made the black citizens in Georgia for the first time to give their voice in the summer .
&quot; about the same time as choosing st@@ ach according to the data of the F@@ BI , Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a struggle - supp@@ os@@ edly , because of a woman . &quot;
&quot; Broo@@ ks said , the rum@@ or in the city has been , that H@@ ester with Mal@@ coms Mrs. Dor@@ othy slept and that the baby was carried , not by her husband . &quot;
&quot; on 25 July 1946 @-@ fied Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from the prison , so the F@@ BI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and their cous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to the prison .
&quot; but when she turned away from prison and closer to the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , around a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who has prepared and arranged the murder , it clos@@ es a F@@ BI &apos;s report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a completion between the state and local cri@@ minal v@@ ests that was not only involved in the murder , evidence and the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks form@@ ulates it again .
&quot; it was a election of law @-@ mass@@ ac@@ re , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; if you register , and if you agree , then you will happen here . &quot;
nearly one decade ago Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual membership of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
&quot; your account is vi@@ vid , and is justified in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , from which many believe that he did no longer exist in America . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to look , and still more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot;
&quot; we do not want to talk about the Lyn@@ n , because we will face with its hem@@ at@@ eness in all of us , &quot; &quot; said her . &quot;
&quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I made . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ hear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day at almost 30 actors - a do@@ zen wh@@ ites and the rest of black - in a room and loud , as Gre@@ ene had a well received overview of the piece started . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ens Co @-@ director .
&quot; he has played the role of the b@@ oss @-@ sound members for years , but he said that the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty , because I am not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it is very important to get this story on life , because we would not want to return to these times . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the room , the actor Dar@@ ri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the h@@ ester , and ur@@ ged him aw@@ aken it , that he has slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he , s@@ ander from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona er@@ adi@@ t the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene lau@@ gh at the loud .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; said Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and conf@@ used .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still k@@ ich@@ ern@@ d . &quot;
I don &apos;t believe that white people back then &apos; n --- he &apos; said .
&quot; but , swe@@ at one of the other black performers . &quot;
&quot; you only have to meet the har@@ sh &quot; &quot; R. &apos; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and exactly there shi@@ fts down the energy in the space , a feeling of com@@ rades will replace the dis@@ comfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy that this is really concerned , not only because of the game , but also because of memory of the four mur@@ dered people . &quot;
the scene starts again .
&quot; this time , when Ras@@ cona tells the N Word , he says it sharp and with re@@ printed . &quot;
absolutely no one laugh@@ s .
this repeti@@ tion ends viol@@ ent and fast .
&quot; there are spar@@ kling , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman , with a breath @-@ dress , stands on the corp@@ ses of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays grapes &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fru@@ it &quot; . &quot; &quot;
your voice breaks in every second word .
&quot; about a hundred meters , there is a group of about four do@@ zen spect@@ ators and t@@ ears out of the eyes . &quot;
the audience is divided by almost black and white .
&quot; a pair of I@@ th@@ aca , New York , anger@@ ed to see the performance , many come only the road . &quot;
they have experienced all the almost eight hours of Georgi@@ an impressive humidity if Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgri@@ mage to the gra@@ ins of the mal@@ coms and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; up to this point the murder of a An@@ ek@@ d@@ ote stood still , but now when you found in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels s@@ cour@@ age@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the song will sound , Gre@@ ene invites the amount to come closer and insp@@ ecting the corp@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ cken to their minds , register the f@@ ake blood and the breast@@ feeding body and whis@@ per each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; just dan@@ gling a little boy , as if they wanted to remember . &quot;
after a few minutes thanks Gre@@ ene the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw the Lyn@@ x away and w@@ anting their t@@ ears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh the man in the suit who has played the C@@ lan@@ member .
Nick Ras@@ en@@ um@@ ar@@ mt two of his fellow @-@ players and then breaks down in their arms , the emotional load of the performance breaks finally with him . &quot;
&quot; it is okay , &quot; whis@@ per@@ ed one of the women . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done this for one reason . &quot;
later the audience starts with the actors for dinner together .
at a table pl@@ au@@ dert a white pair of Atlanta stimul@@ ates about the extension with a black couple that they have just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski is about to find words that has left the performance .
&quot; it is difficult to hear these hor@@ ri@@ ble words and de@@ eds ... of people who look like yourself and doing this , because they look like you , &quot; &quot; said her . &quot;
&quot; what that really does with me , makes me believe that the Lyn@@ n is still going on , &quot; she added , &quot; today , it is called police force . &quot;
in the same room Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks Hof at his table , he eat and re@@ minds of civil rights . &quot;
he said he already started to plan the performance in the next year .
&quot; the statement in a way is inspir@@ ing , because it describes the fri@@ ght of what we have to bear , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is so , when we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; who does not study his own story , who does not know his own story is condem@@ ned to repeat them . &quot;

I draw a positive res@@ ent@@ me@@ e .
max amount works as a volunte@@ er .
you are working at several places in their volunte@@ er .
where everywhere ?
&quot; quantity : usually in Stein@@ furt in the furniture , I once more hel@@ pers here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I have already worked in the open whole day at school .
what are your experiences with it ?
&quot; quantity : it is a nice , wide spectrum that I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees with young adults . &quot;
they are now 26 years old and a bel@@ ated volunte@@ er .
how does it come ?
quantity : I did Ab@@ it@@ ur .
&quot; and then a design study , let us say , successfully inter@@ rupted . &quot;
I know for me that it is for me and I want to do something else with people .
and then I asked me what do you do .
&quot; do a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , at the burning point maybe . &quot;
and was it so ?
quantity : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the winter sem@@ ester .
&quot; I will study a dual @-@ study , probably in the Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne , a social @-@ worker and study in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hochschule . &quot;
is it not a bit unusual to have several different applications for volunte@@ ers ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it is probably always on how to make his FS@@ J .
it is possible to do it from Alter@@ sheim to youth @-@ work - in all sorts of fac@@ ets of social labour .
with me it was very varied .
&quot; I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care . &quot;
for me this was exactly the right thing with me .
I could det@@ ect my own strengths and see how it really proce@@ eds .
different from abroad ?
&quot; quantity : well clear , here it is not meant to be st@@ atis@@ fied . &quot;
one still has other people pre@@ am@@ ble head to have a quite different story behind them .
&quot; whether a re@@ fuge@@ e , whether a youth who has been fet@@ ched out of the family - one must always be one individually . &quot;
Google +
and you had no justi@@ fications ?
&quot; quantity : for this I am not the guy . &quot;
it is a field that gives a lot .
&quot; great love , a lot of kindness . &quot;
there is also negative moments but so life is just .

EP@@ A returns to the delay of the smo@@ g rule according to Kl@@ agen
&quot; the US @-@ American environmental protection has a decision to establish a regulation of the government of Obama to delay , the states that states are oblig@@ ed to comply with the Smo@@ g @-@ caus@@ ative emissions . this was a day after 15 states the Agency due to the stri@@ de . &quot;
&quot; the EP@@ A announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so called &quot; &quot; Oz@@ on@@ policy 2015 &quot; , &quot; and said , they show the commitment of the agency with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and remember that we respond to our state partners , &quot; said EP@@ A @-@ Chef Scott Pru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; Pru@@ itt had announced in June the intention of the EP@@ A , the oc@@ eans must be measured in which in a part of the country of damage , to set up where inc@@ isions must be made to dev@@ out strict avi@@ ation standards - to delay around a year until October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 largely mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , on Tuesday Kl@@ age and said that the effort is illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to imp@@ ose a wide range of environmental imp@@ acts , which has impos@@ ed the former President Barack Obama as part of a bro@@ ader agenda , which is to boost growth and economic growth . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have trig@@ ger@@ ed the withdrawal of the democr@@ ats and natural reserves , which are worried about the effects of greater emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the website of the EP@@ A says that the inhal@@ ation of air , the o@@ zone can reduce the lung function and strengthen the breath@@ able symptoms , such as as@@ thma . &quot;
Trink@@ halle
at the end the decision was clear : at two counter@@ s deci@@ des the council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ tz@@ aly the establishment of a common area in the future sen@@ i@@ oren@@ ment complex .
&quot; before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still missing foundation , the Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; though , it will still be last until the so far the par@@ est part of the par@@ ish area is in the community of the community , but there is no plant@@ ation for that of a private invest@@ or . &quot;
&quot; for this , there is a discussion concerning a common area . &quot;
&quot; one of the two investors , which are still in the boat , offered in the community . &quot;
on the ground floor it would provide a living area - about 55 square metres - and an ad@@ joining terrace with all 70 square metres surface for a special price .
&quot; the administration and the majority of the community of the community against such a common area , not as meeting point for the inhabitants of the sen@@ sus @-@ up residence , but open to the community . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word made from &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; recon@@ ciliation , the decision will have been decided by providing funds for the ongoing budget in the past autumn , by convey@@ ing possibilities . &quot;
the building is in the sanitary area .
&quot; the establishment of a common area would be reported that T@@ j@@ aden reports , with 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the resolution sees to sign@@ aling to the invest@@ or that one wants to throw him in this respect for both s@@ addle , which is taken to him - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - what the sor@@ row is reduced and the construction economic power - it would be possible . &quot;
&quot; Ne@@ ed@@ less , so does not only Wil@@ fried So@@ h@@ mer , be this addition . &quot;
if &apos;s helps : un@@ anim@@ ously he happens the panel .
not so easy it goes to the common area .
&quot; Daniela calls points to the many own buildings , with which one is not so wrong with the common area of the window , she says : &quot; I do so hard with it . &quot;
Yvonne Sta@@ ins absolutely speaks for the common space - but absolutely against a municip@@ al participation .
she sees behind it a negoti@@ ated sub@@ si@@ ev@@ ing of ohn@@ in fort@@ une or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not so , because with the acquisition of the area you can not give any write , but get a real , in the branch of the two @-@ line counter is counter@@ part , is the counter@@ part . &quot;
&quot; Sta@@ ig@@ ers request , the decisions according to the order , you will find three advoc@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; so it remains with two counter@@ voices at the original program , the Stefan H@@ aller so summ@@ oned : &quot; &quot; if we put the decision making the decision making a huge step in our infrastructure . &quot;

walk in the resin of star to star
in the Har@@ z the nation@@ wide first &quot; star @-@ fa@@ d &quot; arise .
this is planning the association observ@@ atory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a plan@@ etary way in Gött@@ ingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; star @-@ fa@@ d &quot; &quot; come to the information from many Har@@ z@@ visitors , it was called . &quot;
&quot; he compound nature , science , movement and sport@@ ing performance . &quot;
members want to travel along the planned route tables and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; during the first phase of 2018 , the association &quot; well achiev@@ able installations at five to six locations &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; survey St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ en@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber . &quot;
the information on the tables are to be suppl@@ em@@ ented by the internet .
that is why the location play a good mobil@@ net @-@ reception a role .
also Acces@@ sibility to be a c@@ rit@@ erion .
&quot; later , the star @-@ character train is to be extended by train . &quot;
&quot; on the star @-@ fa@@ d , the view@@ ers learn a lot of knowledge , for example on the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they learned why stars have different colors or why a star would have more light than another , even though it is much further away . &quot;
I will also be con@@ veys in which con@@ stellation can be a selected star where he will be best to see .
the association operates around since 2014 at the Berg@@ städ@@ t St. Andre@@ as@@ berg at the highest location observ@@ atory North@@ west .
the location in the heart of the Har@@ z National Park is part of the Federal Office of Natur@@ schutz for the six dark regions in Germany .
&quot; often , from there the Mil@@ ky way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a @-@ galax@@ y with naked eye can see clearly . &quot;
in the university town there has been an initiative of the promot@@ er plan@@ ing some simil@@ arities such as the planned star@@ ters - the plan@@ etary path .
&quot; starting from Geb@@ h@@ ards Hotel in Go@@ eth@@ e@@ al@@ lee , which forms the interior of our solar system , the plan@@ etary path leads up to Hain@@ berg and to the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extr@@ ater@@ re@@ strial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( village gli@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the stom@@ ach@@ s with the individual planets - including the Zwer@@ g@@ plan@@ ed de@@ gra@@ ded Plu@@ to at End@@ punkt - are precisely in the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth sch@@ ru@@ mp@@ ft so on a bul@@ let of 6,5 millimeters in diameter , while exactly 75 meters away standing sun at least 70 cen@@ timet@@ ers . &quot;
the entire distance of the plan@@ etary distance is about four kilometers .
&quot; while the light of sun up to Plu@@ to about eight hours requires pedestri@@ ans a good hour to the St@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot;
&quot; pedestri@@ ans are more faster than the light in the cosmos . &quot;
the march for next fix@@ ing but would take a half a year .

&quot; as the couple of photos pos@@ ed , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is climate , that a possible show@@ down between the batt@@ les will be the &quot; perfect size &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am an old spring weight , &quot; rem@@ ind@@ ed sh@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; I got up for Bron@@ x &#91; to 140 Pf@@ und &#93; , but I am not so big . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I would like to run down on lightweight .
and he must move on corp@@ ses &#91; 135 po@@ unds &#93; and then we are fighting .
these require the fans .
let us give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ an atmosph@@ eric .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
&quot; climate asked whether it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy , Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia to arrange a date ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) of which are also interested in the fight against the winner of J@@ orge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell according to their lightweight cover @-@ cover in the Forum on September 23 . &quot;
&quot; this fight could take place in the pay @-@ per @-@ view mode , because all fans have asked for him , &quot; said Gar@@ cia and oppressed you later to fight with the network that offer the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this type of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , he sets Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; a trem@@ endous strug@@ gles , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday battle . &quot;

four ten@@ sions after tire @-@ bur@@ sts
&quot; during an accident on the A7 , on Thursday afternoon four people were difficult to hurt . &quot;
&quot; after first information lost the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira against 16.30 hrs . shortly before the connector &apos;s market , probably after a tire stop the control over his vehicle . &quot;
&quot; the cars from home to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he proposed and then remained on the roof in the GR@@ UN@@ N@@ ST@@ RE@@ IF@@ EN . &quot;
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were heav@@ ily viol@@ ated during the accident .
&quot; during the first supply of the last through the ambul@@ ance service the A7 motorway was locked in the north for about an hour , then the traffic could be re@@ directed at the left film@@ strip to the accident . &quot;
Fort@@ un@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; Drei@@ erk@@ ette works better &quot;
&quot; And@@ re Hoffmann hop@@ ed after 2 : 2 to the end of the season against Braunschweig , that brings the optimization of the def@@ enses in Au@@ e points . &quot;
&quot; with the first season , And@@ re Hoffmann is pleased with the result , there were not the two oppos@@ ites at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two oppos@@ ites too much , and we must fit into Au@@ e even better , &quot; says the def@@ enses from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; the Or@@ e Mountains , the tri@@ angles should also be optimized further . &quot;
and a gate to a fre@@ ez@@ ing would no longer wish to catch the Fort@@ un@@ as .
&quot; for the future , it will be so that no more besides Michael ( R@@ ensing ) will be on line . &quot;
&quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better to justi@@ fy the experience in preparation with the tri@@ angles , than with the four @-@ cabin . &quot;
&quot; yet I do not know how we are going to act in Au@@ e , but Hoffmann is his thing certain because we have just been able to build up in the tri@@ als in KA@@ AN Ay@@ han and Nik@@ o G@@ ieß@@ el@@ mann players who can well build up well . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ condition is , but that we are even better harmon@@ ize and we do not achieve so many ab@@ omin@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann is also going to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but if one can speak after a draw from a mis@@ sive start , do not know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we can concentrate on Sunday with four points and we can concentrate on the trop@@ hy , we will certainly speak of a neat season . &quot;
of which I wanted to know nothing .
&quot; the start in the season Be@@ enced I only had to speak for six to eight players , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el who would not speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , only because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim pre@@ matur@@ ely had to be broken because of an un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season qu@@ asi with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann that players from Au@@ e might even be some fresh , since they had no he@@ ed and complete game like Fort@@ una against a asc@@ ension in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know so 100 @-@ process where they are currently standing , &quot; says the interior of the Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; while the guests come from the Rhineland as a light favorite on Sunday , on Sunday ( almost ) finished stages of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we put them away , only because we have the claim to come under the first six , is Bl@@ ö@@ d@@ resses , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance was quite positive at only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine playing . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga that one has to beat . &quot; &quot; explains Fort@@ un@@ as Ch@@ ef@@ coach . &quot;
&quot; such a statement to meeting would be arro@@ gan@@ t , and exc@@ eed . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el will not experience his player on Sunday in no case .
new results of the Swedish as@@ yl@@ um holder published
&quot; the recent results of tests for as@@ yl@@ um seek@@ ers in Sweden , who were subj@@ ected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 per cent of the tested people older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authority for For@@ ens@@ ische Medicine ( Rät@@ t@@ agli@@ cin@@ al@@ at@@ et ) has begun with the implementation of the tests last year .
&quot; they are to be more specifically exact during the A@@ syl@@ um and the evaluation of the age , after the Swedish Mig@@ rating authority ( migrants studies ) because of the assessment of the correct age of some refugees were cri@@ tic@@ ised the min@@ der@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; until today Mig@@ r@@ ations res@@ et 6,@@ 880 reviews and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now been sent the results of a total of 2,@@ 481 tests from the period from mid March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; eight@@ y percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in other 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency ass@@ essed that the person &apos; may be 18 years or older . &quot;
in 432 the conclusion was the conclusion that the person may be under 18 years old .
the tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is asked .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the Forensic Medicine Agency , the results are ste@@ adily available during the past months . &quot;
&quot; we do not see a huge difference in statistics of past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high proportion of cases , in which the person has been judged as over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the as@@ yl@@ um seek@@ ers has become over his age . &quot;
&quot; in May the agency released the results of 581 tests and said that there is 442 cases , the pro@@ pose that the lower person 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bl@@ a@@ det the 581 published results published , she turned out that in 243 of these cases the person had been open that she will be in the year 18 years old . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical evaluation that are analy@@ zed in the rays of Wei@@ sh@@ eri@@ zation and MR@@ T recordings of tricks , which are then analy@@ zed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , was also cri@@ tic@@ ised in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a sc@@ ep@@ tics is the end@@ oc@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute , whose work involves the assessment of the biological matur@@ ity of people to see whether they went earlier or later than usually by pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I do not believe that the type of measurement should be used . &quot;
to judge the biological age in this way is very un@@ certain .
&quot; if we cannot say it sure we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the Forensic Medicine Agency announced the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk , a child as an adult is un@@ correct to judge . &quot;
&quot; the biggest risk lies in it when the person is under 18 , in this case , this is approximately 10 per cent . &quot;

Af@@ gan@@ stein in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : under Prot@@ est at German pot@@ ato
&quot; yes , it does not come so often that parties go to a rope , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) is coming together , what else is hard to bring about a hat . &quot;

&quot; but those who are already done before the event at the beginning of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ ters , but demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Ei@@ fel remain colorful . &quot;
&quot; originally the city pic@@ nic is planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; at the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now on the parking place below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the rect@@ um event in the Stadthalle . &quot;

&quot; the police took many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence especially at the station that is only a few meters from the venues . &quot;
how is the rect@@ um came on Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes from the Af@@ d volcan@@ oes reported that he got to make such an event and get the supplement .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked about , but there was a cancellation , because because of the already built @-@ in Laur@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes not enough parking available . &quot;
&quot; so , the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot;
&quot; with a view of the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , he says : &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; this also does it : against 20 o &apos;clock , on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle several Red@@ ner , including the Ober@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ine Af@@ D @-@ chairman Uwe Young . &quot;
&quot; in the hall there are about 200 listen@@ ers to wait for the pointed candidate for the colour@@ ful holiday , Alice Wei@@ del , and the dep@@ uty chairman of the stor@@ k of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; un@@ changed is the police presence , but so far the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; a little more than an hour takes the Af@@ D event , the guests at the court have a longer breath , but also there is short after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police may recover - no special occurr@@ ence .

this is Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter at the prestigious Concer@@ tgeb@@ ouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ aun@@ is the SWR Symphon@@ ie@@ orchester .
both are united the desire to exc@@ eed the limits of their instruments but also the limits of different gen@@ res .

bank@@ rupt@@ cy Stew@@ art talks about her Bis@@ exual
some people love gr@@ illed cheese and will eat it to the end of their lives .
&quot; but I want to try everything , so Kri@@ sten Stew@@ art is quite open to their bite . &quot;
&quot; if I once were in gr@@ illed cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the most known relationship of the Holl@@ y@@ wood@@ lands was that too her &quot; &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; -@@ colle@@ ague Robert Patt@@ inson which ultimately was bitter .
&quot; despite the in@@ sured the brunette van@@ ity opposite the &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; I was in every seriously now I remember . &quot;
&quot; or believe you about , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after her separation was cri@@ tic@@ ised that they bis@@ exual , &quot; &quot; I have always lived the du@@ alism and seriously believed . &quot;
so it has never conf@@ used or dis@@ solved .
I never liked it to be taken seriously .
&quot; especially among them , they have according to &quot; &quot; Bang Show@@ biz &quot; , &quot; but in school time , when they prefer like a bu@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really has hurt me .
&quot; when I was eleven told me the children , I would look like a Bu@@ b . &quot;
I really felt att@@ acked , fri@@ ght@@ ened and ash@@ amed . &quot;
&quot; now I look back and think to me , &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
&quot; especially the public er@@ kl@@ es they do not like to live their love , &quot; people expect you in a certain way and that anno@@ yed me . &quot;
&quot; and maybe some as und@@ eni@@ able , but I don &apos;t like it to justi@@ fy myself before the whole public . &quot;
govern@@ or of West Virginia anno@@ unces that he changes the party
&quot; the Democratic Govern@@ or of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thurs@@ day@@ evening with a manifestation with President Tru@@ mp that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; said govern@@ or Justice . &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thinking ... today I will tell you as a inhabitants of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic govern@@ or . &quot;
the r@@ ally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the re@@ Republi@@ cans , &quot;
&quot; as a trainer I would say that it is at the time , another game to play . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp was formerly a big announcement at the West Virginia R@@ all@@ ye .
Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice does not endor@@ se the democratic candidate than Clinton .
&quot; Justice , who according to For@@ bes of the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state has been elected . &quot;
&quot; For@@ bes turns firmly that he poss@@ essed Koh@@ an in five states , and told by his father a carbon@@ ate . &quot;
it is worth 1,@@ 59 billion dollars . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime the Republi@@ can National Committee on Thurs@@ day@@ evening there was a statement in which it said : &quot; &quot; the party change of Govern@@ or Justice is another blow for a democratic party that would like to work more , in order to make our country again great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least law@@ ful body@@ work in history , the announcement of Govern@@ or Justice is only the final rej@@ ection of a party , which is from above until below without leadership , and not able to find a positive , decrease message , &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ chairman Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the CB@@ S News . &quot;
Co@@ E pra@@ ises the &quot; Russian &quot; Russian &quot; &quot; for Dop@@ ing @-@ Sk@@ andal &quot;

&quot; Russian Athle@@ tics D@@ mit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress at the eve of the Athle@@ tics World Championship , that the ex@@ ile of his country was correct from the sport and that he decided to fight the Dop@@ ing . &quot;
he said it tu@@ g to him for &quot; all ath@@ letes , to those in competitions of gold and silver med@@ als . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress for maintaining the ground@@ ing , which was completed in November 2015 , after a report of the world @-@ anti @-@ dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) hin@@ ts on state @-@ funded dop@@ ing in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought , it was a very open answer , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ E the Rep@@ or@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has seen in itself , that they have experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is new . &quot;
&quot; Co@@ E said he was &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for his ind@@ entation . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been achieved , but the Congress also supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia , said Co@@ E . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot;
&quot; the leit@@ principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean ath@@ letes from the cor@@ rupt system , he added . &quot;
&quot; nin@@ et@@ een Russian ath@@ letes are beginning to join the Athle@@ tics World Championship , which will start on Friday in London according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria . &quot;
&quot; the head of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday , Russia had to fulfil some of the criteria for a re@@ setting . &quot;
&quot; drug tests are still in@@ sufficient and forbidden Trainer be still free , he said Rep@@ or@@ ters in London after a lecture at IA@@ AF Council . &quot;

CD@@ U and F@@ DP before the possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; pre@@ ventive Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) is after the loss of red @-@ green ruling class for a quick re@@ mn@@ ant of the country , but he does not want to come back . &quot;
&quot; because , on Friday for the resolution of the Parliament . &quot;
previously the surprising Austr@@ itt of a Green M@@ EP@@ s had trou@@ bled from their land@@ day in Lower Saxony the government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) in a serious crisis .
&quot; five months before the official date of the day@@ time election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hannover thus lost its scar@@ ce a @-@ voices majority in the parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the old Green MP@@ s El@@ ke T@@ west co@@ ded its step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election 2018 in their elect@@ rics in Rot@@ enburg ( desert ) .

&quot; with this , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had come together 69 seats in the Dutch land@@ day , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
&quot; so far , the relationship was conver@@ sel@@ y . &quot;
the new land@@ day will be re@@ v@@ oted on 14 January next year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said that the red @-@ green federal government has now decide whether they can continue in this situation without a majority .
&quot; Stephan W@@ eil also holds true for indi@@ ab@@ ding@@ able , that the land@@ day as soon as its self @-@ resolution deci@@ des . &quot;
the CD@@ U group is expected to decide on Tuesday through its further advance .
the state of the state also sees the possibility to withdraw that the land@@ day of the Prime Minister has moved the confidence and select a successor .
&quot; our Constitution provides several options .
&quot; these options have to be legally checked clean , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; one will receive any questions in peace , if they are legally defined reasonable . &quot;
&quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler named T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; &quot; somewhat cur@@ i@@ os . &quot;
the poli@@ ti@@ cian itself said : &quot; I am no tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
it was marked as a pend@@ ant of black @-@ green .

they have deli@@ ber@@ ately decided not to result in the fac@@ tion of the fac@@ tion .
&quot; also in front of the background that there were no content differences , we cannot draw this step . &quot;
SPD ch@@ anc@@ ellor Martin Schulz condem@@ ned the transition of the Dutch Gre@@ eks El@@ ke T@@ west to the CD@@ U as a betra@@ y@@ al .
&quot; the behaviour of the former Green MP@@ s in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ y@@ al of the W@@ ow@@ ers and weigh@@ ers , but also betra@@ y@@ al to red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the bund@@ le of Socialists &amp; Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot;

&quot; Agric@@ ultural Minister in Interview - How do we protect us from tox@@ ics , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discussed about ver@@ se@@ u@@ ge Eg@@ gs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect consumers .
Land@@ wirtschafts@@ Minister Christian Schmidt ( C@@ SU ) is held in an interview with the release network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr. Schmidt , How can the consumer protect themselves from po@@ ison@@ ed eggs ? &quot;
I can only encourage all consumer and consumers to check the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp .
&quot; on the consumer protection , www.@@ gro@@ war@@ n@@ ung.de , the Bundes@@ länder will provide the latest information on the affected eggs . &quot;
affected Eg@@ gs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if after everything we are currently active , a health end@@ anger@@ ing is practically impossible . &quot;
&quot; now , Al@@ di now assu@@ mes the best possible crisis of crisis - all eggs , from the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fication of the federal government is not really perc@@ eived ? &quot;
the food @-@ monitoring is the task of the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has un@@ folded up and has been on the affected of the affected of Germany in close cooperation with the authorities of the countries . &quot;
all information and the risk assessment are available for consumers .
trade is exactly the same as the manufacturer to ensure that the sales of sales and health is harm@@ less .
&quot; if we exce@@ eded with eggs of the back @-@ level content of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , these are not dis@@ able . &quot;
Un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consu@@ med .
this time not the operations to bl@@ ame .
sitting production and consumers at the same boat ?
according to the deadline has no immediate gu@@ ilt .
&quot; rather , they have to count on certain illegal practices of service companies with economic damages . &quot;
as always there is too little contro@@ l@@ ure in the harvest .
is there only a staff or also at the clever competence ?
&quot; however , there were just the official controls that have revealed the process . &quot;
&quot; however , the truth is also that food @-@ frau@@ d and cri@@ minal energy can never be ru@@ led to 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; it is precisely because of this , a consequ@@ ent enlight@@ enment of such action and the commit to the Prosec@@ ut@@ ors in cases where imp@@ lies are of decisive importance . &quot;
I have already done multiple times that I expect from the competent authorities to enlight@@ ened authority .
is the regular al@@ ert@@ m in food sc@@ ales really necessary ?
consumers and consumers have the right to get a safe and beneficial food .
if a not acci@@ dent@@ ally inser@@ ted insec@@ tici@@ des in the food industry are consumer as well as consumers have been right@@ ed .
&quot; by the emb@@ oss@@ ed means , manufacturers , dealer and consumers in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of the In@@ sec@@ tici@@ des Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ supply animals is not removable and must be stopped immediately . &quot;
it has to be consistent and work with high pressure on all levels .
I expect from all the competent authorities that the atom@@ ic facts will be removed quickly and l@@ ur@@ lessly .
how the financial rules of the foot@@ balls on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moved to Paris
&quot; the rules that aims to prevent and prevent spending on European football , N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain . &quot;
&quot; any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the U@@ EF@@ A , because the leading organization led the power , cre@@ ws of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
financial Fair @-@ Play rules that have been launched in 2011 by the U@@ EF@@ A in 2011 that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has to be financed by N@@ ey@@ mar without large losses .
&quot; Barcelona has paid 222 million Euros ( 262 million $ ) to figure out the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a sal@@ ary that will be several ten million dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moved to France .
&quot; PSG can make sure the money lo@@ cker that N@@ ey@@ mar writes and bring it into a galax@@ y of other stars , given the financing of the team through the energy of rich ru@@ lers family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; clubs may apply a lot of money for the purchase of players a lot of money , but have to be done with legi@@ timate wor@@ shi@@ ms that allow them to give the break @-@ E@@ ven point in their focus on football @-@ related business . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel plat@@ ini after his choice to the U@@ EF@@ A president in 2007 .
&quot; the former French players believed that , in their pur@@ suit of success trem@@ endous shoul@@ ders had taken to ru@@ led and ris@@ ky to ru@@ in when banks or owners have returned their support . &quot;
in 2011 FF@@ P from concentration on debt to debt to the monitoring of their losses .
&quot; the change significantly , that the business model , the novel of Abr@@ amo@@ vi@@ ch originally purchased 2003 in Chelsea used - a club with potential buy and then vig@@ or@@ ously invested in order to build the team and build a global brand - to a tou@@ g@@ her issue . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P @-@ pre@@ disposition , which runs until 2018 , Club losses can take losses into the amount of 30 million euros . &quot;
&quot; and although plat@@ ini had fallen from the pres@@ idency of the cat@@ on@@ nade , its U@@ EF@@ A success@@ ors Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continue to stop there , from exc@@ es@@ sive expen@@ di@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; certainly is FF@@ P not dead and we will still strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea tra@@ ver@@ so that is responsible for the U@@ EF@@ A for FF@@ P , opposite The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week . &quot;
&quot; although the PSG has paid the buy @-@ out cl@@ ause from N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distri@@ bute the amount for invo@@ icing on the duration of its treat@@ y . &quot;
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year deal with so that the out@@ si@@ stem@@ s can be evaluated for the next five years in the amount of € 4@@ 4,4 million euros in the year .
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has increased the PSG along with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PSG received a bankn@@ ote from 60 million Euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which later was reduced to 20 million euros , and it was arranged that the teams of the season 2014 / 15 to 21 players will be limited to 21 players instead of normal 25 players . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ EF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to sur@@ render their financial supervision by offering their earnings by companies , which are connected to the owners of a clubs . &quot;
&quot; while a cat@@ ar@@ ic company may be transp@@ onders if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exc@@ eed the standard mark@@ ings , the U@@ EF@@ A would not apply it as a legi@@ timate income . &quot;
&quot; exactly this happened in 2014 , when the U@@ EF@@ A decided that the value of the PS@@ A was raised by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
it was reported that a part of the PSG payments to N@@ ey@@ mar would be made by payments of the organisation Committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar .
but PSG and Kat@@ ar 2022 have disp@@ uted that N@@ ey@@ mar World Cup will be to figure out and find a der@@ ive man@@ eu@@ ver for the U@@ EF@@ A regulatory authorities .
&quot; the previous sanctions against PSG mean that the U@@ EF@@ A will be more attention , every attempt to observe the rules . &quot;
the U@@ EF@@ A had no pre @-@ prepared discussions with PSG about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
&quot; they spoke under the condition of anony@@ m@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since they were not to discuss the PSG situation . &quot;
the recent published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 with a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million euros has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year must be published .
PSG expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Arri@@ val a blessing for sponsor@@ ing @-@ to @-@ de@@ as , mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and Tri@@ kot@@ at@@ ters . &quot;
the association is derived from that sales by signing up at least 30 per cent will rise .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players go to see , and tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s departure by claimed that PSG the FF@@ P vulner@@ abilities . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar . &quot;
Ar@@ sen@@ al @-@ Manager Ar@@ sen@@ e W@@ enger , whose club is owned by a American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a state that is funded by an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the owner , and this has completely changed the entire landscape of the foot balls within the last 15 years , said W@@ enger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it will be very difficult to respect the financial Fair@@ play , because you have different paths or have different interests if a country has such a major actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new sword @-@ supplier
in the past few years cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y Bord @-@ chocolate is made for the Swiss .
&quot; now , the s@@ alty collaboration is in front of one possible end : the air@@ line writes the order now . &quot;

approximately 17 million small rot@@ ors packed pen@@ alty up to 14 grams per year the aircraft in front of the land@@ ing to the passengers .
about the costs that Swiss does not want to make any information .
&quot; industry information value the contract volume according to &quot; Nord@@ west@@ ag &quot; at 1.5 to 2 million fran@@ cs - the Mig@@ ros @-@ daughter generates an annual revenue of approximately one billion fran@@ cs . &quot;
but more important is all@@ em@@ al of the adver@@ t effect : for a ch@@ og@@ gi@@ ble it is an prestigious order .
&quot; how many applic@@ ants , there are the new announcement in the new announcement , the Swiss does not want to be missed . &quot;
but only Swiss manufacturers are coming .

no@@ stal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the ni@@ che
&quot; this repeti@@ tion of history is at the same time no@@ stal@@ g@@ ically because of the glori@@ ous days of the characters of the 80 @-@ s , for the 90 @-@ s @-@ Gr@@ unge era ( as the Vor@@ den@@ ker David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ age , for 2001 , like Elizabeth Banks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d to bigger things . &quot;
as a cultural arti@@ fact it is equally a par@@ ody and a em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
&quot; but as fran@@ chise , it feels like being around . &quot;
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surpris@@ ingly good , not just because of his ab@@ sur@@ d hum@@ our ( it contained a original story for a speaking of vegetables , which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by focusing on the core of the g@@ ags - actor middle ages have been playing g@@ rop@@ es children who are awak@@ ened , nevertheless they are the impos@@ sibility to win the last part of the v@@ itz@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; ten Years later , &quot; with his adults who play now adults , is less emotional rej@@ ected and his par@@ ody goes more after the range of the stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ s like &quot; The Hand That Rocks the Cra@@ dle &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on a point coll@@ ects a character by an Apple @-@ Power@@ Book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from the year 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the gr@@ acious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ old ) , now novel@@ ist , has K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) still not forgotten . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has not yet been lost its vir@@ ility .
&quot; and there is another crazy @-@ b@@ ign@@ ant plot , in the Ronald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ age ) , which is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well done impression of Michael Ian Black ) . &quot;
as always the courses is the best part of fran@@ chise .
&quot; it is especially fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Rud@@ d , the Matt D@@ ill@@ ons under@@ li@@ pp@@ in art of &quot; Sing@@ les &quot; shows , whose former big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy . &quot;
&quot; there are the moments to random mad@@ ness that could be seen this fran@@ chise , as such as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Twenty Years later , &quot; whose last scene is to visit the Ban@@ de , how to visit the Fil@@ mp@@ re@@ mi@@ ere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon now remember a different kind of no@@ stal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans &quot; , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Blon@@ de &quot; and even &quot; G@@ low &quot; with its East @-@ against @-@ West E@@ vil @-@ I@@ con@@ ography . &quot;

there are some beautiful g@@ ags to see ( the police will bring the time to watch chess on TV as Americans might do with football ) .
&quot; and the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Sl@@ ate , Nick offer@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ora Sev@@ ign@@ y - ensures a decent play &apos; Find the voice &apos; . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is committed so much for the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a glori@@ fied pro@@ paganda plan - a mur@@ derer that contributes to a Re@@ ag@@ an m@@ ask , is that it often plays as one single . &quot;

the message for the Imag@@ er communist audience is that the Western culture can make all the feed for a money .
the fic@@ tional Romanian creator does not lay wrong : we can even make it with our own younger story and with the ih@@ ood .
blow to drugs @-@ Maf@@ ia in the country
police is a blow against the Italian Maf@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; at the end of the morning , in the Black @-@ B@@ aar @-@ circle , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart numerous objects looks through , like the Prosec@@ ut@@ or Con@@ stance on Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; at the age of 25 , 15 were arrested for the age of 25 years and 77 years and already adhesi@@ on to these fa@@ ils . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the officials put larger amounts of marijuana and co@@ conut , Sch@@ uss@@ el as well as several hundred thousand euros . &quot;
at the time of the same Raz@@ ors in Italy were arrested for two persons .
against the two sus@@ pic@@ ion Itali@@ ans there were German dis@@ claimer .
the two will therefore probably be delivered to Germany .
at the action we were involved Italian and Bav@@ arian Er@@ sign@@ ators .
&quot; overall , more than 300 polic@@ emen in operation . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Maf@@ ia will be organised drug , severe non @-@ violence , Q@@ D Mor@@ d as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and comp@@ ression . &quot;
&quot; already since summer 2016 , the Prosec@@ ut@@ or has been identified in the southern German area for summer 2016 . &quot;
between the Prosec@@ ut@@ or in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo were a rain@@ er exchange and the investig@@ ators of the kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily .
&quot; therefore , the majority of the vote in the morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo . &quot;
ins the investigation of the investig@@ ations carried out primarily Italian government with respect to the Italian Maf@@ ia .
&quot; a inci@@ dent on May 27 in Hü@@ b@@ ingen , at which early in the morning several shots were pic@@ ked up into a Gast@@ sta@@ che , is likely to go to the account of the Ban@@ de . &quot;

the lead to di@@ amet@@ ral mal@@ ign@@ ations at as@@ yl@@ um procedures .
&quot; the advoc@@ acy for the re@@ fuge@@ e management of the federal government , Frank @-@ Jürgen speaking , has made a media report to large g@@ aps in the foreign @-@ line register . &quot;
&quot; short@@ com@@ ings in the data registered with as@@ yl@@ um procedures and deport@@ ations &quot; lead to partly graph@@ ically short@@ com@@ ings , war@@ ned in an analysis that the &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the register the information has collected ten million people with foreign nation@@ ality , including about 5,@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU states . &quot;
the data will be managed according to about 600 outputs in Germany .
&quot; because the data was not suffici@@ ently maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases the data of 1921 have been found , &quot; &quot; by people who have long been no longer in life , or by citizens , the German citizen , and in the register are no longer able to arise . &quot;
&quot; faul@@ ty data can be attri@@ buted to recur@@ ring , it means the report to further . &quot;
&quot; in the statistics of standardi@@ zed people were cap@@ tured over@@ this EU citizens , who would not have to travel . &quot;
&quot; but such an incor@@ rect assign@@ ments , but result@@ ed in a dist@@ orted debate on dealing with out@@ lets , &quot; says it dem@@ arc@@ ation in the analysis . &quot;
meanwhile the federal government has apparently begun to return re@@ fuge@@ e families with children under 16 years of children when they trav@@ elled from there under 16 years of age .
&quot; that occurs from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and refugees ( BA@@ MF ) , the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ re Zeitung reports . &quot;
&quot; in the paper it is to be called &quot; &quot; BA@@ MF &quot; &quot; for families with children - except for inf@@ ants and inf@@ ants - according to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation on site . &quot;
&quot; according to Dublin agreement is responsible for refugees in the EU state , which they are first accompl@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; if an imm@@ ig@@ rant to another EU country , this state can send it into the one @-@ ri@@ descent . &quot;
&quot; for the reason this ministry is now : &quot; &quot; now the recording capacity for families with inf@@ eri@@ or@@ age children increased substantially in Italy . &quot;
I have given Italy for inclusion and accommodation of families warran@@ ties .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( E@@ GM@@ R ) keep these addi@@ tives for sufficient .
other EU states would also return to refugees in the context of Dublin @-@ Agreement .
&quot; the interior political inter@@ play in the Bun@@ destag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , cri@@ tici@@ zed this decision : &quot; families with children dro@@ pped because of the def@@ ects in the Italian as@@ yl@@ um system and a haz@@ ard of child care . &quot;

the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.4 %
the Bank of England is expected to be announced later that the interest rates remain un@@ changed after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation is ste@@ amed over an increase .
the Bank of England has war@@ ned that economic growth &quot; will remain &quot; when they re@@ tained the interest rates in the midst of an increased pressure .
&quot; the political decision makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 for the interest rates on 0,@@ 25 % , whereby in this month fewer members give a rise , as the weak economic growth has increased for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in their four @-@ annual report @-@ report decre@@ ased the Bank of its growth rate for 2017 to 1,@@ 7 % and for 2018 , while the pressure would continue to continue the household in the autumn , with the inflation in the autumn is expected to rise to nearly 3 % . &quot;
&quot; but they sign@@ all@@ ing that in the next few years Z@@ adver@@ se would be necessary to grow out of Bre@@ x@@ it , and she said that the credit cost might rise more than expected to the financial markets . &quot;
members agreed also to withdraw from a part of the Mam@@ mut @-@ subj@@ unc@@ tive package that was published before one year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
&quot; it will demand time for financing funds to provide from next February endor@@ g@@ ere funds for banks , although said that it is expected to provide 15 billion po@@ unds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion panc@@ akes and ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; after the decision on the interest below the bank said the bank : &quot; in the central pre@@ diction of the M@@ PC remains the bro@@ od @-@ term product ( B@@ IP ) at short notice , since the pressure on the real beginning of the househ@@ olds can continue the consumption . &quot;
&quot; for the interest rates , it noted that &quot; &quot; a certain pun@@ ishment of monetary policy is necessary for cooling , inflation and a &quot; slightly larger &quot; extent necessary than the markets expect . &quot;
the markets pro@@ gn@@ os@@ ish the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; however , the bank st@@ ressed however , that enh@@ anc@@ ements are gradu@@ al &quot; and &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; further growth of the bank for this and next year will be compared to those in May of pro@@ gn@@ os@@ ti@@ ate 1,@@ 9 % and 1,@@ 7 % . &quot;
it has re@@ tained its growth of growth to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the path fell after these messages in front of the dollar and the euro .
the feet fell by 0.5 % to 1,@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0,@@ 4 % to 1,@@ 11 euros . &quot;
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ appo@@ inting growth have increased the rising expectations on a number of interest in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
&quot; growth will be expected to recover in the third quarter at 0.3 % , although it is easily recover after the bank at the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the most recent in@@ fl@@ ation report offered little enthusiasm for househ@@ olds , which is affected by an increasing inflation and low@@ ed sal@@ aries , as the intensi@@ fication first becomes even worse , before they get better . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy can not be prev@@ ented in the coming years in the coming years , but she added that w@@ ages will be clear to the end of their three @-@ year pro@@ gn@@ osis . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak po@@ unds , resulting in a part of the lower consumption . &quot;
the decision comes from a year after the reduction of interest rates on 0.7 % in the last of August after the sho@@ cking EU vote that condem@@ n the sin@@ ks of a friend .
the bank estimates that it is probably four years to reach the prices and the economy .
&quot; before the last judgment of the Bank to the Z@@ ins@@ ult , the inflation was increased after a cement househ@@ olds , whereas three political decision makers in July take a rise to 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; inflation is reduced last month from 2.7 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the bank said that this was expected and come back in the coming months . &quot;
the bank said that crossing the relation to their destination of 2 % be &quot; completely &quot; weak po@@ unds .
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , director at Cor@@ eco Mort@@ on Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; given the short@@ coming back of S@@ wap at@@ titu@@ des , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be highly competitive , since the credit @-@ len@@ ders are looking forward to stores and end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market looks particularly well for those who run the existing de@@ as and the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot;
&quot; NH@@ S ( The national health service ) is supposed to be able to prescri@@ be HIV @-@ drug 10,000 people &quot;
patients will come from September after a struggle in front of the High Court against financing of the medication in NH@@ S access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV premis@@ e treatment .
&quot; NH@@ S England were announced that one before the intercourse proce@@ eds pre@@ ex@@ position pre@@ ex@@ positions ( pre@@ p ) that can decrease the inf@@ ecting risk of around 86 percent , now from health service to estimated 10,000 people is delivered to estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
he explained to finance the process after being a judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice that the NH@@ S had to pay the authority for the pre@@ p despite the asser@@ tion that local authorities should finance him .
&quot; which was announced on Thursday , by NH@@ S England @-@ Chief of Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an important new intervention . &quot; &quot; during the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) this was marked as the &quot; crucial moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bright@@ on , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be able to allow the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in April 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ ex@@ position sp@@ rop@@ hy@@ lax@@ e ( pre@@ p ) is a consequence of HIV treatment that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of an HIV infection .
Studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission with Inf@@ ection @-@ end@@ anger@@ ed significantly .
pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that straight enough medicines in the body of a person are available to prevent an HIV infection .
such drugs can be taken every day or so two hours before intercourse .
&quot; to those those who are coming to the treatment are pregnant or bis@@ exual men , tran@@ ss@@ exual and persons with HIV @-@ positive partners who have not been successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; in clinics are identified to identify the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status will not be controlled by anti @-@ retro@@ vi@@ ral treatment . &quot;
&quot; people who live in England and join a pet , can also apply to a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic . &quot;
the program is signed £ 10 million and NH@@ S England signed a contract to supply drugs during this week after an international competitive pro@@ curement .
&quot; the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by clinical tri@@ bal , as well as being used in a large scale . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should complement the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts on prevention of HIV and over@@ hau@@ l .
it is another mil@@ estone in the more than three decades ongoing progress in dealing with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , when it is targeted at needs and end@@ anger@@ ed people , the opportunity to change the English epid@@ emic . &quot;
&quot; from September to people , people with high HIV risk access to this NH@@ S @-@ finan@@ ci@@ ally try to develop a new instrument which is really individually controlled and not with a trial with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , CEO of the terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; priority has to be done quickly throughout the country and that no one who has left a risk for HIV . &quot;
&quot; now , as the pre@@ p test@@ inal medicine has been created , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected persons . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Hod@@ g@@ son , sh@@ adows @-@ health Minister , said : &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is appreciated after monthly delay and delay implementation by the government and over@@ due . &quot;
&quot; the evidence point , how does this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention , and the transfer of this life @-@ changing infection can finish . &quot;
this attempt to bring us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study is done as quickly as possible in the whole country to protect people who are HIV suffer@@ ers , and that they will contribute to the end of the dis@@ semination of HIV in society a step closer . &quot;
the big life live : me@@ zz@@ an@@ ine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment in a generous home .
Jo@@ anne L@@ eigh a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , reduced in 2014 by a big house in K@@ nights@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment . &quot;
&quot; it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design , that Jo@@ anne not packed her bags and sold . &quot;
&quot; before , I lived with my ex in K@@ nights@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; I sought after something , that was comparable to my price . &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and she had the same high ceil@@ ings .
I lo@@ ves me in them and made this day an offer . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit the 1,000 square feet tall apartment has been completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
originally a one @-@ room property with a dirty layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to use Jo@@ anne St@@ aur@@ aum and a me@@ zz@@ an@@ ine to make the spacious ceil@@ ing height optim@@ ally .
&quot; I wanted a high ceil@@ ings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; this was my request , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , they commissioned the Archit@@ ec@@ tural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill , which was 12.5 feet high ceil@@ ings and a home to create , not only a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the blank@@ et was not big enough to place two rooms , so that the archit@@ ect@@ onic challenge is insi@@ sted to create a me@@ zz@@ an@@ ine in which one could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to think creative to solve the task .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; explained . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the spaces so easily , that they were over@@ flowing with each other , without having had to g@@ aps . &quot;
&quot; it was not just about to build a simple platform , but the steel that he had the right height for the function or down the right height . &quot;
this arrangement allowed the Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full altitude - with a lot of extra drama .
for the me@@ zz@@ an@@ ine looks a classic copper @-@ light window of ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us via the gl@@ amor@@ ous design .
&quot; embro@@ ider@@ y Gold@@ maker , sil@@ ber@@ ne Ak@@ z@@ ente and Vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille &apos;s ill@@ umination set the style for the program . &quot;
the use of mirr@@ ors plays a role in addition to theatre , space and light . &quot;
both ends to both ends is a short cor@@ rid@@ or se@@ aled to make him longer .
in the kitchen the mirror feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance we offer a pi@@ per unit room for all bri@@ cks and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
&quot; due to the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can shut the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ d@@ able kit@@ chens are nothing new .
what is special about this is that it is a guarant@@ or .

&quot; it is opposite , so it is when you slide the door high slide , very easily gli@@ des . &quot;
thanks to the cle@@ ver@@ ing use of space and storage space could win extra 16 m ² to extra bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the property , or how your property is appreciated , &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;

&quot; here they have managed to enlarge the floor space , and at the same time use high quality materials used to get to the room its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things that they touch and that can therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you do not love yourself into the electrical so@@ ckets in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself by good design and increased square met@@ ab@@ by of something by default into something totally amazing .
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave these not . &quot;
brothers are fighting for a 500 million US dollars of real estate
&quot; two brothers are four decades , after their Italian family founded the Dyn@@ astie , founded in an examination of one of the largest real estate of Vic@@ tori@@ an in the value of more than 500 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; the former Director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football @-@ Club &apos; and developers Colin De Lu@@ tis is living in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his j@@ unc@@ tive brother Paul , to clari@@ fy him as their property and business . &quot;
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 but a sharp examination of the separation occurs in the Supreme Court of Justice .
&quot; together with her mother Anna possess the brothers 38 properties in the value of more than half billion dollars , since the family since 1973 saw a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
there &apos;s family West@@ co je@@ ans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores .
there was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
&quot; this money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now includes offices in Stad@@ tz@@ en@@ rum , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler and shopping centres in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; after an agreement with its dec@@ eased , Colin - from Paul as &quot; &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; &quot; described in the family De Lu@@ tis - about two thir@@ ds of business activity and Paul about one third . &quot;
&quot; a jurisdiction that this means that Colin possession in the value of 316 million dollars and Paul has a value of 176 million dollars . &quot;
the division of real estate and cash has turned out for Paul as a pro@@ bing point .
&quot; those of Colin proposed up@@ bringing have left him with the left that I kept for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first step . &quot;
last Friday took place the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice .
the brothers are now strug@@ gling to control over the existing business - of which Paul says that Paul is excluded .
&quot; Colin ar@@ gues , this is not true , but thro@@ ws Paul before , some pos@@ sessions of in@@ compet@@ ently . &quot;
&quot; in an early Aff@@ id@@ av@@ it , which was submitted by Colin , he says he hope to give the disp@@ ute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage writes , that the family is the most important priority , he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cost increase in the case , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , em@@ ails and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and charter K@@ eck C@@ ram@@ er , and with leading law@@ yer , including All@@ an My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides . &quot;
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her dec@@ eased Luigi were Italian imm@@ ig@@ rants who run the milk and del@@ icacy from the late 1950 @-@ s and in the early se@@ ven@@ ties a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick .
they took the safety to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood lifts in the Colin family opened the family .
&quot; Colin says that he began on West@@ co , when he was in High School in my last years , when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hopes to pass their property to their sons . &quot;
Luigi said often to me that he never wanted to land the brethren before judgment .
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group , with Colin claims that Mark when leaving the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark be , Paul &quot; &quot; says Paul &quot; on the terms of their financial separation . &quot;
Colin has been very with@@ held even though he was a former AF@@ L project member and after a biography from the year 2015 by Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the television stars .
Fair@@ fax Media took place with Colin and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their attor@@ neys .
&quot; only Colin answered by SMS to say &quot; I can really not say much , &quot; because the case before the courts was . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to compla@@ in me and our sur@@ names by the courts , &quot; wrote . &quot;
&quot; mid 2016 , Colin in a letter to the court that he tried to meet the demands of his brother . &quot;
&quot; our father could not be aware that Paul and I would not , in our current conflict , he said and added that he is still working on a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope he seemed to be over .
&quot; our matter will be resolved in the near future of the courts , &quot; wrote Colin . &quot;
Tru@@ mps new Stab@@ sch@@ ef is planning to rest@@ rict the media @-@ ab@@ stin@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and are failed .
maybe John F. Kelly is actually doing .
&quot; if yes , he will be the first one . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico reported that the new Stab@@ sch@@ ef of the White House is planning to rest@@ rict the information flow to President Tru@@ mp , including the reports of the news media - in the hope to hold the chef on a uniform course . &quot;
here is a piece of repor@@ ter Jos@@ h Daw@@ sey :
&quot; as John F. Kelly , the new Stab@@ sch@@ ef of the White House , at his first working day , he set a major problem in President Donald Tru@@ mps white house , which he rep@@ aired us : bad information that is used in the hands of the President . &quot;
&quot; Kelly said the staff that information should flow about him - whether on paper or in letter , because the President would make better choices when he would get good information . &quot;
&quot; cell@@ ars diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to tell Tru@@ mp by constantly monitor his media . &quot;
&quot; President Tru@@ mps relation to TV reaches decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television image is still strong . &quot;
&quot; when Candi@@ date Tru@@ mp was angry because of a fair coverage , it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of places who were to convince , &quot; said the former election of Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; the key , Tru@@ mps Twitter @-@ hab@@ it exists under control , according to six former elect@@ oral officials to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a ste@@ ady praise . &quot;
okay .
&quot; but the idea that Tru@@ mps Twitter @-@ hab@@ it ever &quot; under control &quot; was , is ri@@ dic@@ ulous . &quot;
perhaps these campaigns shall know something that we do not know others - that Tru@@ mps Twe@@ ets have no longer share without their inter@@ ventions .
we will probably learn something about the Twe@@ ets the Tru@@ mp has not been sent .
&quot; when he made his staff a couple of times a few times , anger from him , then their efforts was worth@@ while . &quot;
nobody has consistently prevent it consequently that Tru@@ mp controls .
&quot; part of the problem is that people in a white house that sets themselves up from competitive parties , constantly trying to present their own agenda by promoting Tru@@ mp material , which may help their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico - very busy with this history - reported in May about the pre@@ ference of the consultants , the President of strategic reasons to be attri@@ buted to the president . &quot;
this was an example that was described by repor@@ ter Shane Gold@@ maker :
&quot; current and former Tru@@ mp officials say that Tru@@ mp as a volcano is able to react to a negative freedom of press , especially such with cor@@ rupted Lec@@ co , and that he fell as@@ leep . &quot;
&quot; exactly that came to pass at the end of February , when som@@ eb@@ ody came to the president of Got@@ New@@ s.com , the website of the internet @-@ pro@@ voc@@ at@@ eur@@ s Charles C. Johnson , who were the Deputy @-@ sch@@ ef@@ in K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the Source behind a he@@ ap of Lec@@ co &quot; in the White House . &quot;
though Johnson was founded on Twitter because of su@@ ik@@ ans permanently removed from Twitter or that he has no concrete proof or that he has expressed false proposals in the past .
Tru@@ mp read the article and started to deal with staff about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ maker added that the then Stab@@ sch@@ ef Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Porter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage the pap@@ er@@ m and to document the Tru@@ mp . &quot;
how has the folded ?
Kelly se@@ eks three months later to do the same .
&quot; maybe he will prove to be more effective manager as pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his impul@@ si@@ ves self , and his consultants are still looking for influence . &quot;
these un@@ changing factors make wa@@ it@@ ys mission very difficult .
chis@@ els get the post of Euro@@ pol

&quot; the experiences would have been shown that many vol@@ ati@@ es hide @-@ up of holiday , was made by Euro@@ pol . &quot;
I have compiled 21 post@@ cards for search@@ ed cri@@ minals from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 , the website has been re@@ viewed once more than 2.5 million times this has been viewed . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online convers@@ ations could have previously been arrested , at least eleven thereof due to instructions on the website . &quot;
trav@@ ellers negoti@@ ate on a dit@@ ch and return back to &apos; milli@@ on@@ ary @-@ series &apos; .
&quot; some of the we@@ alth@@ y land@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are again negoti@@ ated with some resol@@ ute travelers in the war@@ ef@@ oot , who sold one of the community pul@@ led dit@@ ch in order to re@@ claim a field in front of their man@@ or houses . &quot;
the trav@@ ellers have a 20 caravan in a field outside of a prosper@@ ous road from Soli@@ h@@ ull that is called the &quot; milli@@ on@@ är@@ s series . &quot;
&quot; they have brought horses , babies and a army of transport@@ cases , after they have been thro@@ wn out only in May , but by one of the Council bur@@ den@@ ed dit@@ ch to prevent their acci@@ dents . &quot;
the tac@@ tile group found a gap in the def@@ ences and depres@@ sed their vehicles in a section that remained un@@ resolved to find a way .
&quot; angry residents have completed the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it was &quot; us@@ eless &quot; to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous residents said , &quot; You are drawn on Monday night after they have been sent out by Bentley He@@ ath where they cast stones on the p@@ asser@@ by . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced by shame on the implementation into reality , as he was us@@ eless in dealing with the problem . &quot;
the trav@@ ellers were there in May there were further moved and are now back again .
&quot; more arrived yesterday evening , probably still more . &quot;
she added : &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by keeping a long under@@ taken to protect their parks .
&quot; I live at the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to pay my common to pay , if the Council cannot stop it once . &quot;
&quot; a mo@@ ist who did not want to be called said , &quot; &quot; It is ri@@ dic@@ ulous , we just have seen the last lap of this trav@@ eller , just to pl@@ under@@ min@@ es by another round . &quot;
the figures have raised this time and you can even see a horse in the park .
speaking in the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorized camp on the land beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to pass it as soon as possible .
&quot; in order to support our Be@@ ading , it is very important that as possible as many occasions as a anti @-@ social or cri@@ minal behavior in the police by calling 101 . &quot;
&quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the judgment must check , when we present our case . &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof is the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house before the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts is currently being renovated and should be opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; for the closing of the hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the then ambience of the hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof , by the then 13th of April 2014 , approximately 30 000 nights per year lost per year and also revenue by the city tax . &quot;
&quot; in autumn of 2014 dram@@ atic rising numbers of refugees who came into the district of the district , the hotel building of the district , which is offered for contro@@ versi@@ al discussions . &quot;
the city prev@@ ented the accommodation of as@@ yl@@ um seek@@ ers through the list of an investment plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ contro@@ versi@@ al at that time .
&quot; but above all Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts Ober@@ ci@@ wald Julian O@@ ss@@ wald def@@ ends the hotel location , and spoke at that time by serious stak@@ eholders in the house . &quot;
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with its headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof in a voluntary au@@ ction of Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of three @-@ star @-@ Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object Four homes .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; you are looking for Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ is@@ en@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the former hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof have been standing in front of the entrance before the entrance , and when you entered the house it becomes clear , what extensive renovation work will be made . &quot;
&quot; the vessels have been removed from the rooms , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
until March there is still much to do .
&quot; it is actually a lovely place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything is supposed to be renewed in the Black @-@ style .
&quot; the rooms are fitted with large woo@@ ded showers , the entrance range is inver@@ ted , the new window will be installed . &quot;
&quot; everything sol@@ le later &quot; &quot; be stra@@ yed , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer expressed . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a jewel @-@ piece , &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are among facilities . &quot;
&quot; one wants to be positioned not at the high level of the hotels in a lu@@ ter@@ steam bath , but already on a up@@ scale city level . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms , to set up wide , explains Sch@@ erer . &quot;
both individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men will feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; convers@@ ations with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tour@@ ne@@ tor Michael Kr@@ ause he has already led , so scar@@ erer . &quot;
the ideas of the city be covered with those of the Hotel Group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; after the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer is not able to set itself exactly . &quot;
&quot; just under a million Euro , he expects . &quot;
&quot; even the outdoor facilities are brought to ob@@ mann , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a patio arises a large terrace , which is accessible from the restaurant , which is public@@ ly accessible . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Mon@@ es : us @-@ Special deals with Grand Jury
in the Russia aff@@ air to U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp is intended to have speci@@ alised in Robert Mu@@ eller after a report a so called Grand Jury .
&quot; the Advisory Board recorded the work in the past weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; under calling for familiar persons . &quot;
the newspaper value the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded its investig@@ ations and intensi@@ fied .
the Sender CN@@ N reported it was already the first pre @-@ lad@@ der of the Gre@@ mi@@ um in connection with a meeting between Tru@@ mps and a Russian law@@ yer .
&quot; U.S. intelligence has been ad@@ mitted to the Kre@@ m@@ ish , targeted to the pres@@ idential elections in 2016 . &quot;
Mu@@ eller investig@@ ated whether there was the agreement between Tru@@ mps Wahl@@ kamp@@ ft@@ e@@ am and Moscow .
the focus of investig@@ ations should be several men that are in the election campaign as a consultant of the Republi@@ c@@ ers .
&quot; report , Mu@@ eller also took more and more tru@@ mps priv@@ ates and business environment under the micro@@ scope . &quot;
&quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special mitt@@ ent Tru@@ mp personally put into the center and under@@ stands the design , whether the President in the wake of the aff@@ air could possibly dis@@ solved the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys , it is to consider the present evidence of possible inter@@ rup@@ tions and decide whether ac@@ cus@@ ation is collected . &quot;
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called ac@@ cus@@ ations .
&quot; mostly they are on , when it comes to greater and contro@@ vers@@ y cases . &quot;
the procedure is always behind ver@@ ted doors .
the panel may also be enabled by the Prosec@@ ution and to make persons for the con@@ ce@@ aling under E@@ id .
according to the sender CN@@ N were already issued pre@@ lad@@ ders that turn around the meeting between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ r. and a Russian law@@ yer .
&quot; persons who were involved in the meeting , were introduced to a statement , was called it in the report . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , they should provide documents . &quot;
besides Tru@@ mp J@@ r. also Tru@@ mps consultants and son @-@ law Jar@@ ed Kus@@ hn@@ er as well as his former treas@@ ury Paul Man@@ a@@ fort in conversation .
&quot; legal experts said on Thursday , Thurs@@ day@@ us in the US @-@ TV , that the replacement show that Mu@@ eller may not let themselves sh@@ y in his work and that he should be necessary to act quickly . &quot;
but it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned in the end to decide on the collection of an indic@@ t@@ ment .
&quot; however , the en@@ forcement of the Gre@@ mi@@ ths of the beginning of a new phase in the investig@@ ations and a new reason for concern for President Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the new revel@@ ations , the President will publish a speech in West Virginia , to present the Russia aff@@ air as the campaign of his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total in@@ vention , &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; the topic give the democr@@ ats a way to feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about that they can talk . &quot;
his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in a statement that he does not know anything from the imm@@ en@@ forcement of a Grand Jury .
&quot; but this work is also usually in the en@@ vy , he st@@ ressed . &quot;
&quot; the white house advoc@@ ates any measures , which acceler@@ ated the work of the special , &quot; &quot; fair &quot; way . &quot; &quot;
the former F@@ BI leader James Com@@ ey did not say three times that not against the president .
&quot; one has no reason to assume that something has changed , it was in the explanation . &quot;
&quot; but Mu@@ eller was only used , after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey found . &quot;
&quot; because of this r@@ aus@@ es were ac@@ cus@@ hion against Tru@@ mp , he said the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June in front of a Sen@@ ats@@ u Committee , Tru@@ mp raised him to a setting of investig@@ ations against the then national security advis@@ ors Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot;
the president stands for the examination under large pressure .
according to the representation of US @-@ media gathered the white house material against the special medi@@ ator and its employees .
the dis@@ solved spec@@ ulation about whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller .
&quot; different from an independent special report , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate Aff@@ air to the later rep@@ aired president Richard Ni@@ x@@ on , has Mu@@ eller a position in which he can be found theore@@ tically to pres@@ ses of the President of the President of Justice . &quot;
several Sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
&quot; two groups of republi@@ can and democratic transm@@ issions stood on Thursday Leg@@ alities , after which the speci@@ men could no longer be released . &quot;
Antarctica : Gig@@ antic Ic@@ ef@@ ist in the Antarc@@ tic
in the West@@ ern@@ ark@@ tis has resolved a gig@@ antic Eis@@ berg from the barely @-@ fold size of Berlin from Schel@@ dt .
the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener @-@ Institut for Polar@@ - and seafood on Wednesday with .
&quot; over a Bil@@ lion ton heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers , large pist@@ oss t@@ aps now after north and become probably two , three years until he mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; it is with 175 kilometers of length and width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the biggest ice gl@@ ers , the researchers have registered over the past three decades . &quot;
a danger for people is not going out of him .
&quot; in@@ wi@@ ew@@ eit the climate change played a role in the break@@ through of the ic@@ eberg , is un@@ clear to research . &quot;
&quot; however , it has been a series of unusual compositions of iron in the region , writes the US research centre for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a single background . &quot;
according to many researchers this could be related to war@@ ming .
the Kol@@ oss has so far been part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ dt .
Schel@@ dt flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by big gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ dt is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarc@@ tic peninsula .
North of this Schel@@ dt was the balance of wax@@ es and vom@@ iting a few years ago .
a complete hor@@ ses@@ hoe be there , writes AW@@ I @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; there is some things that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ fei@@ s are in danger , for the fore K@@ ante have never moved so far as at present . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ic@@ eboard under voltage and could dis@@ integrate , if at a key@@ pad is a piece of down@@ side . &quot;
the mel@@ ting of Schel@@ dt and Eis@@ berg does not increase the sea level since they swim in the water and ice so much water as it gives after the mel@@ ting itself .
&quot; however , the loss of Schel@@ dt leads to that the gl@@ aci@@ ers can go directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in the less@@ er dimensions , writes the British research project to observation of Antarctica ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ fei@@ s is according to AW@@ I @-@ information with nearly 50 000 square kilometres .
&quot; at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , on the front@@ side to the free ocean is around 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks down regularly .
&quot; although there is a natural appearance and we have no direct connection to climate change , the ice is now in a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ Le@@ ary from British Sw@@ an@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the wid@@ est re@@ treat since the beginning of the record , &quot; confirmed it . &quot;
&quot; scientists be contro@@ versi@@ al , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ dt will now grow again and possibly together , his colle@@ ague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
&quot; even though these researchers will not lead the quar@@ ry of this gig@@ antic Ic@@ eberg in the climate change , so we have dro@@ pped a lot in the last few decades to the ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula . &quot;
this long finish of the Antarc@@ tic extends the direction of South America .
after data of the research programmes British Antarc@@ tic Sur@@ vey is the Iron @-@ surface of the Antarc@@ tic peninsula since the 19@@ 50s of 28 000 square kilometers .
the decl@@ ine have contributed to the decl@@ ine .
&quot; the Antarctica was raised over 50 years by approximately three degrees and count towards the areas where the temperature at the fast@@ est sti@@ ff . &quot;
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
&quot; because it becomes more and more difficult to occup@@ y freely alter@@ ed places , the CD@@ U calls out from the employer association to become more attractive . &quot;
only shortly before the summer of the day@@ break there were 41 new places in administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the rotor in M@@ ett@@ mann .
&quot; now , 17 tra@@ inees have been behind her first work@@ day . &quot;
the teach@@ es at the circle are clearly very popular .
around 620 cri@@ es were to be ordered for the places in this year .
yet the circle is lack@@ ing the personnel to cope with the sc@@ ended requirements and tasks .
&quot; currently , there are still 50 un@@ occupied areas at the circle of M@@ ett@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; sought , among other doctors and engine@@ ers , as well as forces of general administration . &quot;
the CD@@ U would like to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG Initiative and the U@@ WG Initiative .
the management is intended to work according to the desire of the parties &quot; a concept for rec@@ orders and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to cover not only in short term printing , but future @-@ oriented of the applic@@ ants , is called it . &quot;
&quot; the concept should be based on inside and outside , concrete measures for cross @-@ cli@@ m@@ bers and involve a training @-@ level sive measures , challenge CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
this already listen to a good approach .
&quot; for the circle it has to do with staff issues , which one could not know earlier . &quot;
other cities adver@@ tise good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions .
we are talking about a regular &quot; competition of public employers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a high number of employees , the disease or age may fail from the service . &quot;
&quot; so high time for action so , so that no more places remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; Klaus @-@ Dieter Müller , leader of the CD@@ U , talks with his party through the joint request . &quot;
he has long been asked for a fine @-@ time for a fat @-@ day surprise when he placed the personnel involved in the question and the rest of the parties int@@ rigu@@ ed .
&quot; people want to veri@@ fy that all the options are checked , which enable a res@@ ign@@ ation from the municip@@ al employer association . &quot;
&quot; if we are not going to come about a satis@@ fying solution , the cra@@ w@@ ages with trade unions - maybe even in cooperation with the circular cities - an Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f stri@@ ve &quot; &quot; so peoples . &quot;
&quot; with this , the CD@@ U , employees and officials find better to pay when there is a cost @-@ facing for the Public Service actually . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently exactly pre@@ prescribed , enh@@ anc@@ ements or more money is only if you change in a higher level , which is oriented to a professional years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle have always grown more and more .

Italy spar@@ ed the tone to NGO imm@@ ig@@ rants
&quot; Italy has NGOs to use the lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean Sea , war@@ ned that they may not continue , if they are not allowed to hold new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs does not write a new Code of Conduc@@ t , it is difficult to see how they can continue in an interview with the Tur@@ iner Daily News La Stamp@@ a . &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis was a day after the Italian authorities had a boat of the German workers &apos; youth b@@ ail@@ et &apos; youth b@@ ail@@ ed &apos; because their team had worked effectively with man @-@ hang@@ ers in a way that facilit@@ ates illegal imm@@ igration .
&quot; the aid @-@ organisation that has only been operating in operation since a year , it has become an exec@@ ute of the Italian state of the Italian state of Amb@@ ro@@ gio Cart@@ osi@@ o . &quot;
&quot; for us and remains the res@@ cue of human life our top priority . it therefore does so sorry , that we can operate at the moment in the search and res@@ our@@ able zone , &quot; &quot; said the organization in an opinion to social media . &quot;
&quot; we can all alleg@@ ations that are currently being collected , after we have collected all the information and can judge the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had the boat of &apos; youth Rett@@ et &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , has been monitor@@ ed since October . &quot;
&quot; it is thought that his crew is ding@@ hy @-@ migrants at board , which can be delivered directly from human tra@@ ders , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gler can be used so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such co@@ incidence , only 1,3 miles before the Liby@@ an coast took place , according to the ac@@ te of the Prosec@@ ut@@ or , whose content was published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the occupation will be dou@@ bled upon the authority of the Italian coast@@ line , the lif@@ ebo@@ ats in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not from any other moti@@ fs . &quot;
under the Code of Conduc@@ t boats like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a have to have a Italian police station on board who super@@ vised their activities .
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and res@@ cue operations , have so far been declared to keep the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be un@@ necessary , but acceptable , as they would be no &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; their life@@ jacket with themselves . &quot;
among those who love to sign up is the Nobel Prize @-@ Award of doctors without borders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; Min@@ nit@@ i said that the number of migrants that have gone greatly to the lif@@ ebo@@ arding measures in Italy , in recent weeks , resulting in the efforts to strengthen the Liby@@ an coast@@ line and cooperation with the local bourgeoisie . &quot;
&quot; in the last few days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; he gave plans for further discussions with Liby@@ an bourgeoisie in this month about economic development initi@@ ative and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali over measures to reduce the number of migrants that can reach these countries in the hope of Europe . &quot;

for this there were three @-@ friendly guides .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for tours .
the Burg@@ - and wine festival of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour conducted with hot summer temperatures along the vineyards for the Michael@@ kap@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; it followed view@@ points , partly on towers , of which one could look far beyond the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest and the afor@@ emen@@ tion@@ ed levels . &quot;

&quot; to sit in the sport @-@ stars in the future , instead of pun@@ ched at wind and weather over the stages of stages ? &quot;
&quot; fact : e @-@ sport is long since a serious industry , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high g@@ ages including . &quot;
these have also recognized the first federal state that are increasingly involved in this area .
&quot; the beginning was made in the beginning of 2015 the V@@ f@@ L Wol@@ fs@@ burg , later followed the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last , the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , founded in mid July a E @-@ Sport Department and two professionals for the Computer Game FI@@ FA 17 . &quot;
&quot; we hope to delight a new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says the board of Jochen Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; he is certain , &quot; &quot; that on this train continues to asc@@ end . &quot;
&quot; the coming weekend will organize the football world premiere FI@@ FA in London the first &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; , &quot; where the gam@@ er of various clubs are facing each other . &quot;
&quot; in addition to shell@@ fish and Wol@@ fs@@ burg , for example Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven . &quot;
also Robin Dut@@ t looks great potential in the E @-@ Sport .
the Ex @-@ coach of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now a agency for virtual so@@ ccer player .
&quot; the real football must deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year old , that young people are still going into the stadi@@ um , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the associations , all sorts of markets , especially the Asian , conqu@@ er . &quot;
&quot; with prominent e @-@ ath@@ letes under contract , one could be more present on these markets than once a year the Bundes@@ liga team to Asia . &quot;
what is it exactly ?
&quot; with E @-@ sport , computer games like &quot; &quot; League Of Legends &quot; , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Counter@@ strike &quot; or just the football @-@ simul@@ ate FI@@ FA at competitive level . &quot;
&quot; long , as in normal sport also , sounds established , in which the pro@@ s are facing each other . &quot;
and with the Asi@@ en@@ play 2022 is e @-@ sport already part of the official program .
but is it all about a real sport ?
for many is the performance safe to be used .
Ingo Fro@@ st has long been apart for a long time with the question .
&quot; for the professor at the German Sp@@ orth@@ och@@ schule in Cologne is e @-@ sport a sport , because he is a peti@@ tive and many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sport - for example increased cardi@@ ac disease , stress re@@ productions , hormon@@ al changes . &quot;
&quot; in addition , cogni@@ tive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast response . &quot;
&quot; Professional Gam@@ ers should not only take care of the console , but also their bodies and watch the diet . &quot;
&quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; cold but also problems : &quot; &quot; Dop@@ ing becomes more and more a theme . &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult on online gaming and in the scene lack@@ ed the structures of the classic sport .
&quot; posi@@ tively , the scientists emphas@@ ises the high integ@@ rative effect of the E @-@ Sports . &quot;
&quot; players are international on the road , which is like a big global family , there are no intercultural imp@@ acts . &quot;
a study of the corporate consult@@ ancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the German Association of Interactive Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) tells the e @-@ sport a rapid growth ahead .
&quot; in 2016 , in Germany 50 million euros have been implemented over Germany , mainly about advertising , sponsor@@ ship and great tournaments . &quot;
in three years the turnover should lie at 130 million in three years .
against the nearly 2.4 billion euros of football Bundes@@ liga that is little .
&quot; however , the e @-@ sport &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as Hand@@ ball , basketball or hockey , &quot; write the del@@ o@@ itte @-@ consultants . &quot;
international are many countries already further .
large markets are Asia and the US where the ex @-@ basketball game Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rod@@ rigu@@ ez the US team nr@@ g e@@ Sports participate .
Hollywood @-@ actor As@@ ht@@ on Kut@@ cher is investing in the e@@ Sports Competition .
also in Europe is doing a lot .
&quot; in a Norwegian school , E @-@ Sports has been introduced as a @-@ rot@@ ary , says Fro@@ evil . &quot;
in the Netherlands and in France there are the football @-@ pen@@ gu@@ ese associations according to Dut@@ t is oblig@@ ed to set up an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany is called V@@ f@@ B @-@ Chairman Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; only in no@@ stal@@ gia to fall , and the old times clari@@ fy , is no longer sufficient today . &quot;
&quot; it comes to preserve the tradition of the association , but the company at the same time to set up the modern market . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digit@@ alized world , &quot; says Dut@@ t . &quot;
&quot; however , one can not keep it clear that only in football everything remains as it was always . &quot;

&quot; Michelle Carter because of the lyrics , the Conrad Roy hur@@ ry to su@@ icide . &quot;
a woman from Massachusetts has been sent@@ enced to two and a half years because she encour@@ aged her friend by lyrics and calls for su@@ icide .
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her condem@@ nation behind guitar@@ ists and five years were put on nutrition . &quot;
&quot; Carter was sent@@ enced in June because of a casual pots by Conrad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ comfort@@ ed .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until calling .
&quot; she had been con@@ fron@@ ted with a maximum of 20 years ago , but their law@@ ful arg@@ um@@ pers that both them and Mr Roy has suffered from a psych@@ ic disease . &quot;
&quot; in red pants and a cre@@ amy texture , Carter stood there with t@@ ears in the eyes , with painted hands and down in the eyes , when they were condem@@ ned . &quot;
&quot; their actions have brought by Conrad Roy , &quot; &quot; said the Prosec@@ ut@@ or of the judgment . &quot;
she ended his life to make their own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility taken over , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ ters law@@ yer said , it was a &quot; terrible revol@@ t , which they completely reg@@ ret . &quot;
&quot; but judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , he did not find out that their &quot; age or Rei@@ f@@ eg@@ rad or even their spiritual disease have a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a Prosec@@ ut@@ or read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who poss@@ esses that there is no day where I do not emph@@ asi@@ ze the loss of my beloved Son . &quot;
&quot; I want to be proud of me and how I go with everything . I try , despite all my pain , which we will be for etern@@ ity with us , for his sisters there , is it in it . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ d@@ yn Roy , said that she will never join the knowledge of the knowledge , or would never be able to participate in the wedding of her brother or a t@@ ante for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer this only person to have , with whom I have been together every day since my birth is a pain , which I will always keep for the rest of my life forever . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to put a legal pre@@ judice , as there is no law in Massachusetts where it makes it a crime to re@@ claim another , su@@ icide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy has been found dead in a vehicle &apos;s CO2 emissions in a vehicle .
&quot; the case attracted national attention to themselves , after Car@@ ters noti@@ ons , that they encour@@ ages him to finish his life . &quot;
&quot; hang@@ ing you on the spring of a building , get you yourself , I know not , there are many paths , &quot; she said in several messages that she had sent them into the two weeks before his death , while he was with his family on vacation . &quot;
&quot; in the eye above his self @-@ icide she wrote : &quot; &quot; you have to do it , Conrad &quot; &quot; and &quot; everything you have to do , is the generator turn and you will be free and happy . &quot;
&quot; judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter draws attention by the death of Roy , and ordered that they benefit from any press from the case . &quot;
the case has the legal opinion divided .
&quot; among the few , the Carter def@@ ended , Aman@@ da Kno@@ x that was condem@@ ned in 2007 because of the British room@@ mate in Italy before they were released two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and assistance , not prison . &quot;

&quot; it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the state and regional econom@@ ies , as Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke ( founder ) of the Rhineland @-@ Palatinate . &quot;
this is evident after more than one year in which the new economic minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and businesses from the region speak to T V request from a change in economic policy - and simultaneously the old Minister .
&quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association Tri@@ erer companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing takes the desires of the economy to the Lem@@ ke all@@ es@@ amt . &quot;
the largest revers@@ al sees Nat@@ us in the Infra@@ struc@@ turing : the passage of the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and A@@ den@@ au stands in the priorities of the country well .
&quot; again this year , the ministry is on a planning process , until 2021 it is supposed to stand up the system . &quot;
a role in the plans of the country also plays the western edge of Trier , which stands in the pre@@ urg@@ ent need of the federal road . &quot;

Daim@@ ler announced on Tuesday that there are three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce his diesel emissions .
none of the companies describe the business as a callback .
European automotive manufacturers have encour@@ aged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon di@@ oxide emissions .
&quot; but the nit@@ rogen @-@ oxide , the diesel engines , are regarded as car@@ cin@@ ogens and can cause as@@ thma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of the automotive manufacturers , plants for neutr@@ alization of the engines of diesel vehicles to install , take also to what it makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot;

&quot; they ask the repor@@ ters , names for each column - no evidence is needed , per@@ cep@@ tions and abdom@@ inal cav@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; there are drugs , politicians , politicians , business@@ men , journalists , who are condem@@ ned to stand on the other side of the government or the box , a catalog of bre@@ eders that make the chaos of Mexico . &quot;
&quot; there is no her@@ ds of violence , and while throughout the country the corp@@ ses , are more and more journalists : at least 25 , since President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Ni@@ eto took place in December 2012 . 589 are after att@@ acked and thre@@ ats under federal protection and up now there were at least seven dead in seven states . &quot;
&quot; under the latter , its publisher and inspir@@ ator of Ri@@ od@@ o@@ ce , the co @-@ founder of Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest error is to live in Mexico and will be a journ@@ alist , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence associated with drugs . &quot;
&quot; its absence will be deeply felt , although his presence everywhere is present - a big photo of Val@@ dez , which shows his mid @-@ finger with the word &quot; &quot; Justice &quot; , &quot; hang@@ ing at the fa@@ ç@@ ade of the Ri@@ od@@ o@@ ce building . &quot; two repor@@ ter in the three @-@ three years , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Miriam Ram@@ i@@ rez , wearing T @-@ shirts that have his ri@@ dic@@ ulous face with glasses or its typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop will take place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared subjects , trau@@ ma , their night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although in 2010 it was established an on @-@ government agency to edit the cases of journalists , this is initi@@ ated according to the Committee for journalists only to the protection of journalists only two pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; as with most thousands of Mor@@ den , each year are linked to drug addi@@ tive and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are only rarely provided in court . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ od@@ o@@ ce still , they are still to treat the violence of Sin@@ al@@ oa , although they are un@@ ob@@ serving and although the terrain is now even stronger . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for discussion of safety , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very stup@@ id , my time in this workshop , &quot; says he . &quot;
&quot; as long as we do not know the Why , we mist@@ aken all . &quot;
&quot; in the morning of 15 May , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ od@@ o@@ ce in the provin@@ cial capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he made it only to drive a few blocks , before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was raised by two men . he was taken from his car and 12 times was fin@@ ed to him , probably due to the name of the newspaper - which is translated using &quot; &quot; twelve river &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the p@@ rest went away from his car and damaged it in the vicinity .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ours to be free in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but at Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ mans re@@ ven@@ ge last year and delivery to the United States in January , Sin@@ al@@ oa had become one of the blu@@ tig@@ est batt@@ le@@ ties of the country , since riv@@ eting fr@@ actions are fighting here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it does not make any thing that in Sin@@ al@@ oa every day someone or several people on the street are shot or that the cemetery is full of complicated , two @-@ story Maus@@ ole@@ ums for Dro@@ gen@@ ria , which are bigger than many houses for living . &quot;
&quot; forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; , &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its precious ports and drugs of commercial countries in the United States . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work is Mr. Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ od@@ o@@ ce , with the bl@@ ame that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first , in February the publication of an interview with Dam@@ as@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of ri@@ val@@ ing cart@@ oons in war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have with@@ ered the sons , susp@@ ected hall@@ ways : each copy of the issue , as soon as it has been delivered to time @-@ ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second fault was to force that Val@@ dez did not force , after con@@ fis@@ cation of another newspaper , which had the same story to leave the land to its own security . &quot;
Val@@ dez was a leg@@ end in Mexico and abroad , and his k@@ illing is regarded as a mil@@ estone in the Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had so long survi@@ ved that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .
he was active in 2003 as an experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este when he joined with five colleagues in the creation of Ri@@ od@@ o@@ ce and 50 US dollars .
&quot; in Sin@@ al@@ oa , it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without encounter the pre@@ d@@ ow@@ ry problem , said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; with the time the newspaper earned a reputation because of cour@@ age@@ ous and honest reporting , and revenue and advertising . &quot;
&quot; repor@@ ters loved it to publish hard hel@@ pers with no fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and the readers were int@@ rigu@@ ed from a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else could treat . &quot;
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ od@@ o@@ ce she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for their reporting in Latin America .
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez has won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the committee for the protection of journalists in persecution of Mexican Drug history , wherever it led . &quot;
he was vol@@ un@@ tar@@ ily said that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue to live , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award . &quot;
&quot; Drug trade in Sin@@ al@@ oa &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot;
you must assume the task that falls you as a journ@@ alist - either that or you play the du@@ ms .
&quot; I would not like to be asked : &quot; &quot; what did you do in the face of so many dead ... why have you not told what happened before ? &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ od@@ o@@ ce team will miss Val@@ dez , the Spa@@ et@@ bird , who was like a port workers , the friend , the generous with hug@@ s and advice , a teacher who knew how to survi@@ ved . &quot;
she trusted on his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
&quot; he would always sit down to El Guay@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , go and sit there at the same table . &quot;
&quot; well , ask them : was his love for routine to be st@@ oves ? &quot;
&quot; his death also has to forced them to ask their own assu@@ mp@@ tions about it , how to do their work best and remain in life . &quot;
&quot; they do not like it with their wives , their children , their clean@@ ed shops , her be@@ ad@@ ly start and far@@ ways to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ determination and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
his own inst@@ inc@@ ts trust .
&quot; if it is wrong , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; anger is , said the editor of the Ri@@ od@@ o@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real that &quot; smell is a sense that can be changed ... and then the thing happened to Javier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , in Sin@@ al@@ oa no longer - just like in Tam@@ au@@ li@@ pas , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states , in which a tox@@ ic mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ ly , weak institutions and cor@@ rupt officials . &quot;
the landscape is constantly changing .
&quot; in the room , where the staff of Ri@@ od@@ o@@ ce came to the security training , were suddenly no phones allowed . days before has been known that Spy@@ ware that is exclusively used to governments to monitor journalists and ac@@ tivi@@ sts in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; outside , two polic@@ emen protect against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree . &quot;
they were commissioned by the federal government to protect the offices of Ri@@ od@@ o@@ ce in a four @-@ story area in a mid @-@ class quarter of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; and half in a joke , some of the repor@@ ters , whether these offic@@ ers belong to the 50 percent of polic@@ emen , who belong to the Govern@@ or itself as not trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s months ago since the repor@@ ters went out into the mountain region , where the drug ad@@ ures de fac@@ to under control . &quot;
for the issue of this week Ri@@ od@@ o@@ ce has been stret@@ ched on three main stories .
there was the ass@@ ass@@ ination of the brother of the former known Box@@ ers Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ ve@@ z in Sin@@ al@@ oa .
they also had an exp@@ ose to the ci@@ tiz@@ ens@@ hip that was concentrated on the hom@@ etown of the govern@@ or .
&quot; there was a group that carried out in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , one block from the office of the Prosec@@ ution . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who ent@@ per@@ forms or how it came to pass , so it was command@@ ing when each in the city knows , that the restaurant has a favorite locally of drugs and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a repor@@ ter from public records , that the restaurant was registered under the name of a poli@@ ti@@ cian , who is governed by the governmental Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( pr@@ i ) , which domin@@ ates nearly the whole century all political levels . &quot;
recently several pr@@ i @-@ govern@@ ors were hum@@ bled because of high @-@ cardi@@ ac cases of corruption .
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real bat acqu@@ a@@ inted the repor@@ ter , including previous inci@@ dents in this local , including one where a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; &quot; was decided by military consideration . &quot;
only a few months ago the reader would have seen the Colum@@ ns of Val@@ dez as the best inform@@ ed source of the kid@@ n@@ apping .
&quot; earlier we would have already knew what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; &quot; El FLA@@ CO &quot; because of its slender body temperature . &quot;
&quot; now , all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; the office of Val@@ dez has become a storage room for characters and stickers that have become sick against the murder of journalists , because the employees have become something that they had never expected , ac@@ tivi@@ sts in the name of the press . &quot;
&quot; Rep@@ or@@ se Miriam Ram@@ i@@ rez , a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalists in the office of the Prosec@@ ution . &quot;
Salvador Ad@@ ame dis@@ appeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed in the Western State of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burned body was discovered and officials said based on DNA tests that it is its .
&quot; in the whole country journalists have become stronger , by organized in organised prot@@ ests &quot; SO@@ S Press &quot; on sal@@ ary and constructions . &quot;
&quot; on this day the director of Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is in Washington and tried to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with the Govern@@ or of Sin@@ al@@ oa on the day after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Val@@ dez @-@ pro@@ claimed Ram@@ i@@ rez the authorities , journalists and to leave them because they have told the truth . &quot;
she has since then asked that she was once more divided by the government because it is worried that their anger is viol@@ ated their obj@@ ectivity .
&quot; Val@@ dez had repe@@ at@@ edly said that journalists in Mexico by organised crime , involved in government agencies and a uniform society . &quot; &quot;
&quot; his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters are not only killed by drug addi@@ tives , but also on the command of politicians and security forces , with organised crime under a ceil@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Artic@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; Artic@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; has been assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and officials . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico , you give because they would like to disp@@ ose the mouth , &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot;
obviously the murder have a det@@ err@@ ent effect .
nobody for@@ got the death of the Blog@@ ger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ li@@ pas six years ago .
&quot; your body was found together with a note that was signed by Z@@ et@@ as @-@ Kart@@ ell , &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a Computer@@ watch@@ word and head@@ phones stood in addition to their separate head .
some stores have chosen to conclude as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the murder of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ro@@ sl@@ ava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to make El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of their director in 2004 .
&quot; 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ are@@ z public@@ ly bound to the drug card with a Editorial on the title page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists are fl@@ ed from their home countries or even out of the country .
it is a pain@@ ful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in ex@@ ile , and they still watch the streets and search for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are dar@@ ed , as it was evi@@ den@@ ied the photographer of Ruben Esp@@ in@@ osa , the 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City of three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who remain back@@ wards and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who was once po@@ et to be , gives that the drug addi@@ tive him . &quot;
&quot; Mexico is going to hell , and so I became repor@@ ter , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the red@@ dish of Ri@@ od@@ o@@ ce on the pav@@ ement in front of the office and d@@ rank beer , when all their phones began to summ@@ ing their phones . &quot;
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with band@@ width and security forces in the vicinity of the beach Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war esk@@ ed further as it was promised by a number of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
from the B@@ ord@@ st@@ ans you have published the news on the website of Ri@@ od@@ o@@ ce via mobile phone .
the title page had to be changed the next day .
Sir@@ enes he@@ ul@@ ten near - another sk@@ ew@@ ers in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez bow@@ ed a look at the polic@@ emen that were re@@ ven@@ ge to see if they were in willingness .
&quot; if they were at all fear , they showed it not . &quot;
&quot; under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle @-@ finger was visible for the whole Sin@@ al@@ oa , followed the staff of Ri@@ od@@ o@@ ce his tracks . &quot;
&quot; how can you just think about it , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; if the same day was mur@@ dered to the Javier , the internship I asked me to send it to the street to the street . &quot;
din@@ osaur@@ s used clo@@ aking in order to spread its enemies .
at first sight it looks like a statue if also a fri@@ ght@@ ening .
&quot; now researchers found that the first findings of the incredible N@@ ash@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian min@@ ers have been so well received , that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa the Din@@ osaur@@ s . &quot;
&quot; it was so well preserved that they could even find that his conc@@ eived skin of red@@ dish Braun was - and they said , they would have had something from a &quot; &quot; un@@ quiet past &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the magazine &quot; Cur@@ rent Biology &quot; signed it as &quot; the ordered din@@ osaur@@ s that was ever found , and one of the best din@@ osaur@@ s spec@@ im@@ ens of the world . &quot;
the Fos@@ sil is a newly discovered type of N@@ od@@ osaur@@ s which lived in the middle of the Cre@@ t@@ ace@@ ous period between 110 million and 112 million years .
&quot; his incredibly well preserved condition has researchers who describe it as &quot; really remarkable . &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the susp@@ ended plant @-@ e@@ aters is the best preserved fos@@ sil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn F@@ unk when he was on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he met something that appeared from the surrounding rocks at the Plat@@ ze , and decided to look more detailed in more detail . &quot;
the Fos@@ sil was sent to him in the Royal Ty@@ rr@@ ell Museum of Pal@@ aces .
&quot; you spent the next six years to cover the wild animal in the 2.@@ 500 po@@ unds ( 1.@@ 100 kg ) of heavy natural clubs . &quot;
&quot; after all of these hard work , the finished product is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you only have a little with the eyes fl@@ ink , you could almost believe that it slept , said the main writer Cal@@ eb Brown , scientists at the Royal Ty@@ rr@@ ell Museum , where the cre@@ ature has to be seen . &quot;
&quot; it is considered to be one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osaur@@ s , the Mon@@ a Lisa the din@@ osaur@@ s . &quot;
researchers have found that this species was covered , although he is covered with a arm@@ or and a changing tanks , probably was threatened by meat so@@ fres@@ her din@@ osaur@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the strong ar@@ oss@@ ed din@@ osaur@@ s used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to hide from pre@@ cip@@ itation , and used a shiel@@ ding technology that is known as oppos@@ ing technology , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have been allowed to develop better in its surroundings and to spread it to its enemies , say experts , which suggests that it was threatened by major din@@ osaur@@ s . &quot;
the 110 million years old cre@@ ature from the family of the N@@ od@@ osaur@@ s took place in May for the first time and is now at the Royal Ty@@ rr@@ ell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ a .
&quot; researchers now study the wild animal study and it was called B@@ ore@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta marked with the Muse@@ um@@ st@@ engine@@ er Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to cover it carefully . &quot;
the amazing preservation of the speci@@ men allowed the Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of shed and arm@@ or about his body .
&quot; they discovered the con@@ du@@ sting , a widespread defence method in the animal world , which means the tip of the cre@@ ature dark was as their under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the con@@ sh@@ ady is common , the results are surprising when the size of B@@ ore@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is far from the today living animals survi@@ ved . &quot;
&quot; it indicates that the din@@ osaur@@ s have had enough pressure through the flesh of fres@@ co din@@ osaur@@ s , that the evolution of the con@@ frontation of con@@ frontation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most of the contemporary animals that con@@ du@@ ll use - think of R@@ before , Zeb@@ ras or belt - are much smaller and more hur@@ ting than loo@@ t that was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong pre@@ datory behaviour on a massive , strong ar@@ oss@@ ed din@@ osaur@@ s show how dangerous the din@@ osaur@@ s have had to have been said , &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compo@@ unds in their sc@@ ales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osaur@@ s @-@ brown was .
scientists continue to investig@@ ate the animal on references about his life including his compli@@ mentary intest@@ ine to figure out what it has e@@ aten when his last meal .
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osaur@@ s , when he died , into a river and carried out into the sea where he s@@ ank down on the back to the sea . &quot;
&quot; at that time Alberta was so warm like southern fl@@ oral today , and rivers and oc@@ eans are likely a lot more widespread than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this N@@ od@@ osaur@@ s is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preser@@ v@@ ented skin , but also in three dimensions , and the original shape of the beast , said Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal today looks almost as much as in the early chal@@ k time .
&quot; you do not need a lot of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just have a little with the eyes shine , you could almost believe that he is at sleep . &quot;
&quot; the chal@@ k time was a time when huge ther@@ op@@ ods , fl@@ esh@@ y din@@ osaur@@ s , which were on two legs , the earth were crossed . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ nos@@ aurus Rex , millions of years after B@@ ore@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta lived , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osaur@@ s was number@@ ed by some of his fear@@ ful ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this belongs to the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ os@@ aurus , a 38 feet ( 11@@ ,5 m ) long , six tons wei@@ ght@@ ed mon@@ sters . &quot;
scientists to appear their most recent findings in the journal Cur@@ rent Biology , believe that B@@ ore@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was transferred to the death in the sea and mud in mud . &quot;
&quot; the cre@@ ature was found by Sha@@ wn F@@ unk when he was on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum it is the be@@ ster@@ ed din@@ osaur@@ s of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is complete from the mu@@ zzle up to the hips . &quot;
the creatures were on average approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have up to 3.000 po@@ unds ( 1.@@ 300 kg ) .
&quot; it contained two 20 @-@ inch @-@ long tips , that rag@@ ed by his shoul@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; the researchers believe that the susp@@ ended plant @-@ e@@ aters was curved by the Western Canada , until a flo@@ od@@ ed river it fl@@ ed into the open sea . &quot;
but the under@@ water cre@@ mation of the din@@ osaur@@ s kept his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ alled re@@ mn@@ ants of this particular spec@@ ars are so well preserved that the inner@@ most still bu@@ mp@@ y Panzer@@ plates along the din@@ osaur@@ s
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as &quot; rare as a gain in the lotto &quot;
&quot; the more I stand , the more conf@@ use it gets . &quot;
pet@@ ri@@ fied res@@ ign@@ ation of the skin still cover the bu@@ mp@@ y Panzer@@ plates that carry the sk@@ ull of the animal .
&quot; his right for@@ ef@@ oot lies on his side , his five fing@@ ers are over@@ pri@@ ced . &quot;
I can count the sho@@ vel at his sole .
in the storm : mass @-@ aram@@ bol@@ age on A8 : many verses
he@@ fty accident at the Thurs@@ day@@ evening on the A8 : just 30 cars are wr@@ apped in a mass @-@ em@@ bol@@ ts .
there are numerous be@@ ers @-@ kilomet@@ re @-@ long poles - and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) have been viol@@ ated at the late Thurs@@ day@@ bo@@ on for about 20 people .
&quot; according to the first data of the police were at 17.00 hours between the connections Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Land@@ kreis A@@ ich@@ ah @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a th@@ under@@ ter nearly 30 cars , including probably lor@@ ries , in@@ consec@@ u@@ tive . &quot;
above the exact number of verses initially no information before .
&quot; it handle s@@ light to medium @-@ heavy injury , said a poli@@ ti@@ cian . &quot;
a large attachment to lif@@ ebo@@ arding was at the accident .
the A8 was completely locked in direction of Munich .
in driving Munich a about ten kilometres long re@@ covering .
&quot; as an A@@ Z repor@@ ter reported , there was also on the counter @-@ drive to massive disabilities - through numerous pro@@ curement . &quot;
the fire@@ bu@@ ckets are the mark of the vehicle &apos;s vehicle that now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties .
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 , a second accident on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a coll@@ ision between an aut@@ ot@@ ting spor@@ ter and a truck .

German railway : Group test@@ et &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everybody has already experienced : nothing is sitting on the train and sleeps .
or it is deep@@ ened in his work and has just got an ing@@ eni@@ ous thought .
and then : Kelly .
comes Schaff@@ ner and arous@@ ed a non@@ sense or ri@@ sts the road@@ cast in the middle of the workflow .
http : / / www.t@@ ar @-@ clan@@ .de /
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are soon over .
the German Rail@@ ways are currently the best @-@ starting point @-@ card control .
&quot; one is simply confirmed by phone , that you should be taken place and s@@ word@@ ing the ticket . &quot;
currently a test mode runs on two distances .
&quot; if the offer is , we offer it off . &quot;
&quot; it will be expected to be available in Germany at the beginning of the coming year , &quot; said a rail speaker . &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; is called by rail trips without Schaff@@ ner @-@ Fo@@ under .
&quot; to use the use , but need to be met some conditions : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to be booked a online ticket - what already do the most passengers .
&quot; it also has to have bought it via the app of the train , the DB Navigator software , which is why the most comfortable type of ticket booking . &quot;
and finally you need a seating book .
&quot; for the &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; works so : you go to the train , calls his ticket under &quot; My Tickets . &quot; &quot;
the test results then appears a button for electronic release .
the train accompan@@ ying on their mobile devices have a message that fare X is on the train and the booked seat Y .
&quot; comes along the train control of place Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already existing online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can go further , continue , continue to mention . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which is to use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; those who would like to travel without Ticket@@ control through our train staff , awak@@ ens in the DB Navigator software itself . &quot;
&quot; this enables drivers to shape their travel time on the train . &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , marketing @-@ board of DB correspon@@ dence . &quot;
&quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today , to respond to individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; who often drives rail , knows that in addition to del@@ ays and missed shots are the driving contro@@ versi@@ es to the biggest sle@@ eves belong to the biggest physi@@ cians . &quot;
&quot; for often , one of the room@@ mate did not have any documents in any case , but one of the room@@ rates do not need any documents concerning the util@@ isation of online tickets . &quot;
&quot; either lack@@ ing the credit card or personal reference , or otherwise a document , which you have to pro@@ pose . &quot;
&quot; the result are endless discussion between train and driving , which leads to worse mood in the waste or space and del@@ ays in control of your own tickets and the Schaff@@ ner at the end the time takes to worry about other concerns . &quot;
even a small number of test@@ ers can use the new service .
and this only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further ac@@ cesses at the same track are not yet released .

&quot; the rap@@ per from the territory of St. Louis was to the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year old , who was killed by a white polic@@ emen in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mon . , killed live to twe@@ ets . &quot;
he post@@ ed a picture of Brow@@ ns alive bodies that was stret@@ ched on the street and stay four hours there .
&quot; this is wild , &quot; thought Ferr@@ ell in itself . &quot;
but death was nothing new for her and her community .
she placed her cell phone to return later in the evening to Twe@@ ets on the Can@@ field Drive .
&quot; there were photos of the police band and people , the cri@@ ed , and by a man who claimed , Brow@@ se Father had to be a sign with the wor@@ ding : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons Police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she observed a live @-@ Feed in which a polic@@ eman stood before a group of prot@@ esters with a bell@@ ish dog .
&quot; in another video , she said that a different polic@@ eman said his head , and cri@@ ed : &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill you . &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; In@@ ner Ferr@@ ell &quot; &quot; to their statement . &quot;
that is not the kind of murder that we have used to us and which we can call it typical .
in this moment I felt ch@@ ills .
I was angry and w@@ ept . &quot;
they booked a return trip and went home the next day .
after the land@@ ing at 23 am she took her 6 @-@ year old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two next morning we would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Ferr@@ ell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the subject of a new documentary , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; in the chin from the 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a history of survival and Protest@@ ant , the love and loss of loss that exists in the population of the people who live in the community and filled the streets to ask answers . &quot;
&quot; as Ferr@@ ell with her daughter , who carried a flowers and a suitable crown , after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two a conversation that they had countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; you remember how I taught you , when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; he remember@@ ed what she said . &quot;
we now go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police have killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right .
&quot; I could not take them , &quot; said Ferr@@ ell later . &quot;
what happened today is a highlight of ... what happened in the past .
it must know and see it and being raised in it .
&quot; it needs to be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have the luck to give her an experience in which they are not experienced e@@ kl@@ at@@ ly rac@@ ism , it is not different from the next black women @-@ child . &quot;
&quot; I have the feeling , I would prove their bad service to keep them off . &quot;
&quot; the first stop when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , there was at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authorities , which was the ac@@ tivi@@ sts in the possible non @-@ pro@@ sec@@ ution by Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there , Ferr@@ ell and her daughter have joined a local business partners , who made lunch . &quot;
they prepared bags in front of and hal@@ ves to ad@@ mit them on prot@@ esters .
slowly I began to take a new kind of activ@@ ism to Ferr@@ ell &apos;s shape .
&quot; my activ@@ ism is completely changed after the 9th of August , she said and noticed that she was at the University of Miss@@ ouri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health equ@@ alities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organis@@ ing .
it is all come . &quot;
weeks later Ferr@@ ell arrived in Ferr@@ ell during an evening @-@ demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ director of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her camer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar wanted to document &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came to Ferr@@ ell in the meaning : &quot; &quot; you want to document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
&quot; these sc@@ ep@@ ticism was fed by countless cases of people , often from past@@ or in a community that benef@@ ited by their pain and its resistance . &quot;
&quot; like Fol@@ ay@@ an recently said in an interview : &quot; &quot; we had heard that people who have born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and raised their voices , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the field which is known for his activ@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; his involvement brought Ferr@@ ell the project closer together with six other loc@@ als followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ se Er@@ in@@ duction . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us . we speak , &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; this was the main thing for me how these people are represented , because I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ ells &apos;s experience - to show that it comes to the movement &quot; not about a Messi@@ ah leader , but about a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the revealed @-@ in of the film . &quot;
&quot; they show documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surpris@@ ingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ ells &apos;s life , as they love and married her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Ferr@@ ell and lau@@ g@@ hed , when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
&quot; but I understood that it has to give a certain vulner@@ ability at this work , and in the cra@@ z@@ ement of black people . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ is history , the role of the black ra@@ ils women in the bro@@ ader Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Matter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three fo@@ unders of the movement , which are characterised by k@@ illing of the Black Teen@@ age Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 the film &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Matter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as pregnant . &quot;
&quot; black , sw@@ ts women in leadership @-@ positions have worn the movement altogether , &quot; said Ferr@@ ell , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting in various fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , g@@ ay women must be the main last of all . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it is that &quot; &quot; this is not a affir@@ mati@@ cal type of action , &quot; which was selected to Ferr@@ ell because of its identity as the heart of the movie . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who opened this energy , she said . &quot;
&quot; it is no co@@ incidence , although it was on the front front , because with a life on these cross@@ es as a black , ra@@ ils woman is so much on the game . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime the news @-@ mates in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on has long gone , but the r@@ acial connections between the church and the police are still living . &quot;
Ferr@@ ell is on nutrition for 2 ½ years because of the block@@ ing of a highway on a demonstration .
&quot; it describes the soci@@ opoli@@ tical atmosphere of the area , which she called her home : &quot; a m@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it compla@@ ined to a voc@@ als and she feels committed to this memory , since then three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on went on the road . &quot;
&quot; it is our duty , to fight for our freedom . &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we have to love each other and support .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
&quot; from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; St@@ om@@ w@@ ahn &quot; : TV @-@ readers discuss about Bit @-@ Gallery
&quot; the bit @-@ gallery moves the people , although it is not yet built for a long time . &quot;
but the idea of a mall on the south side of the pedestrian zone has since the first presentation of 2009 the population in advoc@@ ates and opponents .
cold is hardly leaves a problem .
also on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; will be discussed on our Facebook page .
&quot; while the one to say to the bit gallery : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be real &quot; &quot; ( Nicole newspaper ) , comes from the other hand : &quot; &quot; be no man &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ ets ) or quite simple : &quot; &quot; size &quot; &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot;
&quot; while the advoc@@ ates that a gallery will take more customers in the city , of which the remaining businesses will benefit , fear@@ ed the opponents that then the pedestrian street . &quot;
&quot; to add : the gallery will be planned exactly on the property , on which the peasantry opens , in which 13 directors market@@ ed their products . &quot;
with the beginning of the construction work will be the end .
the Galerie &apos;s Mach@@ er want to integrate the market hall in the new building - namely to Bed@@ a @-@ Square with the possibility to sitting outside sitting .
Simone Rooms : &quot; we have worked almost weekly in the farmhouse market for many years .
&quot; mostly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the countryside always like to be very happy . &quot;
also the but@@ cher @-@ ei we have discovered for us .
&quot; we would like to wish , that even during and above all the gallery of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer . &quot;
in other cities there is also .
&quot; in particular , the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
&quot; Gerd D@@ ensing : &quot; &quot; whether direct mark@@ ers at a market hall in the gallery , comes to the amount of rent . &quot;
&quot; however , it is probably not just too low in the new project . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what shopping in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; clothing , shoes , iron , or supermarkets . I find this superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there are already enough in our city .
one sees how many stores are empty here - some for months and years .
&quot; but since there is not even yet another weekly market , it is so important that at least the market hall stays at least . &quot;
&quot; because after all , the goods offered there is fresh , mostly offered from the producer and is ob@@ end@@ lessly clean . &quot;
&quot; how one sees , stores in a shopping center just by major companies , for the dor@@ mit@@ ory ten@@ ants are often not transfer@@ able for a re@@ ta@@ iler . &quot;
&quot; too bad , speci@@ alty shops are almost no more and what still left , will probably still disappear . &quot;
Wolf Fan@@ del : &quot; a mall with the market hall fits me together .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the peas@@ ant stri@@ kes during the construction time ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even on the duration when the bit gallery will actually come .
or does it already create the Ges@@ kar@@ st Bit gallery prior to distri@@ bute all the shops from Bit@@ burg ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this is simply not going to work .
&quot; and a shopping center , which is empty , also does nobody need . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a farmhouse , there are many - like I find - mean@@ ing@@ less constructions in Bit@@ burg is no place thanks to the well @-@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; when the farmhouse market is broken , again a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
an appropriate simil@@ arity : artist creates portra@@ its with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
&quot; in the middle of space of fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost invisible same - that hang@@ ing from the ceil@@ ing . &quot;
the 30 portra@@ its were created by the artist He@@ ather de@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Polka ... and Haar@@ aus@@ ages that have been sent by Chelsea M@@ anning .
&quot; M@@ anning sent the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former secret service analy@@ st was a 35 @-@ year @-@ old sentence has public@@ ly made as secret diplom@@ atic reports on the website Wik@@ i@@ Le@@ aks . &quot;
the new exhibition which opened on 2 August is now called Be@@ coming res@@ em@@ bl@@ ance ( A suitable simil@@ arity ) .
&quot; it is the product of two years of correspon@@ dence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was transformed into technology , computer sciences and art , and M@@ anning , a trans@@ woman and ground@@ breaking dis@@ si@@ vely , whose condem@@ nation was transformed by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has created by the algorith@@ m analysis of the DNA , which could be created by M@@ anning , and out of the 30 portra@@ its , such as someone can be interpre@@ ted with these genom@@ ic data - the many ways , as they may be interpre@@ ted and the in@@ fi@@ ent determin@@ ism of these interpre@@ tations - but also to identity . &quot;
&quot; M@@ anning that was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already talked about the identify as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sent@@ enced as six pass@@ ages against the Spi@@ on@@ ag@@ eg@@ es@@ etz , Computer@@ bet@@ h and theft . &quot;
&quot; through the prison her picture supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only a single picture - a gra@@ ined , black @-@ white Sel@@ fie , in which M@@ anning is sitting at ease on a road@@ side and a plat@@ in@@ blonde per@@ ch - with which it was associated . &quot;
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg straight from the great success of their 2012 @-@ project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
&quot; in this produced the artist of stran@@ gers from for@@ ensic Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ as such as cigar@@ ette st@@ ony and g@@ um rub@@ ber@@ ty , by adding the DNA from the waste in order to produce a picture of how these people could look like . &quot;
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a tim@@ ag@@ az@@ in .
&quot; they held an interview with Chelsea M@@ anning , while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg with a press release of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not visit this time and she could not photograp@@ hed , so they took contact with Chelsea , and asked whether she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
&quot; the artists and their ar@@ iel@@ ded m@@ use were forced to un@@ equal Bri@@ bles , who have several letters in the course of two years . &quot;
&quot; they even created one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustr@@ ated Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images &quot; which would prev@@ ail a future in which the President Chel@@ seas would be able to see the exhibition in person . &quot;
&quot; that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was released after seven bru@@ tal years after seven bru@@ tal years , was a welcome type of happy incidence . &quot;
&quot; there is now also in the opening of the exhibition some dep@@ loy@@ ed and Star@@ kes , da Donald Tru@@ mp leads to war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ eter sp@@ ells that he should actually fix , further to compens@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg after the wei@@ rd timing of all these things , she said that &quot; &quot; things happen out of a particular reason . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in one on the wall of Galerie , written artistic statement you called for M@@ anning with her over@@ sized signature below ( the &quot; i &quot; in their surname is provided with a heart ) an end of the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose basis of gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall is its mit@@ och@@ ond@@ ri@@ val DNA sequence - a thousand @-@ sequence of C@@ s and G@@ s and As , in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hop@@ ed by integ@@ rating the 200 characters ( or Nu@@ cle@@ ot@@ ide after the high @-@ developed scientific Lex@@ ikon of the artist ) , how much are similar , at least in biological way we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully bring about it is that our gen@@ ome is not to take care of who we are and how open gen@@ etic data for an interpretation and how subj@@ ective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories . &quot;
&quot; DNA @-@ data can tell so many different stories , so that are 30 of these stories . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in an own room is one side from the above mentioned Com@@ ic Nov@@ elle . &quot;
it shows M@@ anning as they appeared with a free @-@ speaking one in the hand of the Disci@@ pl@@ ash of the United States like King @-@ Kong .
&quot; if they address your talk , then they won , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; so never forget the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it came straight from a letter that she wrote me , &quot; said the artist who gre@@ et from Philadelphia . &quot;
&quot; I still get go@@ ose , when I talk about it . &quot;
&quot; M@@ anning has not yet seen the exhibition - as it was predic@@ ted in the Com@@ ic@@ book - but if they should do it , then it will be greeted in the middle of the room of masks which meet like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also focused on how everything was written in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ ature ) , in which its gen@@ etic H@@ ap@@ log@@ groups have been written . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crow@@ ds , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portrait . &quot;
&quot; I wanted to feel that it feels like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement , which also behind their liber@@ ation . &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford because of k@@ illing
&quot; a nation@@ wide crow@@ ding hunt is in progress for a professor at the North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , which were used as susp@@ ects after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal viol@@ ations . &quot;
on Monday we were exhi@@ bited for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) warran@@ t by the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au as well as the acts of the court of C@@ ook County .
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , after several styles died . &quot;
&quot; one of the police authorities of Chicago appeared , that the corp@@ se was discovered on 27 July . &quot;
&quot; officials received a call , came to the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the sacrifice with several in@@ jur@@ ies on his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared a place for dead , and det@@ ectives investig@@ ate the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively seeking the two susp@@ ects . &quot;
L@@ ath@@ em has been a professor of Micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
&quot; Alan K. Cu@@ bb@@ age , the Vice President for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that L@@ ath@@ em has now been in favor and by the status of the Campus of North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a cri@@ minal matter which is examined by the competent authorities , and the North@@ western University co@@ operates in this investigation , &quot; said Cu@@ bb@@ age . &quot;
War@@ ren is a Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
&quot; a spok@@ es@@ man of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement , that we are in contact with the police in Britain and are ready to help the U.S. authorities in any way . &quot;
the statement added that warm colleagues were shock@@ ed and want that he set itself .
&quot; Chief Communications Officer of the police authorities of Chicago , Anthony Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi , said he demand@@ ed the susp@@ ects of the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police has an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to loc@@ ate them , &quot; &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza @-@ building , who had just received a mysterious tip that has just happened in the apartment 1008 . &quot;
the police described the scene as a very cru@@ el .
&quot; Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said , it was un@@ clear whether the inci@@ dent took place on 27 July . &quot;
it was confirmed by Safety amer@@ as that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents : &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the timeline and the background of the sacri@@ fic@@ es , and explore a variety of moti@@ ves , including a possible pre@@ ferences . &quot;
&quot; we will join the WA@@ DA timetable in the near future &quot; - the Russian Vi@@ zep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
&quot; the Russian Vi@@ enti@@ re@@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said , it will not last long until the remaining criteria of the world @-@ anti @-@ dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented to restore the Russian anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) . &quot;
&quot; in a certain stage of ful@@ filling the criteria of the schedule R@@ US@@ A@@ DA , the right to plan and test in cooperation with UK@@ AD ( UK anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA timetable was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; explained Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
the PM commented the second part of the schedule of WA@@ DA to comply with the Code , who describes the criteria for the re @-@ replacement of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organization . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ lu , he does not contain anything that could cause for Russia to concern concern . &quot;
&quot; everything has been announced , everything will be implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , he added . &quot;
&quot; one of the criteria described in the list criteria , however , that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities reported the reported results of by the WA@@ DA approved investigation by the Canadian law@@ yer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren on all@@ eged to public@@ ly accept dop@@ ing in Russian sport . &quot;
&quot; in relation to the matter said Mut@@ co : &quot; &quot; we perform the examination by , because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there was no state programs , and we will not ad@@ mit what does not exist . &quot;
&quot; mut@@ ed words agreed with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian magazine R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ nov came to the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; we have repe@@ at@@ edly said that the report includes contro@@ versi@@ al positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one has before , to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 in the wake of the Dop@@ ing sc@@ and@@ als from the execution of dop@@ ing contro@@ vers@@ ations in Russia .
but you have been allowed to plan and coordin@@ ate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti @-@ dop@@ ing ( UK@@ AD ) .
&quot; after a visit to the main quarters of the organization in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA @-@ General Director Olivier Nig@@ gli , that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA is moving into the right direction &quot; &quot; to be used again . &quot;

Amy Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the sur@@ veys did not work .

&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your business ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software Analytics tools is used to measure employees . &quot;
ret@@ ret@@ t said that they think a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
&quot; in addition to the s@@ nap sur@@ veys and sur@@ veys from certain teams , it offers an heat @-@ card of the company which have at a glance which units have the majority of complaints and which managers are top quality outcomes - so that you can neg@@ l@@ ure why . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s come to see that at the top of the workplace culture , so that you don &apos;t have to be involved in sc@@ and@@ ale , which describes a former employee who have spoken in Sk@@ and@@ ale , who have spoken in Sk@@ and@@ ale , who have talked about the ones who have spoken , they were spoken . &quot;

&quot; prior to using technology to monitor the eth@@ ics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and conver@@ cent offer your software as a service to and put the company with recur@@ ring fees for the use of their products .
&quot; it is a business model and an opportunity to find the approval of Venture Capital investors , which both start start @-@ ups . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February by companies like Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , which became the whole capital at $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; Gl@@ itz@@ ers , $ 10 million in November by Bess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought its entire financing to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments hardly come surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and Venture Capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing complex of research , which shows that today &apos;s employees have to expect more of their jobs than before . &quot;
in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only inser@@ ts .
the employees want to feel that you are accepted and estimated that you give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are glad to feel in a company that their voices are doing , and that the work that you do is worth to make this company &quot; , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Employee Experience at LinkedIn , which is used both Conver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors achieve Ren@@ di@@ tes if their portfolio is well run . company running well when employees are up and committed .
&quot; if the Analytics uses of third parties speak , commitment and use of the employees to increase , it is not a wonder that you can find assistance . &quot;
the data on the employee &apos;s commitment to the experts of the workplace @-@ Culture is important .
but the data are us@@ eless if the administrator of a company take no measures .
&quot; in fact , if a company asks for your feedback , it may have an expect@@ ation that change on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the shift does not come fast enough , or not at all , this dis@@ appointments can be breeding and employees dem@@ oti@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4@@ ,000 suggestions , you need to be ready to have 4@@ ,000 talks about , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who have seen the company to be very much on the coll@@ ecting of data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow the staff , &quot; have you really heard me ? &quot;
take care of it ?
&quot; and if you do not have to worry about why should I ? &quot;
Madi@@ son Reed who will now result in a monthly staff - was able to take action at the same day when a problem is reported on G@@ lin@@ t as salvation .
&quot; and after coll@@ ecting feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees , it was able to organ@@ ise several teams within the company , to organ@@ ise several teams within the company and to add a communication training to tackle the problems . &quot;
&quot; on Ruby Tuesday , the company always receives new insights about the staff , and it hopes that on long run , this leads to a better relationship of workers in a sector that is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not oblig@@ ed to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you will lose customer . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customer , then you will lose businesses . &quot;
the N@@ CAA fixes the two @-@ days practices and makes a long day for the break
it is on 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ player on one side of the new exercise fields of the team are enter@@ tained .
some have moved their tri@@ ft@@ parts and show the back full of swe@@ at the first day of training .
for a good part of the team this un@@ employed is a lunch break .
&quot; players who are written to the summer prices , will return to their audi@@ t exercise before they return next morning at 6 : 30 to the Aqu@@ man Football Center . &quot;
&quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real trem@@ mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a short before the Monday to Tuesday . &quot;
the N@@ CAA elimin@@ ated two @-@ days exercises to facilitate the load of the players and it has actually extended their days - at least until the finale on Friday .
&quot; therefore , the first three train@@ ings of the U@@ C@@ LA at 19 : 15 hrs . &quot;
&quot; the compromise away from the two days is more than one day , which moved the break at the beginning of the camp almost one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six playing hours in West@@ wood practical exercises . &quot;
they are to keep up in the course of August 18 exercises . 20 before the beginning of the formal comp@@ artments for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he emphas@@ ises the rules of N@@ CAA even when they add the diverse routes of the player a further point .
&quot; we put this enormous load three or four days on them , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they simply have pus@@ hed it , they chat on , they are great people . &quot;
I think as soon as we come until Saturday and we have more time it will really great .
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practice as soon as the camp is finished , what is given the clear view of its fields from a bor@@ dering parking lot and the adjacent sp@@ kin center , which is already dre@@ amed with feet , which will have a prot@@ ective network behind a tor@@ p@@ fo@@ sten , no light task will be . &quot;
&quot; bro@@ ins players will occup@@ y the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a dre@@ amed that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people are rent there a room and then set it there to draw an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the video of a practice , it is a fairly good deal . &quot;
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces at parking place 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
I am not doing so not too great wor@@ ries .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy the facts in the fight against f@@ ake messages
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with Fal@@ ding regist@@ rations to Fak@@ ten@@ tions of third parties , and their results under the origin@@ als then show that the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called f@@ ake news . &quot;
&quot; the company said in an opinion on its website , that it will begin with the use of updated machine methods , to recognize the possible fal@@ seh@@ ood , and to send them to Fak@@ uma , which may be showing some results of the point of items from the original product . &quot;
Facebook has been cri@@ tic@@ ised as one of the main points for so @-@ called F@@ ake news , of which many believe that they also have influenced the US pres@@ idential elections in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue with the French vot@@ ers in advance of the pres@@ idential elections , and Germany supports a plan , according to the social media networks , if it didn &apos;t succeed , h@@ asser@@ t post@@ ings like before the elections there in September quickly . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Facebook in a separate statement in German , that in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany will be started a test of new facts review . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the realization , the stories of fact dict@@ ates d@@ third parties want to make people more context in order to make decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , Product manag@@ erin for Facebook @-@ News in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added , that Facebook will continue to be &quot; &quot; test &quot; &quot; to test the &quot; &quot; link &quot; &quot; and on other modifications to his messages , to reduce wrong messages . &quot;
creating a Com@@ ic Nov@@ el : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past the small Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a Squ@@ ee@@ ze music video and was a mar@@ gar@@ ter for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ 1980 and 1980 @-@ 30s .
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of tur@@ bul@@ ent history of its cozy seat at the Guardian River Valley in K@@ ent and is now for inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rhodes , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ i@@ pe@@ e Yor@@ k@@ ur with a pre@@ ference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so beautiful , on the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years , he says angry . &quot;
&quot; what a personal relationship , this letter to keep in my hand . &quot;
&quot; a Castle in England &apos; embr@@ ac@@ ed the time from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustr@@ ated by another , rising British artists - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rhodes , which is based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was un@@ expected . &quot;
&quot; I have only written on the thum@@ bs on the side of a letter that has been written in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jaco@@ b@@ ins , &quot; says he . &quot;
&quot; this is his thumb !
&quot; and he sm@@ elled after smoke , because back then there is a fire because of light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives more than 300 years later , the smell has an effect , as if he himself were also . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who got so with old pap@@ ules , that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have to be a little over@@ rated &quot; &quot; ) seems to be a little over@@ rated , to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rhodes was spent his days to explore the vi@@ kt@@ ori@@ an@@ ic &quot; new &quot; castle , to study the archives , and the many treasures of the castle , like about the mon@@ ated hy@@ mn @-@ heads on walls and bottles , the centuries spent in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he went through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with land@@ scap@@ ed , garden@@ ers and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night d@@ rank he &quot; &quot; Whiskey and started to write . &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust received the full access , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; when Rhodes was a decade later , the staff started to take care of the archive , which he said than &quot; hundreds of years , in which ar@@ ist@@ ocr@@ ats said &quot; &quot; Oh , wir@@ ing it on the loft . &quot;
&quot; Tag@@ eb@@ els , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , maps , those who would be said , &quot; You could mean that land leaves boring , &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fought the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let go all his way ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection uses the castle as a starting point to enter into the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which is a man follows that the newly built castle leaves to join the peasantry of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a rebel@@ lion which occurred 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book with the title &apos; K@@ night@@ ly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rhodes . &quot;
&quot; the farmhouse began in this area and I thought , an insur@@ rection was a good start . &quot;
maybe the two are connected ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firm in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jes@@ u@@ iten@@ pat@@ er , the family of Dar@@ r@@ ell seven years during the English re@@ formation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The Sm@@ ug@@ gler &apos; , presented in the sm@@ ug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ r@@ ell out of the 18th century by filled it a coff@@ ing with stones ( a discovery that was only years later than his coff@@ e@@ el was trig@@ ger@@ ed ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rhodes &apos;s family family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; the gentlem@@ en have believed to be se@@ w@@ ed , always back deb@@ ts and money for things that they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ r@@ ell @-@ men proce@@ eds their deb@@ ts by having rich old women - I imagine them as a he@@ ap of guys , with a talent to adver@@ tise vom@@ iting . &quot;
after the end of his use in the castle Rhodes is looking for other unique scri@@ b experience
&quot; he has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish Wil@@ derness for a Com@@ ic novel on El@@ ä@@ gu@@ ar@@ ki behind the early 20th century , which was called back by nature since then . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back again , &quot; says he . &quot;
&quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to be done again with the condem@@ ned life . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle
with the h@@ itting of the 301 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf the city has started their campaign for introduc@@ ing a new umbrella stamp ( Rund@@ schau between Thursday ) .
still to Thursday Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his head team to keep Nelson Art@@ z the logo and the slogan .
at the end of August it is supposed to give it as a highlight of the campaign a festival on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; or ? &quot; , &quot; ask the makers of the action since yesterday at the post@@ ers on the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel . &quot;
&quot; we think that ( natural ! ) not really , &quot; write them on their yesterday . &quot;
but we use this measure to gain your attention .
and to make clear that it is better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we are the fixed con@@ vic@@ tion that we know as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens about the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city very well . &quot;
&quot; in action it is going to be more than &quot; &quot; only &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it will continue . &quot;
&quot; it applies to form@@ ulate one that gives the city an un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able night@@ stand . &quot;
&quot; finally , they stand in competition with other municip@@ alities . &quot;
the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f can be the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f its new roof @-@ brand name and the campaign .
military forms in Turkey - Er@@ dog@@ an fear of the Army
every year early August advis@@ es in Ankara of the Ober@@ ste Military Council ( Y@@ as ) about penetration and transport in offic@@ er offic@@ er .
so also this week .
at first glance a normal procedure .
&quot; but nothing is routine for the Turkish strike , one year after the put@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; the meeting took no longer in the building of the general stab@@ bing , as before , but in the Am@@ t@@ ss@@ itz of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; now also the five vi@@ zep@@ re@@ mi@@ ers participated now also the five vi@@ zep@@ re@@ mi@@ ers , as well as the minister for defense , home , justice and heat . &quot;
the civili@@ ans were in the Y@@ as in the over@@ seas .
the government moves in the military the bre@@ eders .
&quot; general stab@@ sch@@ ef Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the command@@ ing of the army , the air@@ struggle and the Marine have been dra@@ fted . &quot;
&quot; since the failed co@@ p , he has ris@@ ed State of the 326 Gener@@ als and ad@@ mir@@ als . &quot;
&quot; over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to all@@ eged connections to the movement of the ex@@ ile pre@@ acher F@@ eth@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Er@@ dog@@ an as wire of the put@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; against 486 people , who are to be involved in the put@@ ty of the put@@ ty , this week will be in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the co@@ g , Er@@ dog@@ an had been referred to as &quot; &quot; worship &quot; , &quot; as he may give him the opportunity to puri@@ fy the armed forces &quot; . &quot; &quot;
but did Er@@ dog@@ an the army really under control ?
&quot; end of February published the newspaper &quot; H@@ ür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; an article with the head@@ line &quot; dis@@ comfort in the military @-@ headquarters . &quot;
&quot; on the general Staff give it concern due to an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which manifest@@ ing among other things in the ab@@ olition of the head@@ sc@@ arf ban for sol@@ dat@@ ors , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
the big @-@ pur@@ suit of the army and the security forces goes on in any case .
&quot; in mid July Er@@ dog@@ an by decre@@ ret another 73@@ 95 citizen , among them 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 546 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed that Er@@ dog@@ an seemed to be the military .
the gener@@ als used to be the actual masters of the country .
three times put@@ ted them under calling to their role as guardi@@ ans of sec@@ tional state sor@@ eness .
&quot; after his election in 2002 , Er@@ dog@@ an &apos;s going back to the power of the military step by step back , not least in calling for the reform@@ ists of the European Union . &quot;
former offic@@ ers say Er@@ dog@@ an t@@ aps a Islam@@ isation of the armed forces forward .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; voc@@ al Europe &quot; war@@ ned a not@@ ion named &apos; voc@@ alist offic@@ er who sought after putting fear of persecution abroad as A@@ sy@@ l , the Turkish army is going to be in a few years &quot; full of extrem@@ ists and Sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; true that , such a development could not leave the N@@ ato . &quot;
&quot; anyway , there is dou@@ bts about aci@@ dity to the use of the Turkish army . &quot;
the leaders and oper@@ ation@@ ability have been &quot; weak@@ ened &quot; say N@@ ato diplom@@ ats .
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new US @-@ mig@@ rate plan to change the rules of Green Card , said President Donald Tru@@ mp , quoted from the media . &quot;
&quot; he sees the legal imm@@ ig@@ rants to 50.000 a year lower , strict regulations for the el@@ astic@@ ity of Visa for a fre@@ ez@@ ing work permit and limitations for families @-@ oriented visa . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ can and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; this law will decrease the poverty , w@@ ages and save billi@@ ons of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do this by changing the US as the citizens from other countries of green cards . &quot;
the law will prevent the chains and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will discuss the candidates who have the financial means to support themselves and knowledge to promote knowledge of our economy , &quot; said Tru@@ mp , aims by the American media . &quot;
Ministry of Control wants to get a track for racing
&quot; again , over the past few months over the future of the race boo@@ sts have been crossed - now it should be quite fast . &quot;
&quot; even before the end of the year , it is scheduled to drive on the mar@@ riages , on which the tourist drive . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the racing boo@@ sts in the long term , according to the public transport system , should work on the track in this year . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to order to order the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ steig and get the country at this especially important for tourism , &quot; explained traffic state Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot;

&quot; from this sum , the country take 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , based on its basis the shuttle will be ordered also in the future of the country , is currently finally matched , said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the ministry and the southern railway as the operator were already fixed over the technical details .
&quot; this is the road@@ map , tra@@ ded vehicles and quality standards , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the train company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
this conclu@@ des the R@@ einer Shuttle to be ordered on December 2017 regular .
the racing @-@ shuttle is an especially popular railway connection between the stations of Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ steig .
&quot; in the past months , it was tested in the course of a pilgri@@ mage farm , whether the circuit is used to be suffici@@ ently used in the future to order them again in the future . &quot;
the circuit is also in parts strong in parts .
the rise of sex ro@@ bots is real and we should worry
&quot; just as you thought it was not yet crazy , a new report comes across the technological developments in the field of sex ro@@ bots . &quot;
www.sh@@ ak@@ espeare @-@ berlin.de
Sex @-@ ro@@ bots are currently a big thing .
recently published the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( FR@@ R ) released a report on the development of sex ro@@ bots from the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , em@@ eri@@ zing professor of robot@@ ics and arti@@ ficial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must start to take their rise seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the message of the robot , its shape of the nipp@@ le and the type of fing@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; people make yourself funny , but the companies provide lots of them from , and we will still see much more common to see , &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key in the release of his new report . &quot;
modern Sex@@ pu@@ ps have developed themselves from its in@@ flatable partners to ro@@ bots with a si@@ licon that feels warm and feels with aware of human reactions that can be achieved by arti@@ ficial intelligence .
&quot; the user can also custom@@ ize its ro@@ bots , according to his bel@@ iefs &quot; and to choose everything , from the eyes of the robot to the type of breast war@@ ts up to the type or color of his fing@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; but it will still be dist@@ urb@@ ing , as many ro@@ bots possess the &quot; &quot; person@@ alities &quot; &quot; which would be a st@@ eppe @-@ woman would look like . &quot;
modern Sex@@ pu@@ ps have become ro@@ bots with a sili@@ cone .
&quot; the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x @-@ Rob@@ ots , it allows for example its users to adapt their ro@@ bots to the properties that they find appe@@ aling , such as rel@@ ati@@ ety . &quot;
and then there is the True Compan@@ ion developed Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex @-@ ro@@ bots with pre @-@ program@@ med person@@ alities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of sh@@ bl@@ eness and &quot; Wild Wendy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ uro@@ us &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted as good as possible , the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; like what you like , and she may not know what you like , etc . &quot;
she also has their m@@ oods throughout the day - just like real people !
&quot; you can be tired , be fix@@ ated on conversation or she can be &quot; in mood . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are many dist@@ urb@@ ing aspects in this rise of sex ro@@ bots - not least , because they will replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sible feminine attri@@ butes , which is a step onto Fri@@ gi@@ d ( is here : re@@ stre@@ aming ) Far@@ rah , is a quiet part of the most . &quot;
&quot; True Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibration , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) have a vibration , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; says it on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , this sex ro@@ bots are not just a fetish or just just another Sex@@ toys . &quot;
their emergence and increasing refin@@ ement refer to something Dun@@ kl@@ eres and deeper into our culture on a withdrawal from the Ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with sub@@ mission as an optional enc@@ ore .
&quot; most men will of course hold no sex ro@@ bots , and while the FR@@ R remain their rising pop@@ ularity , nevertheless it remains at the edge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what is crossed out of the con@@ du@@ ons , in terms of the spirit of time , in which we live , very teach@@ ings . &quot;
and many people are not strange or offen@@ sive until they are the free market with the permission .
&quot; there is yet a certain consideration that these highly developed sex ro@@ bots at a time in which the rights of women around the world are threatened , in which there is a president that has shi@@ fted to be att@@ acked by women sex@@ ually . &quot;
the ab@@ err@@ ent aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the maid &apos; ) are not the graphical images that affects the s@@ lu@@ ous body and the engra@@ ved eyes but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a le@@ ap but at the moment it does not feel like a big le@@ ap .
the aim behind this sex ro@@ bots is to produce a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( though with Por@@ no@@ star pro@@ portions ) .
keep your builders that they feel human to make the movement of a real body Nach@@ ah@@ men .
&quot; but , on the point when it comes to their &quot; person@@ alities , &quot; the ro@@ bots represent no real women . &quot;
they cannot separate yourself from their companion or simply go away .
&quot; they have no medi@@ ation or background history , nothing , resulting in independence or anything , what the fantas@@ y tot@@ aler could dist@@ ur@@ b . &quot;
other expressed : you are f@@ ake sl@@ aves .
or to express it in the realisation of 2017 : maid
Tru@@ mps Big Power ?
he makes eva Rom@@ ney to the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy life
&quot; it is too a bin@@ ary of the Tru@@ mp @-@ era so that the political sphere have pol@@ ari@@ zed , which have the US @-@ leg@@ acy , also families in small format . &quot;
around Christmas and the appointment made it in the USA newspapers with advice on how to deal with the hor@@ ror of Tru@@ mp chose relatives .
we str@@ ingent for all supp@@ os@@ edly let us let our filter bu@@ b@@ bles .
&quot; less regist@@ ering is the power of Tru@@ mps , families together . &quot;
&quot; I consider this because my cous@@ ine , a law@@ ned servant that lives in Chicago and has long been visited with the Republi@@ cans in our family , I visited this week in New York . &quot;
they rem@@ ind@@ ed me that the unity of a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; Tru@@ mp in the White House is everyone who knows them , including its republi@@ can relationship with whom she fought with decades , suddenly and very pec@@ uli@@ ar on the same page . &quot;
&quot; around the dining table , this is certainly a good thing , but it falls me in another connection that this also brings considerable risks involved . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the stor@@ ing effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push all of us to the right . &quot;
&quot; if we speak of &quot; norm@@ alisation &quot; and Tru@@ mp , we refer to the gray one that his k@@ ittens will no longer be rep@@ aired . &quot;
&quot; however , there is a still sh@@ re@@ conc@@ eived long@@ time scenario in the Tru@@ mp Republi@@ can of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards as an ep@@ it@@ ome of leg@@ rounds . &quot;
&quot; I find myself today from an active stal@@ gia for mitt Rom@@ neys ur@@ inary version of the crazy - the dog on the Aut@@ od@@ ach , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax statement looked ) - both compared to Tru@@ mp in fact a very mild pun@@ ishment . &quot;
if Tru@@ mp comes to quali@@ fy the next can@@ did@@ acy of the Republi@@ can only ment@@ ally healthy to quali@@ fy themselves as imm@@ eas@@ urable improvement .
&quot; when my cous@@ ine in the city was , we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park , the largest of the Car@@ uss@@ ells of New York &apos;s Park@@ department , and the best three dollar that can be put in the city if you need no caff@@ eine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fiber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cr@@ ur@@ ry and the animals turned out to look at full fear of their own shoul@@ ders - very dark and the kli@@ m@@ per@@ ing music gives this in strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és in a city dis@@ ap@@ point : the views of high buildings are old , the Sky@@ lines are becoming familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice . &quot;
five @-@ five years later and I am still not quite over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed no Swiss Cottage - the subject of pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a great roundabout in the north of London .
&quot; however , the Central Park @-@ Carousel is still a strange magic experience , since there are two two @-@ year old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s , and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I have made the carousel the carousel , I would have given him full score , but fortunately no one has asked for it . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my credit card in this week , my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale from one to five stars , before I managed my credit card . &quot;
&quot; at the top of my street it is the same , plus the option to complete the rating with a 15 % to@@ lica - this to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this leads not only to a slow@@ ing of what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also put pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation in which no need is required . &quot;
&quot; poor woman in the department store was ap@@ olog@@ ically limit@@ ing , while I made tired the experience made you submit my credit card with five stars . &quot;

software update for diesel vehicles : what the person concerned now need to know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers have to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers in overview .
&quot; at the Diesel summit , BMW , Daim@@ ler , Opel and the VW Group software updates are offered for a total of around 5,@@ 3 million cars . &quot;
&quot; you are supposed to improve the gas emissions by cars of the emissions of Euro 5 , and partly Euro 6 . &quot;
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or inf@@ eri@@ or are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in from ACE Auto Club Europe sets reviews :
is the new action compul@@ s@@ ory ?
no , the tra@@ ded software updates are voluntary . &quot;
&quot; the oblig@@ atory updates are previously valid for vehicles , the drawer software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
their retro@@ fitting has arranged the power@@ train station ( KBA ) .
how and from when will customers get informed about updates ?
the makers have announced a whol@@ ly implementation in the next months but still no exact date .
Daim@@ ler has respon@@ ded to write every person concerned .
&quot; if there is a inspection , that will be done in their frame . &quot;
how long is the conversion of retro@@ fits ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
the relations with the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from the political pressure .

we make the city li@@ des@@ irable
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister in the coming year in R@@ ents . &quot;
the spot is already written - suitable applic@@ ants are excep@@ tionally .
for 31 years W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
&quot; and the work still makes him great fun , as he taught in the press @-@ talk . &quot;
&quot; he reports of di@@ versi@@ fied , but also demanding tasks that are waiting for his successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , make it wonder@@ ing that so far there is no application of the requirements profile . &quot;
the town is searching for the next time an architect or Bau@@ engine@@ er .
thus - according to the regular dism@@ is@@ sal cancellation - still enough time for revision .
&quot; da Has@@ l@@ ach , for the administrative community as the sub@@ mission authority , the applic@@ ant must be submitted according to the applic@@ ants . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; if it would not be able to fill them out more , the citizen would have to go through to Off@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; but civil war is important , the city and itself is important , says W@@ acker , who reported by a good business li@@ ma as well as a good mood between authority and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in over 30 years in office , some significant projects have accum@@ ulated to the W@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city li@@ des@@ irable , he is confident about the building and his staff . &quot;
but also in the future there are di@@ versi@@ fied projects on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ cl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Lower parking lot are around .
the chin @-@ bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed and the stadi@@ on@@ ation is still a topic .
&quot; the latter will strike with around 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; when we do it right , &quot; &quot; W@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my success@@ ors . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
&quot; alter@@ ed , be there for a town@@ ship of great play@@ room . &quot;
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s its own builder and garden@@ er could be quite flexible and flexible .
&quot; one can move much , so W@@ acker , and the design of the green plants will often mention citizens and visitors often pra@@ ising . &quot;
&quot; as the old town &apos;s old town appears as ensemble , be it important to have &quot; an eye to do what pur@@ suits , &quot; if res@@ umes are approved , st@@ resses the separ@@ ating Stadt@@ bau@@ master . &quot;
ohn@@ s@@ in contributes to the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister high responsibility .
&quot; he is builder , &quot; in the end everything is running here above my table . &quot;
&quot; with care and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been here for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Tief@@ bau ) has been around for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also that his successor is long , wishes W@@ acker : &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really want to be identified with the place . &quot;
&quot; for continuity is not only important for a good company , but also for the further development of the city . &quot;
who wish to congrat@@ ulate Roland W@@ acker should have a closed study for information on the city of Has@@ l@@ ach and have good expertise in the fields of construction and building services .

according to police the ever known per@@ petrators had thro@@ wn the blue bike from the railway line in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener street ( B@@ 116 ) to the lines .
these were so heav@@ ily damaged when the her@@ e@@ ful frei@@ ght will have to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators proceed from two male men and are looking for the night hours after them .
near the setting of witness a ros@@ ar@@ ous wheelchair and a bike driver has been observed .
&quot; this goes far beyond an Laus@@ bu@@ b@@ enst@@ reich , &quot; &quot; Ö@@ BB @-@ spok@@ es@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to AP@@ A . &quot;
the or per@@ petrators have taken themselves in a great danger even and also end@@ anger@@ ed the trains .
in addition to the damage to the Lo@@ k and the system as well as the delay and the cost of rail transport can also get to the per@@ petrators of the rail customers .
&quot; overall , from a &quot; significant &quot; sum , &quot; said the spok@@ es@@ man . &quot;
the damage was back on the day afternoon back off the railway traffic on the south road could be led without disabilities .
&quot; nearly ten person@@ alities were fallen in Fri@@ day@@ morning , two of them consider the correspon@@ dence . &quot;
&quot; they did not come from , but they had del@@ ayed . &quot;
according to Ö@@ BB @-@ speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be replaced around 200 metres of upper @-@ lines .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , milk products and chocolate could help , IB@@ D ( anti @-@ in@@ flam@@ mat@@ ory intest@@ ine ) &quot;
rot@@ ating meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare .
&quot; but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and milk products , could alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with anti @-@ in@@ flam@@ mat@@ ory diseases . &quot;
&quot; the inc@@ urable condition , which affects the USA approximately 1.3 million and in the UK 300@@ .000 , causes magn@@ anim@@ ity and blo@@ oms , weight loss , and extreme ti@@ red@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; while the suffer@@ ers are usually fr@@ ying , meat and milk products to alle@@ vi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Wash@@ ington@@ er University , found researchers at the Wash@@ ington@@ er University , that the essential amino acid Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins to develop , which provide a toler@@ ant intestinal tr@@ act . &quot;
&quot; the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells in the intestinal pat@@ rol , to ensure that bad micro@@ bes , which hide in the food not into the body . &quot;
&quot; cells , which are capable of in@@ flam@@ mat@@ ory , are balanced by cells to fo@@ ster the tolerance and protect the body without sh@@ atter . &quot;
&quot; if the balance is too far in the direction of in@@ flammation , it may result in such a anti @-@ in@@ flam@@ mat@@ ory diseases . &quot;
&quot; experim@@ ents was found that a type of tolerance promoting immune cells in mice , which carry out a certain bacter@@ ium in their initi@@ ates . &quot;
and the bacter@@ ium requires Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to create the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said , &quot; We have a connection between a bacter@@ ium art - Lac@@ tob@@ ac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the intest@@ ine micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that encourage tolerance to promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he proposed that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one to Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han rich diet toler@@ ant , less anti @-@ in@@ flam@@ mat@@ ory Dar@@ mm@@ ili@@ eus promotes the same system also in people . &quot;
&quot; the post@@ doctor@@ tor@@ an@@ din Dr. Luisa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an under@@ built a kind of immune cells that encour@@ ages the tolerance as she turned out that a group of study leg@@ acies had such cells , but a different group of the dess@@ ert tribe , which had not separate . &quot;
&quot; it pres@@ ump@@ hed that the difference with the intest@@ ine of mice had - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i which are usually live in the stomach intest@@ ine . &quot;
the intest@@ ines of the mice were found DNA sequ@@ enced and there were six bacterial types available in mice with the immune cells , but without them were lack@@ ing among the mice . &quot;
mice were raised in a ster@@ ile environment so that they did not developed a dar@@ ker and they did not developed this type of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells . &quot;
&quot; to understand how the bacteria laid out to the immune system caused by the researcher L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a fluid , and then transferred small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ri@@ pe immune cells that were isolated from the mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ ant cells .
&quot; when the active component was clean@@ ed from the fluid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ Met@@ abol@@ ism , which is known as an in@@ ol @-@ 3 @-@ militar@@ ic acid . &quot;
&quot; when the researchers have dou@@ bled the amount of Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the food of mice , the number of such cells increased by approximately 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ ical values have been decre@@ ased , decre@@ ased the number of cells around half . &quot;
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an explained that people have the same ten@@ ance @-@ promoting cells such as mice and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our stomach @-@ intest@@ ines .
&quot; it is not known whether Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by L. reu@@ ter@@ i , the cells in people develop as with mice , but def@@ ects in gen@@ es in relation to Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with anti @-@ in@@ flam@@ mat@@ ory gi@@ mer@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something that we would like to promote , since these cells will control in@@ flammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot;
potential can lead high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ ical values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i to a cur@@ ing of these populations .

&quot; new fre@@ er for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem
&quot; however , the wind turns out : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD @-@ Chef , the Social Democratic Minister of Minist@@ ers always came to a certain concern for Berlin . &quot;
&quot; just no dist@@ urb@@ ing out of the party central , just no counter@@ wind from the covenant - thus was the most important desire of the vote @-@ fig@@ hts . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , the fundament@@ ally changed . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ house with growing dra@@ fting the events in the SPD @-@ governmental region . &quot;
&quot; what about the beginning of the year has been given since the beginning of the year , this wind would not be described in the approach . &quot;
there were high@@ ways .
and indeed one after the other .
the federal @-@ CD@@ U sees the surprising ending of red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony a gener@@ ative signal against co@@ ali@@ zes of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; this is once more : red @-@ green can simply be rem@@ ind@@ ed &quot; , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ Secretary of Peter Tau@@ ber the editor of Editorial Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
the surprising fac@@ tion@@ ing of a Green MP@@ s has short@@ ened the government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) in a serious crisis .
five months before the day@@ time election is lost its red @-@ green coalition with the opposition from the CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
Michael Kell@@ ner is asked to return to their man@@ date to their man@@ date to their man@@ date .
the over@@ occurs to the CD@@ U means a clear del@@ e@@ tion of the w@@ ron@@ age .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ west must immediately give her man@@ date , &quot; &quot; said the federal government and elect@@ oral leader of the Gre@@ ater network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this must not be true all of this , &quot; sig@@ h a SPD @-@ vote @-@ fig@@ hts , than in the release of the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ bot@@ b . &quot;
&quot; Stephan W@@ eil , SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is after the crossing of the green members of the El@@ ke South@@ west to the CD@@ U without their own ruling class . &quot;
it is the pro@@ visional highlight of a whole series of large and small c@@ rises in SPD associations .
and no one knows what next comes .
the Mis@@ ere began with the un@@ expected defeat at the Saarland @-@ election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , so@@ othing the com@@ rades . &quot;
after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ West@@ ph@@ alia will be all different .
this was then again - and that everything was clearly worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the diving , the Düsseldorf @-@ Pl@@ ast@@ ed Party . &quot;
cool@@ ed r@@ app@@ ed the com@@ rades in the weeks there@@ after .
&quot; then , when they had a new courage , the G @-@ 20 @-@ Summit came from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him the next deep @-@ r@@ ash came .
&quot; Mayor Ola@@ f Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD Land@@ esch@@ ef , lost on that weekend his n@@ im@@ bus , because he sat down in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burned . &quot;
&quot; and because he did in the crisis @-@ communication , then pretty all wrong , what you can do wrong . &quot;
since then has been fighting for his political survival .
now also Stephan W@@ eil .
&quot; because of the VW Be@@ ati@@ fication and his role in the Super@@ visory Board , the lower Prime Minister has already been in criticism since long @-@ term criticism . &quot;
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps just the reason tried to continue W@@ eil in the past few weeks , in the Bund number@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the asp@@ ir@@ ving of the former bourgeoisie of Hannover , his power in Berlin also failed to feed com@@ rades in the environment of Martin Schulz . &quot;
they left him as they spoke of we@@ eil a stabili@@ zation of the party .
&quot; now , the exact opposite could enter . &quot;
the wed@@ ge at the part@@ ei@@ internal compul@@ sion is basically no gu@@ ilt .
and Schulz does not exist at all .
inser@@ ts stri@@ ve to keep the com@@ rades who have to hold his own ranks .
&quot; your wrath is aimed at the Gre@@ ens , and here especially on the suc@@ cession of parliament@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , like Ms T@@ sang her own career , says Matthias Mier@@ sch , Chief of the Party in the SPD @-@ Bun@@ destag ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. T@@ west is not elected because of its person as a direct did@@ acy , but on the provin@@ cial list of the Dutch Gre@@ eks , so the lower members . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that her man@@ date back .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Chief of the SPD @-@ Bun@@ destag &quot;
&quot; the W@@ äh@@ p@@ ille four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan W@@ eil to the Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the lower @-@ Sax@@ on SPD as a pointed candidate at the r@@ nd . &quot;
&quot; now the personal Carnival comm@@ em@@ oration of a future CD@@ U @-@ EP@@ s the W@@ ah@@ ouse outcome , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;

sponsor@@ ing for Ort@@ sk@@ ern III
&quot; who wants to come to the years in the years , you can soon get support from the country . &quot;
&quot; moreover , Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representative St@@ eg Stadt@@ Museum on Wednesday in received . &quot;
at the beginning of the information Event Sch@@ ind@@ ler gave a review to the previously occupied .
since 1991 there was in emp@@ f@@ ingen san@@ itation @-@ areas .
&quot; back then , in the restoration area I from 1991 to 2004 , the land of Baden @-@ Württemberg has taken over two thir@@ ds of the sponsors . &quot;
in the refurb@@ ishment from 2005 to 2016 the supplement still stood at 60 percent .
&quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous renovation project &quot; &quot; - it is ultimately important to promote the internal development , not only new construction areas . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , one of the government of the Pres@@ ence to Karlsruhe will get the information that it will give a san@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; the total amount will be charged EUR 333 Euro , which took place 500 000 Euro from the country , the rest of the municipality . &quot;
how is a san@@ itation ?
&quot; one become , so Sch@@ ind@@ ler continued , examine where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; but it also play a role , whether in the planned area is interest at all interest . &quot;
possibly the area may also be shi@@ fted again .
the St@@ eg contract at the Wedn@@ es@@ person Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; the basement were presented to the contents of the federal state of the federal state of the federal state &quot; &quot; Social Town &quot; , &quot; within its framework the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; the core of the program are the Rev@@ it@@ alization of inner points , improving the living and employment and expansion and expansion of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be obj@@ ect@@ able , i.e. per plot . &quot;
the San@@ i@@ fication was then determined as a stat@@ utes .
the authori@@ zation period for the promotion runs since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2017 .
&quot; even until September this year , this year would only once again be performed the invent@@ ory , as part of those involved in the renov@@ ations of the parties involved . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the pro@@ posi@@ tional sign will be done , so that the coming year will be started with the renov@@ ations . &quot;
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann explained that every Commun@@ e perform the pron@@ ounc@@ ed pre@@ ventive investig@@ ations .
&quot; it is therefore going to assess the capit@@ als of mis@@ i@@ ries and decide when it comes , and to what extent . &quot;
it will then be registered for the respective property as well as a san@@ itation .
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann I will come back again and get an impression of the situation , she spoke . &quot;
&quot; Got@@ o st@@ ressed , a major success factor for the project is the participation of the participants . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there will be question@@ naires that will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow question@@ na@@ ire is the &quot; &quot; building and ground@@ ing &quot; , &quot; in which it comes among other things about the structural situation and the renov@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; question@@ na@@ ire , the &quot; household and housing &quot; , &quot; you can have information about size , distribution and inhabitants of a residential area . &quot;
&quot; the blue &quot; &quot; batteries &quot; &quot; is only to be filled if in the building business rooms are operated . &quot;
&quot; however , however , God@@ head pointed out that there is no question@@ na@@ ire at the same time a request for funding is . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , we are not encour@@ aging . &quot;
Sch@@ ind@@ ler st@@ ressed that the distribution of funding is according to the &quot; wind @-@ hund@@ red@@ principle - who first comes , ma@@ ins first . &quot;
&quot; we cannot reserve the background for later &quot; &quot; reservation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at the end there were also photos of the project &quot; &quot; Ort@@ sk@@ ern II &quot; &quot; to make the present a san@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; British invent@@ ors themselves sets itself a micro@@ chip , in order to come with a hand movement in house and car . &quot;
&quot; a British inv@@ entor is the first in the country which is equipped with a micro@@ chip , so he can open his door@@ step , and even start with a hand movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , had implan@@ ted the tiny chip between thum@@ bs and periods and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simpli@@ fy life with technology through its company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he has joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a advis@@ ory An@@ a@@ es@@ thes@@ es at the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implan@@ t procedure is performed according to medical standard . &quot;
the technology res@@ em@@ bles a cats and dogs implan@@ ted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one has now installed both at home and at his BMW Z@@ 4 Technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
the promoti@@ onal cost of the White House will cost the tax@@ pay@@ ers .
&quot; the decision of the White House , a marine heli@@ copter to the South Law@@ n for an event to fly the American production in the last month , tax tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the information of the military , which were transferred to the TIME magazine up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , the heart of the event was on board on July 17th in the White House with American building programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and introduc@@ tory officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states . &quot;
&quot; in Connecticut &apos;s heli@@ copter was issued next to a yacht of Ma@@ ine , a fire@@ man drive from Wisconsin and a for@@ kli@@ ft from Mississippi . &quot;
&quot; the military office of the White House slow@@ ed the presence of the heli@@ copter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fr@@ ago , barely 36 hours before the heli@@ copter above the Marine Heli@@ copter squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit which is responsible for the operation of the heli@@ copter . &quot;
&quot; I only wanted to realize that you are aware of this , because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the command of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 in the eve of the event of his court , the Deputy @-@ industrial de@@ aer@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; the message shows that the heli@@ copter arrived on July 17th at 7 am in the morning at the South Law@@ n for the event at 15 o &apos;clock , and so long remained until the lawn between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening was clean@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the note adds to add that if the departure should be held from the White House , due to the limitation of the services needed a second team for the flight back . &quot;
&quot; the original flight Stat@@ utes there was during the event at the heli@@ copter , while the security vulner@@ abilities of unity during the period remained on the ground on the plane . &quot;
&quot; from the TIME made available , it was not clear whether a second flight must be required . &quot;
&quot; Hat@@ ch Act reveals federal , state ownership of political purposes . &quot;
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked whether the event could hurt the purpose .
&quot; one question we asked whether it was a violation of the Hat@@ ch Act , and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the command . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are shut , &quot; rep@@ lied the Deputy comm@@ ander . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was referred to as official event as an official event and would not be covered by the Hat@@ ch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the President gave the President to reform of the healthcare reform which was in the Senate , and he pro@@ pag@@ ed the efforts to inv@@ asi@@ fication of government rules . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft , which is known as Marine One or Air Force One , made of politically advant@@ age@@ ous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot;
pres@@ id@@ ents are oblig@@ ed to use them for the journey .
&quot; but their use only for a photo @-@ OP is un@@ common , is unusual . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp led in February an investigation into February than the pres@@ idential election in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that decre@@ ased by using the pres@@ idential elections through its pre@@ de@@ cess@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products made of all 50 states which are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the Deputy Pres@@ ses@@ ek@@ ary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws frequently lead training trips in the area around Washington and in the South Lav@@ n by reset the U.S. president in the White House with conc@@ ise cen@@ timet@@ ers .
as Tru@@ mp early July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany was led H@@ MX @-@ 1 in the White House 58 exercise land@@ ings .
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event in the training needs for the month , said an official . &quot;
Hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter @-@ units fl@@ ed in addition 11 hours a day for &quot; non @-@ pres@@ idential suppor@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers have been introduced for none of the other refl@@ ections , which were presented at the event . &quot;
&quot; a spok@@ es@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said , the company has not been involved in the heli@@ copter above the South Law@@ n . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not hold any bud@@ get@@ ters for the pres@@ idential elections and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
&quot; according to the US Def@@ ence of the US Def@@ ence Ministry for the fis@@ cal year 2017 , the DO@@ D @-@ 3D order applies to the V@@ H @-@ 3D however 24.@@ 380 USD per flight . &quot;
Records of the unit show the flight time of the airport as 30 minutes from the home base of Marine Cor@@ ps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the white house ar@@ gues that the actual cost of the operation of the heli@@ copter has a wide range under this rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of estimates for ref@@ unds , is most mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; this estimates include staff , maintenance and many other cont@@ amin@@ ated costs that are included in the annual resources . &quot;
&quot; according to a border study from the year 2015 included the ref@@ unds for DO@@ D not include the personnel , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract . &quot;
&quot; at this time , the former Pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ cher of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , the use of the heli@@ copter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present these week things that are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the State of Connecticut remain very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I go out that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot;
and I think as most Americans are all proud of the heli@@ copter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ ess@@ ly .
naturally it is appropriate to emph@@ asi@@ ze this .
&quot; it was not clear whether Tru@@ mp with the heli@@ copter inter@@ acting , when he entered his tour across the South Law@@ n for the event , but he sat down into the chassis of a fire@@ man . &quot;
in the Wei@@ sse House spoke Tru@@ mp to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and scher@@ hed with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

this continuity is important for the children .
&quot; the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita @-@ spaces - so far the task of the chef , will be done in the future by specialized clean@@ ers . &quot;

a trade union would like to contribute to the managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer &apos;s Mc@@ Vi@@ tie on the long term commitment to production in Glasgow .
G@@ mb Scotland said that the company has written over the future of investments on the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the factory , which is in addition to other products of Hob@@ b@@ bs and Rich Tea Kek@@ se . &quot;
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pl@@ adi@@ s said he has invested more than 5 million po@@ unds in recent years .

generations of families have worked here and the labor force focus on the local community and the Gre@@ ater Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social dis@@ advantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , the wage and well @-@ resistance , and in front of the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising living machine costs and of the chron@@ ic production process , the eastern end of Glasgow strongly encourage a fl@@ oral production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;

&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; in recent years we added to our T@@ oll@@ cross site more than 5 million po@@ unds , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;

does the PSG Barcelona has been war@@ ned three years ago N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the page of La Lig@@ a likes their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Germain is not trac@@ eable in its persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar after they had submitted an offer of £ 189 million in order to war@@ ned his free @-@ key@@ ing ten@@ ant but they have been war@@ ned three years ago before the world war ?
&quot; the sens@@ ational approach has raised the transfer window in the summer , for the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the pupp@@ y of the previous mark , with Paul Pog@@ ba in the past season for 89 million Pf@@ und to Manchester United returned . &quot;
&quot; after the end , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the most paid professional ath@@ letes of the world . PSG offers w@@ ages of more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
Barcelona is angry about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has given his way out outside as N@@ ey@@ mar has given his way out near the Catal@@ ans @-@ insur@@ rection that the club has always been his best to take care of the San@@ tos in 2013 to take it .
but the football world was war@@ ned over three years ago by the PSG @-@ President in front of this view ?
&quot; in Manchester City 2014 are interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict remin@@ der for each club who wanted to sign one of the best players from PSG . &quot;
&quot; I am not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , then we will contact opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign up one of our players in sign , this will have consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have passed this line with the Spanish Association start of this summer interest in the PSG @-@ Mittel@@ field Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
&quot; PSG made clear that they would not allow it to be the International from Italy in any circumstances , and Barcelona could sense the consequences of this interest by taking one of their prize for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;

&quot; in the final report , it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active in Reg@@ ensburg on 1964 till 1994 in Reg@@ ensburg : &quot; in a summary , that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. have been applied by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases of physical and psych@@ ological violence . &quot;
&quot; especially at high en@@ no@@ on@@ ality , the pun@@ ishment could also fall off for the pu@@ pils at the same time . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , unlike many other pro@@ sec@@ ts that many victims are estimated that many victims are estimated and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories with him . &quot;
in the interview H@@ es@@ emann is explained why the final report for mis@@ use sc@@ andal with the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger took his opinion after di@@ schar@@ ged .
Mr. H@@ es@@ emann , the 440 @-@ pages report on the &quot; &quot; Inci@@ dents &quot; &quot; on prot@@ agon@@ ists at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; gives a contradic@@ tory image of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
for a lift many students say his &quot; humanity . &quot;
&quot; he also appears as a chol@@ eri@@ ker and perf@@ ection@@ ist , who made the ö@@ f@@ teren , if a dom@@ right@@ eous was musi@@ cally no top performance . &quot;
how do you think as his bi@@ ograp@@ her this conclu@@ ding ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : when you read the trouble and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back , one has to ask yourself , why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all in it . &quot;
it is dedicated even eight sides and he is clearly talked about any sus@@ pic@@ ion of the medi@@ a@@ - or co @-@ workers with the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
also the imp@@ acts at the fore@@ front of the school was beyond its efficiency .
you can decide to know about it or have not taken seriously enough of them or have taken their first post@@ pon@@ ies seriously .
&quot; the sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ n@@ ville , on which he was realized by practically all respon@@ dents as - as literally - &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; so also the vast majority of his pu@@ pils Georg R@@ atz@@ inger puts a very excellent result , &quot; &quot; sinc@@ ere , &quot; &quot; sinc@@ er@@ ely , &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; sinc@@ er@@ ely , &quot; &quot; sinc@@ er@@ ely , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; and &quot; understand@@ able &quot; , &quot; who suppl@@ em@@ ed the guys regularly with cakes , bis@@ cuits and Bon@@ b@@ ons and &quot; always of grapes from children . &quot;
&quot; only a minority is worth about his perf@@ ection@@ ism , and its high tur@@ bul@@ ality , which also led to wol@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; that he did not only cast with some chairs and put the key@@ chain on the ground , but also pointed out guys to the hair or ears he already gave himself to the hair , deeply reg@@ ret and exc@@ used for them . &quot;
&quot; to his hon@@ esty must be said however , that such investig@@ ations must be widespread in the frag@@ ile period , the 1960@@ s and 19@@ 70s , which were widespread in parents like in teachers . &quot;
do you still know such a Bre@@ eding @-@ methods ?
&quot; of course , I think everyone of us who was born in 1968 . &quot;
&quot; also I have experienced this in a world @-@ sec@@ ular school , a state Gymnasium . &quot;
&quot; compared to what it is actually going on this report , namely the plac@@ eable sexual abuse and of non @-@ violence , are the free of Bag@@ at@@ ellen . &quot;
&quot; if you ask yourself , whether it is no more likely to do with his famili@@ arity and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct X@@ VI@@ . that many media has just returned to him . &quot;
&quot; in the Bav@@ arian pop@@ e , many who have never understood him , still e@@ ager . &quot;
but the truth is : the report ent@@ last@@ et Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
the media has been reported much about the subject of abuse at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the Final Report as well as any imp@@ lication or co @-@ workers with regard to sexual abuse at the burden ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : very clearly no .
none of 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have familiar with the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; I never dre@@ w me to speak with my father or my mother who said , &quot; &quot; said , &quot; &quot; said , I was very embarrass@@ ing for the others , &quot; &quot; It happened to me everything very embarrass@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; the true issue in the enlight@@ enment of sexual abuse was , and is that most victims was silence . &quot;
&quot; if they were not even parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral conductor , who would have been a colle@@ ague of the per@@ petrators we have been a colle@@ ague of the per@@ petrators . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &apos;s pu@@ pils rate role in terms of mis@@ use ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : a question@@ able student form@@ ulated it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he could have had their own findings and could have been stopped the respective per@@ petrators .
&quot; I think it ... also for really ab@@ sur@@ d , imagine it ... rep@@ lic@@ ate and clear@@ er or more likely to have opened , as opposed to their parents , internet access , confidence etc . &quot;
that one speaks to him about sex ... - un@@ th@@ ink@@ able . &quot;
&quot; thus , the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; that in the field of affected students and / or their environment , he could not be confirmed in the scope of the investigation . &quot;
what sexual abuse is concerned about Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus to speak of any co @-@ workers .
&quot; so , it cannot be thro@@ wn into him , not prev@@ ented him or have brought to the ad . &quot;
&quot; therefore there is no reason to bring his good name with these contradic@@ tory crime , as unfortunately in some cases . &quot;
in the media was a lot of &quot; non@@ violence &quot; to read in the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will be thro@@ wn into the report . &quot;
does he have to live with this ac@@ cus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : this is the big problem that in reporting everything mixed and bl@@ ended up to a huge mel@@ ange made of sexual abuse and violence , and somewhere , in the middle of , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but this is again a mis@@ use of the report .
&quot; it is completely separated from : between the pre @-@ school and the Gymnasium of Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violence , as well as , let &apos;s say , other appe@@ aling . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report also deals with acci@@ dents in the period since 1945 , therefore also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not Chor@@ us of the cathedral sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; all terrible conditions of ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases , in which fl@@ aws of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were scru@@ pul@@ ated and Malt@@ ese , who have been ru@@ led to the fore@@ fathers in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to be ru@@ led . &quot;
&quot; but with them Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys only to face , when they had already been on the domain . &quot;
&quot; on that was , as the most witnesses emph@@ asi@@ ze the theme of &quot; pre @-@ school &quot; tab@@ u . &quot;
one was only happy to escape you and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly &quot; states .
what was different from the cathedral @-@ insur@@ ances ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : there was already discipline , but just no sa@@ di@@ stic violence . &quot;
&quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , where the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims are estimated and therefore often positive memories with him in many cases . &quot;
&quot; so , at the most remains the throw @-@ throw , away . &quot;
&quot; yet , despite all efforts the report could only define two periods , where he was reported on the inter@@ vals on the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and was not responsible for the ex@@ its at a school , in which he was not effective and responsible , ( so the stuff ) did not hear anything but then again at 1993 . &quot;
closed Georg R@@ atz@@ inger before the states are consistently the ears ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : no , as in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Dom@@ Docum@@ ent@@ ym@@ n@@ asi@@ ums , which was even produced by the report . &quot;
&quot; in this , he pro@@ ves this to practice , that in the pre @-@ school will continue to practice the audi@@ t . &quot;
&quot; already in the face of the danger negative of the press Release , he received urg@@ ent inj@@ ection . &quot;
&quot; of course , that was of course at a time when the legal clarity was insi@@ sted as audi@@ ted in Bavaria too . &quot;
&quot; before , they say it in a legal gray @-@ zone , as each of us is still white . &quot;
there was also difficult for him to estimate where the affected may be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed and where really the per@@ mis@@ sible border had been exce@@ eded .
&quot; but you cannot say , but it always would have had . &quot;
this is simply not .
only in 1980 the test pun@@ ishment to schools were officially completed in Bavaria too .
&quot; princ@@ ess Gl@@ oria by Thur@@ n und Tax@@ is claimed yes , it was un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ agog@@ ical standards to the time . &quot;
how do you see that ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : we histori@@ ans are talking about the &quot; &quot; Fall@@ stri@@ ck of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; , &quot; thus the danger , last according to today &apos;s moral measure . &quot;
then the princ@@ ess has already been right .
&quot; but this is of course not true for sexual abuse , which was ab@@ omin@@ able at all times , and also not for what is the pre @-@ school of contradictions and violence in inno@@ cent child @-@ ri@@ mps , which goes far beyond that then practic@@ ing . &quot;
this is all very terrible and I am glad that it is finally recorded .
&quot; but at the same time , I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all that had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his resources for discipline and pun@@ ishment , so ear@@ ing and to pull in the hair and ears were widespread in the 19@@ 70s . &quot;
&quot; then , as a physical pun@@ ishment was then forbidden , he has also stri@@ ving them . &quot;
which image of his reign of time Georg R@@ atz@@ inger took back to you for the book &quot; My Br@@ brother of Pop@@ e &quot; ?
came the topic of test pot@@ atoes and language ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : well , in the book it comes to the life of his brother Joseph , so Pop@@ e Benedi@@ k@@ ts X@@ VII . , tells of his perspective , there were only a side @-@ roll . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I did not believe that he conducted a strict regi@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; but also this must be said again : without these perf@@ ection@@ ism , without these perf@@ ection@@ ery discipline , it would hardly be possible to form him rather national renowned Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen an institution of Wel@@ tran@@ g in Europe and its musical tradition which went straight twice in the US ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; bis@@ cuits and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone makes one of contradic@@ tory buttons , even though no big singer and in front of each success are equal to what area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
as what kind of people have you experienced by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger at their book ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : thanks to the work on the book and beyond that I experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well meet again and again as a wonderful , humor@@ ous , foundation , deep believ@@ ing and cordial people , from which one could not imagine that he could just do a fly . &quot;
&quot; I am regularly coming with how many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen is still today , 23 years after his em@@ eri@@ ation , regularly contact him to visit him , he is almost blind - and to treat it as a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who are not for@@ given him until today , that he once was strict to them , so are clearly in the minority . &quot;
most Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are grateful to him today that he enrich@@ ed their lives and have the world of music .
&quot; and that he is always a good , v@@ ä@@ ter@@ ly teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also an ad@@ orable Resp@@ ect@@ sper@@ son , to whom they still look at today , and which she seems to worship them today . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again clearly : everything we have thro@@ ws to him , instruc@@ tors , who were then at the time of the agenda . &quot;
we can be glad that we have long been overcome this time .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man , only because it is prominent and still a prominent brother has to make the medi@@ al scap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; there is the nasty int@@ ent that stands behind , just too appar@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; for the report , the report was released , di@@ schar@@ ged him . &quot;
&quot; now the an@@ chor@@ age would have acquired an 93 @-@ year man who has acquired great mer@@ its , and without the outside Bay@@ ern@@ s , and perhaps Germany probably no one would like to know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
