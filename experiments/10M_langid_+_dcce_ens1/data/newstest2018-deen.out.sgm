<seg id="76">"green surface care for a lot of work, a lot of nuts will be processed with the motor racing."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have to fight with the conditions and with topography," stressed Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003 he adopted the elterly operation and entertains this without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he does not lead a biobabrasion."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "the Commune has recognized the importance of the ordination."</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">"one hope that the scents of the areas could be gone out for a while." ""</seg>
<seg id="82">"the biggest treasure, we have the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how to continue their operations," stressed the Mayor. "</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers stand for the promotion of often in criticism</seg>
<seg id="84">There were a total of 25 plots of eleven participants in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The disclosure area is 40 hectares which can not be reforged by at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">"from the total costs of 71 500 Euro the half of 71 €was promoted about leader, a quarter trusted by the municipality of Fischbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"consequently, the farmers had to invest in 16,2 kilometres Weidezaun."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac betonte:" "you do a really good job, without farmers and landlady."</seg>

<seg id="96">The disclosure area corresponds 35 hectares which are calculated with more than 112 000 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">"now, the white house of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest character of a regime loss is it when they begin to attackdown the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans really value these equally like any other - hence the carefully insulated Sturz Saddam Hussel in Baghdad in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key-ideologists of Trump-regimes, certainly did what he did, when he was a symbolic Axt in a hitzky dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN on the proposals of the President to the drastic restriction of the legged immigration with the Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="102">"to remain fair, Miller is not the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of Bootsbitzers and Liberty-imators had made him lynn if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he attacked their meaning and especially the meaning that you wrote, when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after completion of the monument, its base has been added."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta:" I do not want to go on a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem that you refer to which later was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is objective, but as he himself is formulated, it is not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary resonance on the upright words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state would not only invites any old immigrants to breathe your arms, to breathe free to breathe free to breathe free of your poor."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "disgusting waste" on our screens was better to see.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller engaged not in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural struggle: it is indeed a conflict for the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and their friends who set up their words after their death at the base - did not know that they had a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between the French and American Republicism by putting them in an abused classical image representation the female embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - it has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the Exilanten.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist Coup and a devastating attack on American Natimus.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just like Lazarus, the importance of the statue, people wanted to change the people from right wing this long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great scribe Rush Limpergh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming from Trump, argumented in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was progressing, but rather an early neoconicative, which the American flame is moving into the umnafied world:" Lady Liberty is moving forward. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It is supposed to wear the torches of the freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not shine the way into the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Rather unusual is Limpergh here on something to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of the statue is entirely and certainly a matter of underpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative fact of Lazarus consisted to see them as they were from the exhaustive, elitting, but hopeless people after long and often terrible trips on the decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"it is in the truest sense that the world from the perspective of people see, refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the will.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this is of course not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever appreciate.</seg>
<seg id="127">"your fackel should not enlighten the way, but the hatred, who is their only source of power, ignite."</seg>
<seg id="128">Worldchampionship 2017: Neil Black loves Scottish members of the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle reminds of a time when only two Schotten to the team of Great Britain</seg>

<seg id="134">I speak with people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes, medals are medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew ButMegMDH - which was elected by Sir Mon Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team to team's team."</seg>
<seg id="140">"iliie is rather modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"their capitalists were unbelievable," says Black. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, no matter whether they were scrutable or wherever they live or train, they went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the real feel, the Eiliie had completely natural, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth-Silbermedallists who will join in their fifth world championships at the 400-m-hurdles, says that it is" unbelievable "that 16 Scots are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's far the best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, the 1983 and 2015 were achieved. "</seg>
<seg id="146">The mid-streetched Muir leads along this path and has drawn up five British and two European recruit last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will participate in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m length."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m is another verrot, which one should look after a great season, which should be watching the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">"Doyle was reminded of their first world championships, as the only other sotte in the Team Lee McConnell."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the crests capitals says that they are" enormous proud "" of the fact that many of their farmers do not only belong to the team, but in some cases even with the medals and in the Finals. "</seg>
<seg id="151">"what particular team-capitals to be in it is that they have chosen by the other members of the team so that it anyway be a great honour, but to know that my team mates for me and have chosen to do something very special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It shows only how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as established athletes, athletes, who want to rise on Podiums."</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech is concerned about capital?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think they went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to put on this home assistance and benefit from it that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I got a second chance to go there and compete and it will simply be as a great atmosphere there.</seg>
<seg id="160">Block from critics on Facebook: apply you not for a public post when you can not wear the use of sculptors</seg>
<seg id="161">The Father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't last long until the newspapers took him because of the internal policy to its political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">He sweeps in criticism, safe. "</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not put his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"for in the year 1783 said Washington:" "freedom of expression can be taken away - and, duous and stumm we are led as the sheep for battles."</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work on it to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogan employee have been blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and have been deleted that their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union pleaded him in the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the stick of the governor sent the lawsuit as frivol, and the online comment was full of a reaction with" Na, and? "</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is just Facebook," said many people. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important if it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second part of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a fixed hand on the leadership of his state and strict compliance with principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very sent to use Facebook as a prick means to connect with its sculptors and play his hair-less head to chemotherapy in his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blockages of individuals who are coming to the side of the Governor - which is a public forum that is paid as a officially and by employees that are paid by public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post Corrupted Hogan, Amelia Chasse the actions of the governor, and argumed that the blocking of the comments has nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">"but it is too simple to use the image of breastfeeding or spammers or hate people, which goes online the whip."</seg>
<seg id="181">"the Post spoke with some of the real people, which were blocked by Hogan."</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, not a trolle."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profan."</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastel zipped the Bible in his post and appellied to Hogan Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani by Bowie, MD., was not hate, but she asked after hassins."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented polite, that I was disappointed that there was no response to Hasshirechen and another current news," she wrote in the commentary area of the news "The Post." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I appreciate this idea even if a number of people on the same subject takes position, then they are more widely accepted by some more than a so called" "collective commitment and not considered a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the employees of the Governor as" focused spam-attack "would like other probably" interactions. ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"the Facebook-era makes it simple to cut a message by simply block a critics or is deleted or a negative comment is deleted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in early time, if one had done the same that staff were sent to collect newspapers with critical tails, and to burn or demonstrating or demonstrating or disassemble to silence."</seg>
<seg id="191">But precisely this is just digital.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public officials who has criticised for it on Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is accused by Twitter-users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>

<seg id="196">And in Kentucky received governor Matt population (R) also a visit to the ACLU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>

<seg id="1320">"before, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I sought after something, that was comparable to my price."</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I loves me in them and made this day an offer. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit the 1,000 square feet tall apartment has been completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a dirty layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to use Joanne Stauraum and a mezzanine to make the spacious ceiling height optimally.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted a high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"this was my request," says it. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, they commissioned the Architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, which was 12.5 feet high ceilings and a home to create, not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the blanket was not big enough to place two rooms, so that the architectonic challenge is insisted to create a mezzanine in which one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creative to solve the task.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," explained. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the spaces so easily, that they were overflowing with each other, without having had to gaps."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not just about to build a simple platform, but the steel that he had the right height for the function or down the right height."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement allowed the Erfan to place two rooms in full altitude - with a lot of extra drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine looks a classic copper-light window of retrouvius via the glamorous design.</seg>
<seg id="1336">"embroidery Goldmaker, silberne Akzente and Vintage Serge Mouille's illumination set the style for the program."</seg>

<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the mirror feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance we offer a piper unit room for all bricks and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">"due to the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can shut the kitchen if it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">What is special about this is that it is a guarantor.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineers went out into," explains Erfan from the steel strengthened, furnified MDF door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is opposite, so it is when you slide the door high slide, very easily glides."</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clevering use of space and storage space could win extra 16 m ² to extra bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the property, or how your property is appreciated," "says Erfan."</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form a real estate makler comes, and make a calculation based on the floor size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here they have managed to enlarge the floor space, and at the same time use high quality materials used to get to the room its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things that they touch and that can therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," "says Erfan."</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you do not love yourself into the electrical sockets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">"these are important, but they do not play with your heart."</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself by good design and increased square metabby of something by default into something totally amazing.</seg>

<seg id="1394">"as John F. Kelly, the new Stabschef of the White House, at his first working day, he set a major problem in President Donald Trumps white house, which he repaired us: bad information that is used in the hands of the President."</seg>

<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials say that Trump as a volcano is able to react to a negative freedom of press, especially such with corrupted Lecco, and that he fell asleep."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"exactly that came to pass at the end of February, when somebody came to the president of GotNews.com, the website of the internet-provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who were the Deputy-schefin Katie Walsh," the Source behind a heap of Lecco "in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">Though Johnson was founded on Twitter because of suikans permanently removed from Twitter or that he has no concrete proof or that he has expressed false proposals in the past.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started to deal with staff about Walsh.</seg>

<seg id="1810">"the staff of the Weekly Riodoce normally meet, to check their plans for the reporting of the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and unenlightened drug."</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-level journalists will discuss what safer feels more secure: you should take their children with the office, which were the target of an attack with grants, or they can be home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"unsusdared have three words on one table on the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the reporters, names for each column - no evidence is needed, perceptions and abdominal cavity."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drugs, politicians, politicians, businessmen, journalists, who are condemned to stand on the other side of the government or the box, a catalog of breeders that make the chaos of Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no herds of violence, and while throughout the country the corpses, are more and more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took place in December 2012. 589 are after attacked and threats under federal protection and up now there were at least seven dead in seven states."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"under the latter, its publisher and inspirator of Riodoce, the co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest error is to live in Mexico and will be a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence associated with drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"its absence will be deeply felt, although his presence everywhere is present - a big photo of Valdez, which shows his mid-finger with the word" "Justice", "hanging at the façade of the Riodoce building." two reporter in the three-three years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing T-shirts that have his ridiculous face with glasses or its typical Panamahut. "</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop will take place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared subjects, trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although in 2010 it was established an on-government agency to edit the cases of journalists, this is initiated according to the Committee for journalists only to the protection of journalists only two penalties."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most thousands of Morden, each year are linked to drug additive and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are only rarely provided in court."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodoce still, they are still to treat the violence of Sinaloa, although they are unobserving and although the terrain is now even stronger."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for discussion of safety, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid, my time in this workshop," says he. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we do not know the Why, we mistaken all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"in the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the provincial capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he made it only to drive a few blocks, before his red Toyota Corolla was raised by two men. he was taken from his car and 12 times was fined to him, probably due to the name of the newspaper - which is translated using" "twelve river". ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The prest went away from his car and damaged it in the vicinity.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumours to be free in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But at Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzmans revenge last year and delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa had become one of the blutigest battleties of the country, since riveting fractions are fighting here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it does not make any thing that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people on the street are shot or that the cemetery is full of complicated, two-story Mausoleums for Drogenria, which are bigger than many houses for living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">"forget for a minute that there is a state of" peace "," if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its precious ports and drugs of commercial countries in the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work is Mr. Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the blame that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first, in February the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of rivaling cartoons in war with Guzmans sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have withered the sons, suspected hallways: each copy of the issue, as soon as it has been delivered to time-kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second fault was to force that Valdez did not force, after confiscation of another newspaper, which had the same story to leave the land to its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists. "</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had so long survived that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He was active in 2003 as an experienced reporter for Noroeste when he joined with five colleagues in the creation of Riodoce and 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa, it was impossible to operate journalism without encounter the predowry problem, said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"with the time the newspaper earned a reputation because of courageous and honest reporting, and revenue and advertising."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved it to publish hard helpers with no fear of censorship, and the readers were intrigued from a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else could treat."</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodoce she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" for their reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez has won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the committee for the protection of journalists in persecution of Mexican Drug history, wherever it led."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He was voluntarily said that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue to live," he said at the time of the CPJ Award. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"Drug trade in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You must assume the task that falls you as a journalist - either that or you play the dums.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"I would not like to be asked:" "what did you do in the face of so many dead... why have you not told what happened before?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team will miss Valdez, the Spaetbird, who was like a port workers, the friend, the generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survived."</seg>
<seg id="1857">She trusted on his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always sit down to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, go and sit there at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"well, ask them: was his love for routine to be stoves?"</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death also has to forced them to ask their own assumptions about it, how to do their work best and remain in life."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they do not like it with their wives, their children, their cleaned shops, her beadly start and farways to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-determination and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">His own instincts trust.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it is wrong, stay away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"anger is, said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal that" smell is a sense that can be changed... and then the thing happened to Javier. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, in Sinaloa no longer - just like in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, in which a toxic mix of lucrative smugly, weak institutions and corrupt officials."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the room, where the staff of Riodoce came to the security training, were suddenly no phones allowed. days before has been known that Spyware that is exclusively used to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">"outside, two policemen protect against the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree."</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the federal government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story area in a mid-class quarter of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"and half in a joke, some of the reporters, whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of policemen, who belong to the Governor itself as not trustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it's months ago since the reporters went out into the mountain region, where the drug adures de facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week Riodoce has been stretched on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former known Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an expose to the citizenship that was concentrated on the hometown of the governor.</seg>

<seg id="1881">Recently several pri-governors were humbled because of high-cardiac cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal bat acquainted the reporter, including previous incidents in this local, including one where a son of" El Chapo "" was decided by military consideration. "</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months ago the reader would have seen the Columns of Valdez as the best informed source of the kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"earlier we would have already knew what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "" El FLACO "because of its slender body temperature."</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now, all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"the office of Valdez has become a storage room for characters and stickers that have become sick against the murder of journalists, because the employees have become something that they had never expected, activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">"Reporse Miriam Ramirez, a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalists in the office of the Prosecution."</seg>

<seg id="1893">She has since then asked that she was once more divided by the government because it is worried that their anger is violated their objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico by organised crime, involved in government agencies and a uniform society." "</seg>
<seg id="1895">"his last book" Narco-Journalism "he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug additives, but also on the command of politicians and security forces, with organised crime under a ceiling."</seg>

<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic, the suspended plant-eaters is the best preserved fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk when he was on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something that appeared from the surrounding rocks at the Platze, and decided to look more detailed in more detail."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil was sent to him in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaces.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"you spent the next six years to cover the wild animal in the 2.500 pounds (1.100 kg) of heavy natural clubs."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all of these hard work, the finished product is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only have a little with the eyes flink, you could almost believe that it slept, said the main writer Caleb Brown, scientists at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature has to be seen."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it is considered to be one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs, the Mona Lisa the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this species was covered, although he is covered with a armor and a changing tanks, probably was threatened by meat sofresher dinosaurs. "</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the strong arossed dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide from precipitation, and used a shielding technology that is known as opposing technology, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have been allowed to develop better in its surroundings and to spread it to its enemies, say experts, which suggests that it was threatened by major dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of the Nodosaurs took place in May for the first time and is now at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaea.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers now study the wild animal study and it was called Borealopelta marked with the Museumstengineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to cover it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed the Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of shed and armor about his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the condusting, a widespread defence method in the animal world, which means the tip of the creature dark was as their underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the conshady is common, the results are surprising when the size of Borealopelta is far from the today living animals survived."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it indicates that the dinosaurs have had enough pressure through the flesh of fresco dinosaurs, that the evolution of the confrontation of confrontation as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most of the contemporary animals that condull use - think of Rbefore, Zebras or belt - are much smaller and more hurting than loot that was exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predatory behaviour on a massive, strong arossed dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs have had to have been said," "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaurs-brown was.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to investigate the animal on references about his life including his complimentary intestine to figure out what it has eaten when his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, into a river and carried out into the sea where he sank down on the back to the sea."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time Alberta was so warm like southern floral today, and rivers and oceans are likely a lot more widespread than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurs is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with preservented skin, but also in three dimensions, and the original shape of the beast, said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal today looks almost as much as in the early chalk time.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you do not need a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. if you just have a little with the eyes shine, you could almost believe that he is at sleep."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the chalk time was a time when huge theropods, fleshy dinosaurs, which were on two legs, the earth were crossed."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, millions of years after Borealopelta lived, the armored dinosaurs was numbered by some of his fearful ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this belongs to the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11,5 m) long, six tons weighted monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">Scientists to appear their most recent findings in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was transferred to the death in the sea and mud in mud. "</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk when he was on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum it is the bestered dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from the muzzle up to the hips."</seg>

<seg id="2038">They booked a return trip and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 23 am she took her 6-year old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two next morning we would drive to Ferguson.</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the subject of a new documentary," Whose Streets? "" in the chin from the 11. "</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a history of survival and Protestant, the love and loss of loss that exists in the population of the people who live in the community and filled the streets to ask answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as Ferrell with her daughter, who carried a flowers and a suitable crown, after Ferguson, the two a conversation that they had countless times before this morning" about the black experience and the black condition. "</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I taught you, when black people have to fight for what they believe?" he remembered what she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2044">We now go to Ferguson because the police have killed a 18-year-old boy and that was not right.</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take them," said Ferrell later. "</seg>
<seg id="2046">What happened today is a highlight of... what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know and see it and being raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it needs to be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I have the luck to give her an experience in which they are not experienced eklatly racism, it is not different from the next black women-child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I have the feeling, I would prove their bad service to keep them off."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first stop when they arrived in Ferguson, there was at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authorities, which was the activists in the possible non-prosecution by Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there, Ferrell and her daughter have joined a local business partners, who made lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags in front of and halves to admit them on protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly I began to take a new kind of activism to Ferrell's shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism is completely changed after the 9th of August, she said and noticed that she was at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health equalities in black communities."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organising.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It is all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later Ferrell arrived in Ferrell during an evening-demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-director of the film. "</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said, she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to document" "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came to Ferrell in the meaning:" "you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"these scepticism was fed by countless cases of people, often from pastor in a community that benefited by their pain and its resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"like Folayan recently said in an interview:" "we had heard that people who have born in Ferguson and raised their voices, and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field which is known for his activism. "</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his involvement brought Ferrell the project closer together with six other locals followed the team of" Whose Streets? "in the years after Browse Erinduction."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us. we speak," said Davis. "</seg>
<seg id="2066">"this was the main thing for me how these people are represented, because I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to focus on Ferrells's experience - to show that it comes to the movement" not about a Messiah leader, but about a community that comes together, "said Folayan - she proved to be the revealed-in of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"they show documents of" Whose Streets? "surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells's life, as they love and married her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed, when she saw the finished product for the first time. "</seg>
<seg id="2070">"but I understood that it has to give a certain vulnerability at this work, and in the crazement of black people."</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferris history, the role of the black rails women in the broader Black-Lives-Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, which are characterised by killing of the Black Teenage Trayvon Martin in 2012 the film" BlacklivesMatter "in social media, identify themselves as pregnant."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, swts women in leadership-positions have worn the movement altogether," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting in various fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must be the main last of all."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to notice that" the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women. "</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it is that" "this is not a affirmatical type of action," which was selected to Ferrell because of its identity as the heart of the movie. "</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who opened this energy, she said."</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no coincidence, although it was on the front front, because with a life on these crosses as a black, rails woman is so much on the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"in the meantime the news-mates in Ferguson has long gone, but the racial connections between the church and the police are still living."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on nutrition for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a highway on a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">"it describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the area, which she called her home:" a mess. "</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless, it complained to a vocals and she feels committed to this memory, since then three years ago in Ferguson went on the road."</seg>
<seg id="2084">"it is our duty, to fight for our freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>

<seg id="2089">"the bit-gallery moves the people, although it is not yet built for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a mall on the south side of the pedestrian zone has since the first presentation of 2009 the population in advocates and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold is hardly leaves a problem.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Also on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg" will be discussed on our Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while the one to say to the bit gallery:" that would be a dream "(Anja Becker) or" That would be real "" (Nicole newspaper), comes from the other hand: "" be no man "" (Siggi Bets) or quite simple: "" size "" (Lars Scholz). "</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the advocates that a gallery will take more customers in the city, of which the remaining businesses will benefit, feared the opponents that then the pedestrian street."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"to add: the gallery will be planned exactly on the property, on which the peasantry opens, in which 13 directors marketed their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">With the beginning of the construction work will be the end.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Galerie's Macher want to integrate the market hall in the new building - namely to Beda-Square with the possibility to sitting outside sitting.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Rooms: "we have worked almost weekly in the farmhouse market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mostly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the countryside always like to be very happy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Also the butcher-ei we have discovered for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">"we would like to wish, that even during and above all the gallery of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer."</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"in particular, the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting."</seg>
<seg id="2104">"Gerd Densing:" "whether direct markers at a market hall in the gallery, comes to the amount of rent."</seg>
<seg id="2105">"however, it is probably not just too low in the new project."</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what shopping in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"clothing, shoes, iron, or supermarkets. I find this superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">One sees how many stores are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since there is not even yet another weekly market, it is so important that at least the market hall stays at least."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"because after all, the goods offered there is fresh, mostly offered from the producer and is obendlessly clean."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"how one sees, stores in a shopping center just by major companies, for the dormitory tenants are often not transferable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"too bad, specialty shops are almost no more and what still left, will probably still disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a mall with the market hall fits me together.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where should the peasant strikes during the construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even on the duration when the bit gallery will actually come.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does it already create the Geskarst Bit gallery prior to distribute all the shops from Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "this is simply not going to work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center, which is empty, also does nobody need."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"but for a farmhouse, there are many - like I find - meaningless constructions in Bitburg is no place thanks to the well-less construction projects in Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the farmhouse market is broken, again a piece of culture will disappear."</seg>

<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Polka... and Haarausages that have been sent by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former secret service analyst was a 35-year-old sentence has publicly made as secret diplomatic reports on the website WikiLeaks."</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition which opened on 2 August is now called Becoming resemblance (A suitable similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">"it is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline was transformed into technology, computer sciences and art, and Manning, a transwoman and groundbreaking dissively, whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg has created by the algorithm analysis of the DNA, which could be created by Manning, and out of the 30 portraits, such as someone can be interpreted with these genomic data - the many ways, as they may be interpreted and the infient determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning that was born as Bradley Edward, but has already talked about the identify as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced as six passages against the Spionagegesetz, Computerbeth and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"through the prison her picture suppressed, so much that there was only a single picture - a grained, black-white Selfie, in which Manning is sitting at ease on a roadside and a platinblonde perch - with which it was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg straight from the great success of their 2012-project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in this produced the artist of strangers from forensic Artefakas such as cigarette stony and gum rubberty, by adding the DNA from the waste in order to produce a picture of how these people could look like."</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a timagazin.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they held an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg with a press release of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not visit this time and she could not photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea, and asked whether she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"the artists and their arielded muse were forced to unequal Bribles, who have several letters in the course of two years."</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created one of Shoili Kanungo illustrated Comic" Suppressed Images "which would prevail a future in which the President Chelseas would be able to see the exhibition in person."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was released after seven brutal years after seven brutal years, was a welcome type of happy incidence."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is now also in the opening of the exhibition some deployed and Starkes, da Donald Trump leads to war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweeter spells that he should actually fix, further to compensate."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"as Dewey-Hagborg after the weird timing of all these things, she said that" "things happen out of a particular reason." ""</seg>

<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall is its mitochondrival DNA sequence - a thousand-sequence of Cs and Gs and As, in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped by integrating the 200 characters (or Nucleotide after the high-developed scientific Lexikon of the artist), how much are similar, at least in biological way we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully bring about it is that our genome is not to take care of who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA-data can tell so many different stories, so that are 30 of these stories."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in an own room is one side from the above mentioned Comic Novelle."</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning as they appeared with a free-speaking one in the hand of the Disciplash of the United States like King-Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they address your talk, then they won," says it. "</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so never forget the mouth." ""</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came straight from a letter that she wrote me," said the artist who greet from Philadelphia. "</seg>
<seg id="2153">"I still get goose, when I talk about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not yet seen the exhibition - as it was predicted in the Comicbook - but if they should do it, then it will be greeted in the middle of the room of masks which meet like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also focused on how everything was written in the exhibition, up to the size (5" 2, Mannings Stature), in which its genetic Haploggroups have been written. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted to feel like a crowds," said Dewey-Hagborg from the portrait. "</seg>

<seg id="2291">In his younger past the small Scotney Castle was seen in a Squeeze music video and was a margarter for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-1980 and 1980-30s.</seg>
<seg id="2292">"but Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history of its cozy seat at the Guardian River Valley in Kent and is now for inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaipee Yorkur with a preference for historical documents."</seg>

<seg id="2294">"what a personal relationship, this letter to keep in my hand."</seg>
<seg id="2295">"a Castle in England 'embraced the time from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. each story was illustrated by another, rising British artists - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"it is not the first book of Rhodes, which is based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpected."</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I have only written on the thumbs on the side of a letter that has been written in the 1700's, who worked for the Jacobins," says he. "</seg>

<seg id="2310">"some of the stories in the collection uses the castle as a starting point to enter into the English history, including 'The Labourer', which is a man follows that the newly built castle leaves to join the peasantry of 1381."</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a rebellion which occurred 1380 in the castle, in this book with the title 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes. "</seg>

<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, emerizing professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must start to take their rise seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the message of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingers."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make yourself funny, but the companies provide lots of them from, and we will still see much more common to see," said Mr. Sharkey in the release of his new report. "</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpups have developed themselves from its inflatable partners to robots with a silicon that feels warm and feels with aware of human reactions that can be achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can also customize its robots, according to his beliefs" and to choose everything, from the eyes of the robot to the type of breast warts up to the type or color of his fingers. "</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it will still be disturbing, as many robots possess the" "personalities" "which would be a steppe-woman would look like."</seg>

<seg id="2418">Keep your builders that they feel human to make the movement of a real body Nachahmen.</seg>

<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to create the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said," We have a connection between a bacterium art - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestine microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that encourage tolerance to promote tolerance. "</seg>

<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component was cleaned from the fluid, it proved to be a by-product of Tryptophan-Metabolism, which is known as an inol-3-militaric acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"when the researchers have doubled the amount of Tryptophan in the food of mice, the number of such cells increased by approximately 50 percent, but when the tryptopical values have been decreased, decreased the number of cells around half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tenance-promoting cells such as mice and that most of us L. reuteri in our stomach-intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether Tryptophan-by L. reuteri, the cells in people develop as with mice, but defects in genes in relation to Tryptophan were found in people with anti-inflammatory gimeration."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said:" "the development of these cells is probably something that we would like to promote, since these cells will control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine."</seg>

<seg id="2896">"the habit, the Catholic Church as a source of all practicing, is already part of the daily experience, and prepare the public opinion that is intended for normal," writes Scaraffia. "</seg>
<seg id="2897">Princess Gloria by Thurn und Taxis said in an interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk: "we like to go to the church and that is a fallen frescoes.</seg>
<seg id="2898">"in addition, they pointed out that in her youth" "saw a very normal pedagogical means" "to be with naughty children as I was one."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"they inars it unfair, present standards for earlier decades, because the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports on the misused waste often also Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"totally to wrong, the author and historian Michael Hesemann, who was translated with Ratzinger the reminder" My Brother "of Pope" "(in 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I must take Georg Ratzinger in Cover," says Hesemann, "" for all that had nothing to do with him, "the results of the final reported."</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report that was commissioned by the diocese Regensburg with the Enlightenment attorney Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"total 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were born between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" with high plausibility. "</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report, it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who was active in Regensburg on 1964 till 1994 in Regensburg:" in a summary, that by Domkapellmeister R. have been applied by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases of physical and psychological violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially at high ennoonality, the punishment could also fall off for the pupils at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, unlike many other prosects that many victims are estimated that many victims are estimated and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview Hesemann is explained why the final report for misuse scandal with the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger took his opinion after discharged.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-pages report on the "" Incidents "" on protagonists at the Regensburger Domspatzen "" gives a contradictory image of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger. "</seg>
<seg id="2910">For a lift many students say his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">"he also appears as a choleriker and perfectionist, who made the öfteren, if a domrighteous was musically no top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you think as his biographer this concluding?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: when you read the trouble and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back, one has to ask yourself, why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all in it. "</seg>
<seg id="2914">It is dedicated even eight sides and he is clearly talked about any suspicion of the media- or co-workers with the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Also the impacts at the forefront of the school was beyond its efficiency.</seg>
<seg id="2916">You can decide to know about it or have not taken seriously enough of them or have taken their first postponies seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the spatzengymnville, on which he was realized by practically all respondents as - as literally -" salvation, "" heaven "and" better world "." "</seg>
<seg id="2918">"so also the vast majority of his pupils Georg Ratzinger puts a very excellent result," "sincere," "sincerely," "competent," "sincerely," "sincerely," "competent", "and" understandable "," who supplemed the guys regularly with cakes, biscuits and Bonbons and "always of grapes from children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority is worth about his perfectionism, and its high turbulality, which also led to wolves."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"that he did not only cast with some chairs and put the keychain on the ground, but also pointed out guys to the hair or ears he already gave himself to the hair, deeply regret and excused for them."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"to his honesty must be said however, that such investigations must be widespread in the fragile period, the 1960s and 1970s, which were widespread in parents like in teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such a Breeding-methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think everyone of us who was born in 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"also I have experienced this in a world-secular school, a state Gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what it is actually going on this report, namely the placeable sexual abuse and of non-violence, are the free of Bagatellen."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"if you ask yourself, whether it is no more likely to do with his familiarity and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI. that many media has just returned to him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"in the Bavarian pope, many who have never understood him, still eager."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report entlastet Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">The media has been reported much about the subject of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger in the Final Report as well as any implication or co-workers with regard to sexual abuse at the burden?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">None of 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have familiar with the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I never drew me to speak with my father or my mother who said," "said," "said, I was very embarrassing for the others," "It happened to me everything very embarrassing."</seg>
<seg id="2935">"the true issue in the enlightenment of sexual abuse was, and is that most victims was silence."</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they were not even parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral conductor, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators we have been a colleague of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen's pupils rate role in terms of misuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student formulated it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he could have had their own findings and could have been stopped the respective perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I think it... also for really absurd, imagine it... replicate and clearer or more likely to have opened, as opposed to their parents, internet access, confidence etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"thus, the report comes to the very clear result:" that in the field of affected students and / or their environment, he could not be confirmed in the scope of the investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="2942">What sexual abuse is concerned about Georg Ratzinger is thus to speak of any co-workers.</seg>
<seg id="2943">"so, it cannot be thrown into him, not prevented him or have brought to the ad."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore there is no reason to bring his good name with these contradictory crime, as unfortunately in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media was a lot of "nonviolence" to read in the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger will be thrown into the report. "</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in reporting everything mixed and blended up to a huge melange made of sexual abuse and violence, and somewhere, in the middle of, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is again a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"it is completely separated from: between the pre-school and the Gymnasium of Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence, as well as, let's say, other appealing."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report also deals with accidents in the period since 1945, therefore also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not Chorus of the cathedral spatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"all terrible conditions of pedagogy, the cases, in which flaws of sadistic teachers were scrupulated and Maltese, who have been ruled to the forefathers in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have to be ruled."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with them Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys only to face, when they had already been on the domain."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on that was, as the most witnesses emphasize the theme of" pre-school "tabu."</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to escape you and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "heavenly" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the cathedral-insurances?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was already discipline, but just no sadistic violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2958">"and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, where the report comes to the conclusion that" many victims are estimated and therefore often positive memories with him in many cases. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"so, at the most remains the throw-throw, away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"yet, despite all efforts the report could only define two periods, where he was reported on the intervals on the pre-school."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and was not responsible for the exits at a school, in which he was not effective and responsible, (so the stuff) did not hear anything but then again at 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Closed Georg Ratzinger before the states are consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, as in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the DomDocumentymnasiums, which was even produced by the report."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this, he proves this to practice, that in the pre-school will continue to practice the audit."</seg>
<seg id="2965">"already in the face of the danger negative of the press Release, he received urgent injection."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"of course, that was of course at a time when the legal clarity was insisted as audited in Bavaria too."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before, they say it in a legal gray-zone, as each of us is still white."</seg>
<seg id="2968">There was also difficult for him to estimate where the affected may be exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permissible border had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">"but you cannot say, but it always would have had."</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the test punishment to schools were officially completed in Bavaria too.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"princess Gloria by Thurn und Taxis claimed yes, it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the time."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we historians are talking about the "" Fallstrick of Anachronism "," thus the danger, last according to today's moral measure. "</seg>
<seg id="2975">Then the princess has already been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but this is of course not true for sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times, and also not for what is the pre-school of contradictions and violence in innocent child-rimps, which goes far beyond that then practicing."</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all very terrible and I am glad that it is finally recorded.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time, I have to take Georg Ratzinger, because all that had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his resources for discipline and punishment, so earing and to pull in the hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"then, as a physical punishment was then forbidden, he has also striving them."</seg>
<seg id="2981">Which image of his reign of time Georg Ratzinger took back to you for the book "My Brbrother of Pope"?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Came the topic of test potatoes and language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it comes to the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedikts XVII., tells of his perspective, there were only a side-roll."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I did not believe that he conducted a strict regiment."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but also this must be said again: without these perfectionism, without these perfectionery discipline, it would hardly be possible to form him rather national renowned Regensburger Domspatzen an institution of Weltrang in Europe and its musical tradition which went straight twice in the US (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"biscuits and Bonbons alone makes one of contradictory buttons, even though no big singer and in front of each success are equal to what area, but always discipline, passion and self-sufficiency."</seg>
<seg id="2987">As what kind of people have you experienced by Georg Ratzinger at their book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: thanks to the work on the book and beyond that I experienced Georg Ratzinger really well meet again and again as a wonderful, humorous, foundation, deep believing and cordial people, from which one could not imagine that he could just do a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I am regularly coming with how many former Domspatzen is still today, 23 years after his emeriation, regularly contact him to visit him, he is almost blind - and to treat it as a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who are not forgiven him until today, that he once was strict to them, so are clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domspatzen are grateful to him today that he enriched their lives and have the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he is always a good, väterly teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also an adorable Respectsperson, to whom they still look at today, and which she seems to worship them today."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again clearly: everything we have throws to him, instructors, who were then at the time of the agenda."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long been overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust, a man, only because it is prominent and still a prominent brother has to make the medial scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the nasty intent that stands behind, just too apparent."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, the report was released, discharged him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the anchorage would have acquired an 93-year man who has acquired great merits, and without the outside Bayerns, and perhaps Germany probably no one would like to know the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
