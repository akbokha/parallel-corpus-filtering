Gol@@ fer L@@ anger receives the Sport@@ pyram@@ id
his experiences on the horse are over@@ spect@@ able .
at the end of a golf tur@@ ni@@ ers in South Africa su@@ dden Bernhard L@@ anger with some colleagues a bit of di@@ version with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CHI@@ O : &quot; Golden Sport@@ pyram@@ id &quot; for Bernhard L@@ anger
after a few minutes the horses in her work evening they hunt at the fast g@@ op@@ p home to the feed @-@ teeth .
&quot; a few kilometers at this pace , I have had fear . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says L@@ anger . &quot;
and so the riding ap@@ pren@@ tices again ended again .
on Saturday the best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament looks - again near horses .
&quot; he left with his family on the plant of AL@@ RV on a horse , he did not swing with photo . &quot;
&quot; long , the first time in Aachen and therefore with CHI@@ O . &quot;
the reason was quite convinc@@ ing .
the German Sp@@ orth@@ ilfe is over the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small Gala the Gol@@ den@@ e Sport@@ pyram@@ id .
we are not sh@@ ining it to the lik@@ eable ath@@ let@@ e .
&quot; Berlin , Hor@@ nes Lei@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen already made him ad@@ orable .
long is the 18th prize of the Sport@@ pyram@@ id .
in Aachen he met the first winners Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; this award means a lot , &quot; says L@@ anger , &quot; because it is not just awarded for sport@@ ing suc@@ cesses , but also for soci@@ ally commitment . &quot;
for decades L@@ anger encour@@ ages the offspring .
&quot; and so he also gave the prize money of 25@@ ,000 euros equal . &quot;
&quot; with 15 additional remarkable sport , the two @-@ Master Master@@ s@@ bur@@ i was added to the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of the German Sports . &quot; &quot;
&quot; among the excellent include the ath@@ letes , Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Sch@@ mitt , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ ve , the ro@@ wing of Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob @-@ driver Mein@@ hard N@@ aut@@ a , the Spring@@ d Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ ö@@ hle , and pos@@ uction on the hand of all Er@@ hard mir@@ acles . &quot;
many of these sports @-@ leg@@ ends were come on Saturday after Aachen .
&quot; after the official part the illustr@@ ated society went into the Spring@@ stage , where the Lav@@ az@@ za @-@ Preis ran . &quot;
Bernhard L@@ anger held distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tru@@ mps Economic Policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
we invest in infrastructure and to prevent the trade agreement T@@ TP - they want to do both Clinton and Tru@@ mp .
&quot; however , the two US pres@@ idential elections are among the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question . &quot;
&quot; the differences in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosoph@@ ical difference . &quot;
the role of the state .
Tru@@ mp wants to keep in doubt rather small and war@@ ns before that the state of economy can harm - with taxes and regulatory .
&quot; Clinton wants to reg@@ ulate the economy to death , he says . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , it would be quite different , claims Tru@@ mp . &quot;
he will return me@@ at@@ ings and he turns strong up for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower wheel@@ chairs strongly - for professionals and for companies .
&quot; Clinton against it says : the state has certain duties to fulfill , he has a dis@@ advantage opportunities to open and needs money . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the taxes would be increased for the rich , says it . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; to be invested in the rivers , say Tru@@ mp and Clinton is almost superf@@ icial . &quot;
the democratic applic@@ ant anno@@ unces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
&quot; &quot; &quot; state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic politics and are rej@@ ected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ at@@ y @-@ wing of the Republi@@ can . &quot;
&quot; thus , in Tru@@ mp , they could still have part@@ ying discussions too . &quot;
significant are the differences in energy and climate policy .
Tru@@ mp wants to build char@@ coal and coal promotion in the USA again .
&quot; oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas , the Paris climate protection wants to cancel it . &quot;
Clinton wants to build renewable energy costs with their investment program and demands : &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of the clean@@ ses energies and millions of jobs .
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
&quot; however , not only in the infrastructure - even at international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far away from each other . &quot;
&quot; TP@@ P , the transp@@ azi@@ fic trade agreements , they both do not want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both but they do not want to isol@@ ate the US for international trade - but just American jobs . &quot;
the should then also be paid better than Clinton .
the current wag@@ lo@@ hn from 7,@@ 25 US dollars was a fam@@ ine .
she wants to increase it on 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tru@@ mp does not want to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum stay , then he says he might not be changed . &quot;
yet the major discussion of the coming months may well be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand , Tru@@ mp , who wants to rel@@ ieve the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot;
his cri@@ tics hold him before so that the household de@@ ficit would only be greater .
&quot; Clinton at the other side is Clinton , who wants at least demand for the rich that they pay more taxes , and their cri@@ tics say : more taxes are also not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; every run@@ ner woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence is one of women who fle@@ e alone , almost already for everyday life . &quot;
&quot; if they arrive in Germany , they are often traumatic . &quot;
a house offers re@@ fuge .
in a large kitchen sit four women .
each has a baby that is at most one year old .
one has laid her little son in the arm .
he gu@@ ess with great eyes curious in the room .
his mother rigi@@ d on the tab@@ let@@ op .
until they notice that it is observed .
she sm@@ iled short and kis@@ sed the glue .
the scene plays normal .
until one speaks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is the area of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier of social assistance in Bavaria , and deals with the topic of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are refugees
they live in the Mün@@ chner north of one of the few de@@ centr@@ alized accommodations for all @-@ f@@ enced women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs made the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Mün@@ chner Stadt@@ enh@@ ilfe .
un@@ long she has been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men are not there - also not as a visitor .
the exception is a wax@@ man in front of the door .
&quot; it is not ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated to say : every woman who comes here , has made their escape experience with sexual violence , says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men fle@@ e because of wars , because they are political pursu@@ ed because of them tort@@ ure or death , or because their families would like to send them as a hopes for Europe , &quot; &quot; tells them . &quot;
&quot; in women , other reasons for the flight : &quot; many ste@@ aling themselves secre@@ tly , because they do not see any other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their homeland they have experience with sexual violence , ob@@ sessive , hon@@ ors , sla@@ very , sla@@ very , or forced constitution . &quot;
this drives them away .
on the run goes on .
&quot; that tu@@ g for example for a bottle of water is calling for a bottle of water for a bottle of water is not rar@@ ity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
and the women are alone ; they are not protected by their families .
&quot; who believe that the end , as soon as they arrived in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; even here , women in re@@ fuge@@ e countries would often be considered as min@@ der@@ ous and worst . &quot;
&quot; this means that about 90 percent of women , who are staying in the accommodation in the Munich &apos;s north , mour@@ ning , appreci@@ ates them . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot;
many women are so used to say they had nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t tr@@ un@@ ks , open to the adventures because the shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; since they often do not cure themselves , it needed more accommodations just for them , calls for B@@ ahr . &quot;
in Bavaria the seven Bezir@@ ks are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
&quot; on the question , whether they wake up from a similar project like in Munich in its competence area , answer some with no . &quot;
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken about there is something in the accommodations of governments not .
&quot; also in Schw@@ aben , women are not divided alone , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , Pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ cher of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Unter@@ wasser and Medi@@ fran@@ ken there are in some commun@@ ion accommodations or own homes only for all @-@ standing women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception to Dutch , there are two central accommodation exclusively for women . &quot;
the committee &quot; rights of women and gender equality &quot; in the European Parliament calls for that women are to be accommod@@ ated by men .
&quot; in a study that was published for the committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are separate . &quot;
l@@ acks the privacy or become men and women together , it can come to - continual violence against women . &quot;
&quot; especially the laundry room should be easily accessible and accessible for women , stands in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much the women feel that this guardi@@ an can be felt , you can read it on the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since it has been talking about that there is , we have a long queu@@ es , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
one could easily make a second house .
assist@@ ants : demands for new working measures
&quot; assistant of the assistant will have called their union , new working measures relating to their disp@@ ute regarding a new contract . &quot;
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) has demand@@ ed its entire council at the beginning of September more labor measures .
the J@@ DC said that there were Minist@@ ers administ@@ ered to the concerns relating to the contract .
assistance and medical prac@@ tition@@ ers have been adapted in July about the rej@@ ection of a contract that was agreed with the B@@ MA .
it was rej@@ ected by 58 % of his members who have been adjusted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members who was published on Thursday night on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government was de@@ duc@@ tible calm &quot; , &quot; which was rej@@ ected that the contract was rej@@ ected . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; given the J@@ DC Executive Board , the proposed new contract shall be fully re@@ ject and official new negotiations for all acids . &quot;
&quot; as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board has put a formal application for a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council to participate in the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; disp@@ ute disp@@ ute that assistant will fight this year Six@@ sm@@ al , the first overall acci@@ dents in the history of NH@@ S . &quot;
&quot; the head of the B@@ MA assist@@ ants Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana occurred after the election of rej@@ ection of the agreed terms of contract , which were recommended by the B@@ MA . &quot;
&quot; he shared B@@ MA members during meetings , which were still accepted before v@@ oting through 54@@ .000 assist@@ ants and media pres@@ id@@ ents , with that the contract should be beneficial and accepted . &quot;
&quot; according to the vote the Health Minister of Jer@@ emy H@@ unt , that the contract for doctors would be forced in the UK for doctors in England . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce the hands and pro@@ claim an official end of eight months to pro@@ claim the words of the words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin wants his Turkish counter@@ player in the g@@ ild@@ ed hall of St. Pet@@ ers@@ burger Pal@@ ast@@ es , I can not dev@@ our the intru@@ sion that Ankara that wants to most om@@ recon@@ ciliation . &quot;
there were the hand@@ sh@@ ake ; yes .
&quot; but Putin &apos;s smile was dirty and he radi@@ ated barely warmth , even for his back@@ lasting relations . &quot;
Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Er@@ dog@@ an went to his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report whole five times .
I could no longer count .
&quot; he also spoke that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but even better to improve . &quot;
the next day there was a newspaper that Er@@ dog@@ an would have been taken as if would never be something un@@ bl@@ ended .
I seemed to be interpre@@ ted more on the opposite .
&quot; but one of Putin ex@@ radi@@ ant , sustainable radi@@ le showed that the state of Russia had nothing forgotten . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first of what he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory : the ab@@ olition of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Mos@@ k@@ ah &apos;s reaction to the time was angry .
&quot; Putin came from and acc@@ used Ankara , Russia in the back to be fallen . &quot;
the trial was even greater , since it was committed by a ro@@ uted friend . &quot;
the v@@ etr@@ is re@@ build back is difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia have changed since November .
&quot; for months long the state @-@ controlled media have a he@@ fty , unlimited attack on Ankara . &quot;
at once it seemed to be the Tur@@ ks for all the bl@@ ame .
&quot; the most serious officials were the alleg@@ ations of conduc@@ tive officials , that Er@@ dog@@ an &apos;s own family would have benef@@ ited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria , who have been controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he has disp@@ uted this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
&quot; but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message , that there was time to look forward . &quot;
&quot; after all , this meeting took place only because Putin was received from the President Er@@ dog@@ an the sorry that he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia was able to win a kind of victory .
for Ankara the benefits of a c@@ eas@@ e@@ fire are clear on the hand .
&quot; Er@@ dog@@ an needs first and all friends who he can get , after spending last month in a failed co@@ up of almost his ministry . &quot;
repeat terror@@ ist attacks on Turkey also have sh@@ aken it .
but there are also economic moti@@ ves .
&quot; Russian sanctions have met Turkey - especially the ban of char@@ ters , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year . &quot;
the number is reduced by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia will be reli@@ eved in Russia , and char@@ ters will be reli@@ eved when the flights will be back . &quot;
you are counting on a late tower of the Mediterranean Sea .
this week pro@@ gn@@ os@@ ti@@ led the nation@@ ales cheap fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish Agr@@ ari@@ mp@@ orte are back .
&quot; a report in V@@ ed@@ em@@ ost@@ i form@@ ulated it : &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry to the West as it was a response to the tried to attempt to be used as weak answer .
&quot; in addition , the persi@@ stent Gro@@ ll on the Schn@@ eck@@ ent@@ emp@@ o the EU @-@ accession negotiations and Putin - who is arous@@ ed out of the cool mood and decrease the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot;
the Russian state of State gained in Ankara with security a bonus that he has asked for the tried to promote state @-@ rich support for the chosen community organs .
&quot; this is a self @-@ evident for Moscow , which itself has a deep fear of reg@@ ression . &quot;
&quot; the summit meeting in this gl@@ oss Palace at the sea possible to allow Russia and Turkey , one as it described me a analy@@ st once described , &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders , and poor@@ ly dealt with and bad@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; however , despite the public recon@@ ciliation , exist between the two still great differences . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as a peace @-@ fans , but where Russia and Turkey has been able to support Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it could be indic@@ ative that after nearly three hours at the first prize , both President at the press conference said that they had not even striped striped . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey re@@ mi@@ ed it clearly on a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emph@@ asi@@ ze these . &quot;
there is no clear con@@ sen@@ sus on how a common den@@ omin@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open enemies , and considering the pot@@ entials , as the NATO @-@ member of Turkey the Russian Kamp@@ fj@@ et , it is certainly better that the two state leaders at least once again talk . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland is no longer available
the R@@ BS brand should be reduced to a back@@ office part according to the board of the Bank of the Bank .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will not be available to customers outside of Scotland .
R@@ oss Mc@@ E@@ wan distributed the BBC Scotland with that the brand R@@ BS were linked to the global ambi@@ tions of the Bank .
the bank has since then distance since it had to be almost c@@ oll@@ ated and saved .
&quot; in this time brand @-@ strategies &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; used to protect other retail markets . &quot;
&quot; she supported international sport with millions of po@@ unds to sponsor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Rugby to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot;
but now it has decided to get more national brands in the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , head@@ quar@@ tered headquarters and market not@@ ching to Nat@@ West will change . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other , smaller brands for homes , which will receive more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ mm@@ ond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a guided tour of customers and employees in Inver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
&quot; he divided the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B is dedicated to our invest@@ or brand as well as to the brand , under which our employees are employed , since we will now become more of a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; as the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; now , I say that we do not have a global aims but local goals . &quot;
each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities and our employees are working with the customer under these brands .
R@@ BS has already said that its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship will no longer be continued and that it will increase the per@@ cep@@ tibility of different brands in its sport sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it is time for us to develop into the bank of the brands , as we focus on the inner ( we are asked ) to make this to a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the board &apos;s hall . &quot;
&quot; it would have been very z@@ yn@@ ically , if we had said that we would have been a great bank for our customers and would have these brands lan@@ ci@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , think I will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these stamps again , so I think that the time has come . &quot;

Frank@@ ie is one of the best Jo@@ ckey &apos;s best modern and it is no surprise that he has reached this mil@@ estone that have achieved only a few before him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is its tac@@ tical int@@ ell@@ ect that distingu@@ ishes him from the others in the weight control . &quot;
he is a fantastic Ambassador to the race , his enthusiasm and char@@ isma enthusiastic fans already for this sport for years . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie before a couple of weeks ago at Ep@@ s@@ om that he had already fet@@ ched 6@@ ,000 wins if he would not just be a Week@@ end and Groß@@ er jo@@ ckey ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has been conducted in UK almost 30 years ago that is great .

from Russia Putin feu@@ d Stab@@ ili@@ ef Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
the Russian president Vladimir Putin has received its Stab@@ ili@@ ef Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was many years of part of the eng@@ th@@ est trust of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed as a special @-@ commissioned for Environmental and Transport@@ ing matters .
&quot; in an opinion of the Kre@@ ml , it is that Putin without giving reasons the release of Ivan@@ ov@@ s were arranged by his duties as chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Council . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o who was appointed for 2012 Ivan@@ ov@@ s since 2012 was appointed his successor .
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 1972 in the est@@ onian capital Tallinn , he made his degree at the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( MG@@ IM@@ O ) and worked in Tokyo . &quot;
on the website of the Kre@@ ml there is ( in Russian ) that he later was the head manager and the heads of the heads of government .
&quot; about his appointment he said to Putin , &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot;
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as a state of State and insp@@ ections to implement your instructions .
&quot; Putin shared the Russian TV transm@@ itter on Friday with that Ivan@@ ov was therefore asked to leave his post , and V@@ ain@@ o as his successor . &quot;
convince the ri@@ dic@@ ulous faces ?
this step has done Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the eng@@ th@@ est trust Vladimir Putin and works like he for the Soviet intelligence , the K@@ GB . &quot;
as Stab@@ sch@@ ef he was one of the most powerful men of the country .
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on TV , claimed both males that the Stab@@ sch@@ ef appears at his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the smil@@ es for the cameras , here are only a few of them - especially before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so this is the result of a kind of Mak@@ tk@@ fight ?
the white currently no one .
&quot; but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who was once adapted as potential President , who wants to lead the Russian environmental policy - came to great sc@@ ep@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in his remarks on Putin , who were quoted on the website of the credit , Ivan@@ ov &quot; &quot; it is true that I could have asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation , I could almost say this very complicated post - you could almost say - compla@@ in of four years to trust . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential system for four years . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov participated in the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Minister and Def@@ ence Policy .

Que@@ ens@@ ferry Crossing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion project should be completed by May 2017 . &quot;
Engineers have connected the North @-@ deck of Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings with the via@@ duc@@ t - what means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
it is the first of four clos@@ es of the &quot; ceil@@ ings &quot; that approach each of the three towers of the bridge .
the brid@@ ging section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weigh@@ s 30@@ .000 tons .
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20.000 tons of concrete and 46 guns . &quot;
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion project should be completed by May 2017 . &quot;
economic Minister Kei@@ th Brown takes place a visit today and was one of the first that went down from the country to the bridge .
he said : &quot; this is an historic and symbo@@ lic moment at the construction of Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings .
&quot; we are all witnesses of an engine@@ ers from a truly ep@@ ic extent in this project with over 30@@ ,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the lock between the via@@ duc@@ t and the bridge deck is a hei@@ co@@ le activity , which require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit . &quot;
&quot; altogether , nearly 79 % of the entire br@@ ush@@ ers are at their place and the last section of the Dec@@ ks today gets a bet@@ ong@@ uss for the deck , which means that the entire Deck is ready to be put on the bridge to its place . &quot;
Michael Martin the project manager of F@@ orth Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure is a considerable mil@@ estone in every brid@@ ging project .
in this fantastic project the exp@@ ul@@ sion of trend@@ setting and super@@ structure .
&quot; after the installation of the last street snow covered , and its connection with the expansion of the North @-@ deck , we had to finish the still existing gap in the north or land@@ side . &quot;
this was reached by drag@@ ging the northern hemisph@@ ere bridge of 700 milli@@ metres .
this was a massive and at the same time very hot activity .
&quot; solid , since the via@@ duc@@ t 222 Meter is long , about 6@@ ,000 tons weigh@@ s and had to be drawn up at a slope of about 3 % . &quot;
&quot; even as the toler@@ ances , since the team works , tiny were - on each side they bet@@ s only some milli@@ metres . &quot;
fortunately everything went very well .
res@@ cue in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have good luck to be alive &quot;
&quot; three men have &quot; happiness to be alive &quot; after they were thro@@ wn by their fishing boat before Angl@@ es@@ ey .

&quot; we saw the boat in its proximity to turned , and put us the worst before , &quot; said the head of the lif@@ ebo@@ at station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds called the boat already out of their range , until we left water , he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were saved from a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhau@@ sted at the age of 60 exhau@@ sted , and on a bo@@ je hang@@ ing without life@@ jacket . &quot;
they all came on board the coast@@ line boots and were brought back to the lif@@ ebo@@ at station
&quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; the three men were thro@@ wn into the water , have luck un@@ hurt and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boot @-@ motor show more than a notation , but this does not solve the boat from the person on the boat from the person by the boat . &quot;
someone today spoke about these men today .

this endor@@ sed her sister .
&quot; together with their life @-@ threat@@ ening , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to so@@ othing their brother . &quot;
&quot; however , it could not move him to leave the apartment . &quot;
therefore she went with her life @-@ threat@@ ening out of the house .

who is expanding Braun@@ schwei@@ gs cheap apartments ?
the SPD and Green : investors should be much stronger in the future for future .
how does one react to the bad news that Braunschweig has to lose almost 1300 apartments in the next few years ?
the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; palm tree &quot; . &quot; &quot;
but argument is program@@ med .
in first line it is about the question : who should actually build the cheap apartments actually ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; SPD @-@ president Christoph Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; we are able to build up with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas in the future 20 per cent of all apartments as a social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the cheap apartments can also be developed in the stock . &quot;
&quot; however , the great strike at the city hall is however , as Brat@@ mann , &quot; How do you want to build investors , who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want to build investors on such areas at least 10 per cent , but as 20 per cent of the apartments as a social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new urban housing programme , which will cost millions and will be financed and will provide incen@@ tives for incen@@ tives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is still no agreement between groups . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as a few rules as possible .
the left is still hardness for investors .
&quot; regardless of how Brat@@ mann , ground@@ ing is a shar@@ pen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; the concept concept is implemented , it will provide for additional tasks in the building administration . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the experts .
&quot; yet , the program is not entirely different : for the approximately 1260 new apartments , which should be built . &quot;
but how does it gli@@ ding the loss of more about 1300 cheap apartments which encour@@ aged in the coming years ?
&quot; only up to the year 2020 , there will be 500 apartments alone . &quot;
&quot; to prevent this , so the plan@@ etary speaker in Nicole Palm , should now be ordered from the city now . &quot;
&quot; moreover , it would have to be thought to get back into the price list again . &quot;
this is possible in the west city .
click on a blow to solve the problem .
because in the west city run to the end of the final time .
around 1800 apartments there could be booked to the pri@@ cing for cheap apartments .
&quot; only : we want the owners , the housing companies do not want . &quot;
&quot; for the number of social apartments in the western city will increase dram@@ atically , one can be removed from the goal of so called . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a concentration of social weak@@ nesses in just a few distric@@ ts will no longer be allowed to give it . &quot;
the Gre@@ ens are meant that there is still movement in the discussion .
&quot; president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; for a wide majority of the CD@@ U must be the CD@@ U into the boat . &quot;
that is focused on more buildings for families .
but what does not mean that not yet a compromise can be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness , which is worth it
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
&quot; that teen@@ ager and child to play no longer go outside , but rather it prefer to spend their leisure time to rigi@@ d on scre@@ ens , was over the last decade of many be@@ ech@@ es . &quot;
&quot; at Pok@@ emon Go , it is about getting people from the sofa and be more active . &quot;
&quot; the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and last on smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and activities are not exclu@@ de mutual . &quot;
&quot; I certainly consider myself at the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , a app that have been created on the characters , initially created for the video games in the 1990@@ s ( later it came from a cartoon , game cards and other spin off@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; how many phen@@ omena of pop@@ ularity s@@ ank the interest in front of the game published in the U.S. , Australia and New Zealand in early July . &quot;
the launch in other countries was moved by the massive demand that the server over@@ loaded .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than T@@ inder and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , the players go out with their smartphones , and looking for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons , who have been pursu@@ ed with a GPS as soon as they were found once , &quot; photograp@@ hed &quot; ( via a screenshot on the phone ) or &quot; cap@@ tured &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; one generation that played the game when she was still younger , closed down the W@@ ahn , and jump@@ ed for the search of the sofa . &quot;
in the US the game led to a considerable increase of steps that determine the &quot; average &quot; person every day .
&quot; cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , followed the 35@@ ,000 users followed by Washington Post recently , that within two days following the launch of the game , the number of trac@@ eable people who have increased every day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who knows Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it just sees the raw data for the performance .
&quot; many public up@@ set up to health , people want to bring to be &quot; &quot; 30 minutes to take away , &quot; &quot; from the sofa to come &quot; and &quot; every day to be active , because many public messages are boring and come from people to look . &quot;
&quot; however , the meaning of sport can not be over@@ rated . &quot;
&quot; who regularly drives sports , reduces its chances , in cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps with weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here . &quot;
&quot; but the wonderful at Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open , that makes them fun . &quot;
&quot; thus , three pillars of health covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun . &quot;
some people close to hunting even new friend@@ ships .
as always there is also m@@ ür@@ ric playing pro@@ ves that always have to compla@@ in about something .
and yes , someone might go against a door . &quot;
what should &apos; s ?
it has a break@@ through .
&quot; even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit earlier could follow our activity , they gave us no reason to boost sports such as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its charm and the use shall be re@@ tained with the time .
&quot; but due to Pok@@ em@@ ons success there will be more games , the apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ations will be given in the real world and to help many people on hunting , active , f@@ itter and health@@ ier . &quot;

police : 3 victims in the mass mort@@ als at the music shot in the car
&quot; according to police report , which were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl were shot in one of the dead@@ liest attacks for a decade in the first mass of Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and listen@@ ed to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot at the 12th of June , while the car was posted in a driv@@ eway , said the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the per@@ pet@@ ual eight shots from a hand@@ over weapon , while he stood on the passenger &apos;s side of the car , and fle@@ w afterwards with another vehicle , is in the report to read . &quot;
&quot; the police partly coll@@ ectively , that the triple murder did not seem to be the result of a rob@@ ber , as the att@@ acker may not have the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , who found themselves in possession of an adult victims . &quot;
&quot; the poli@@ ti@@ cian of Phoenix S@@ gt@@ . Jonathan Howard said that the sk@@ ew@@ ing is expl@@ ored , a close look at whether they are linked with four previous attacks . &quot;
&quot; total , mainly in his@@ pan@@ al residential buildings were killed within four months in nine att@@ acked seven people and two others in@@ ju@@ red . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; shared Howard of the K@@ HP@@ O , a subsidiary of CB@@ S , beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is thought that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles including a brown Nis@@ s@@ ans from the late 1990@@ s , a black BMW from the late 1990@@ s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln . &quot;
&quot; investig@@ ators refer@@ ring to the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked , and committed by the same mur@@ der@@ ers . &quot;
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to its viol@@ ations and died later . &quot;
&quot; Liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah , still on site . &quot;
a witness of the police with that it was not unusual to sit in a p@@ aired car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities published also a police report on the shooting , which was taken on an empty Pick@@ up truck a half hour before the three @-@ fold murder and from which it had gone out that it was the work of the mass . &quot;
&quot; investig@@ ators found cartridges , and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball @-@ frag@@ ments from the motor . &quot;
&quot; mother of a 6 @-@ year with micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; &quot; it gets better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ uto lo@@ ves the S@@ ingen , and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but as the least of his aging , Ed@@ mund micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a gen@@ etic dist@@ urb@@ ance , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ ble during their pregnancy nothing knew . &quot;
&quot; when he came home my first time I was my first thought , I managed not . &quot;
I managed not .
I did not agree .
&quot; what is not right at all -- &quot; &quot; of course you have taken care of it , &quot; &quot; said her . &quot;
&quot; by Vincent and her husband , Vincent and her was told that Ed@@ mund they can never recognize them under circumstances and that he may not even survive at any time . &quot;
some doctors even went so far that they vor@@ ced to institutional him .
&quot; my first answer to it &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; stated Pic@@ ci@@ uto . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of a re@@ medy .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit down to his third life of life and he is still not able to speak .
but he slowly turns progress .
he can run with support and cycling .
he likes to play with his two brothers and singing .
Elizabeth shows the drawing by Ed@@ mund for &quot; Please sing a little bit before . &quot;
&quot; we bring him string . &quot; &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ uto CB@@ S News . &quot;
but there is no typical mis@@ language -- says it . Ed@@ mund has inv@@ ented some characters alone .
&quot; micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : gen@@ etic such as for Ed@@ mund , as well as infections with viruses such as mas@@ ers or Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy . &quot;
the symptoms and forec@@ asts may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will influence the life of the cement .
Pic@@ ci@@ uto is rem@@ ind@@ ed of the emotional price of an un@@ issen future .
I always asked what will happen ?
what will be done ?
and she still know not really .
I &apos;ve been asked for a long time after the pro@@ gn@@ osis because I am not exp@@ ecting to tell me someone really .
but Pic@@ ci@@ uto has caused a hop@@ e@@ ful advice for m@@ others of inf@@ ants with anten@@ na@@ ce caused by the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus .
it gets better .
you know that it will become better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .

&quot; numerous rivers in the southeast Lou@@ is@@ ian@@ as and the south of the Mississi@@ pp@@ is flo@@ ods its shore and dro@@ pped with large @-@ scale flo@@ ods in extreme ra@@ ven@@ es , reported the national weather service . &quot;
the govern@@ or of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Ed@@ wards in continuous contact with local authorities and help to the affected municip@@ alities are already on the road .
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spok@@ es@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of Govern@@ or , distributed with that the requests for high@@ water cars , boats and sand@@ wich@@ es . &quot;
&quot; Ste@@ ele said that alone the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a thousand sand@@ wich@@ es would have been ordered . &quot;
a flo@@ at@@ able system will be used more than wide parts in the south Lou@@ is@@ ian@@ as to Saturday .
the we@@ alth@@ y service provided that in this area may fall additional 3 to 5 inches of rain .
&quot; in the south of Al@@ ab@@ amas , on Friday was a flag@@ ration system , while in the field of mobile . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , which can both be found in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , all pro@@ bability , after the weekend of record . &quot;
the met@@ ere@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could survive many houses in the suburbs near Bat@@ on Rouge .
&quot; he also said that a current over@@ ri@@ dden flo@@ ods in A@@ scen@@ sion Par@@ ish is a danger , as these things will flow through the ge@@ ars rivers only slowly into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the Scor@@ fa@@ w , south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , arrived on Friday around 09.00 to the highest state that has ever recorded . &quot;
&quot; Rett@@ di@@ ste@@ ams , still people from the flo@@ od@@ ine in the district Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the south @-@ west of Mississippi . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were found among those who were saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water of Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet from his house at night . &quot;
&quot; he said that him is another step@@ son who lives nearby , war@@ ned . &quot;
&quot; we are awak@@ ened and the water flows and curr@@ ents her@@ ein , &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
his wife said Hans@@ ford that they lived there in the 48 years where they had never seen such a high level of the river .
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have had all the disabilities and he would have been the one , the swimming pool would be able to swim . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that Not@@ hel@@ pers had saved all three in a great military truck , and they had brought them into the next fire@@ house where they were hous@@ ed until Friday . &quot;
&quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the flo@@ od @-@ breathing &quot; had quickly changed , since it continues to fall heavy ra@@ ins and that the authorities is ev@@ acu@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , a ob@@ server close to Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13,@@ 75 inch rain . &quot;
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the ground was substantially fully accompl@@ ished through the rain@@ y waste since Wednesday .
&quot; the authorities gave to that heavy ra@@ ins and road @-@ flo@@ ods the res@@ cue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a Par@@ ish and lessons in five class@@ rooms . &quot;
the CB@@ S subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a sub@@ ordin@@ ate in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a 200 flo@@ od@@ ed houses ang@@ ab .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches which are now both flo@@ od@@ ed .
the ru@@ ler of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities were 72 people and seven pets who were saved by the flo@@ od@@ ing water .

&quot; in the town of Ham@@ mond the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a were made almost two frag@@ rant streets due to the high water , and sand@@ wich@@ es for the residents to co @-@ measure , which hope to keep the water from their houses and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last great flo@@ ods that we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city hall . &quot;
this seems to be a similar inci@@ dent .
&quot; in Mississi@@ pp , the emer@@ gency manager of Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of the Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys , that it continues to be on the Gulf coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his information , a hand@@ ful homes have been reported on Thursday as flo@@ od@@ ed , but on Friday were not reported until now . &quot;
&quot; Kei@@ th Town@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I saw water in places where I have never seen before , &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; by balls &quot; , &quot; survi@@ ved mon@@ itors in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police shares that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already won the second time that a 6 @-@ year child has been p@@ oured . &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boys identi@@ fied him for CB@@ S Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; the grand@@ parents gave him that Brown had several vulner@@ abilities , including in the l@@ ende , leg , arm and belly , but that he was with his transport to the hospital in consciousness . &quot;
&quot; he has gone a lot , his small body was through spher@@ es , divided his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transm@@ itter . &quot;
I cannot do that simply .
the state of the boys was increased in a hospital as a cri@@ tic and he had to move several operations .
the family of the boy was shared with the transm@@ itter that he is expected to be expected .
he would have to start the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
&quot; likewise , three men were shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year old . &quot;
one of the 29 @-@ year men is in critical state ; the other two victims are in stable state according to the CB@@ S Philadelphia in stable condition .
&quot; the boy was found on the front of a car along with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , which is found in a critical state , reports on the sender . &quot;
&quot; the other two victims were not found in the car and the police were determined precisely , whether under one of the most recent men of the per@@ petrators are . &quot;
investig@@ ators of the CB@@ S Philadelphia with that it seems to be a cru@@ ci@@ ous between several guns .
&quot; pat@@ ron@@ age for over@@ m@@ gew@@ ood , which were trac@@ ed to various over@@ ri@@ ors , se@@ ated the crime . &quot;
it seems that it is clearly negoti@@ ated for a lasting struggle .
&quot; on the street , on both sides of the go , they found himself . &quot;
&quot; it seems to have given a number of armed fight@@ ers who were very active here , &quot; the Poli@@ zei@@ tiger Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di the police in Philadelphia with the sender . &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles hit in the area .
&quot; there came to no ar@@ rests , and the police are currently chec@@ king reports to the over@@ thro@@ wing video . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year girl met by an finger loop on the arm , when she played in front of the West Oak Lane in front of her house . &quot;
it is happy and the police are still looking for a sus@@ pic@@ ion .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Laur@@ ie &quot;
this is what I present to me at the Frauen@@ olymp@@ i@@ am@@ ann@@ in in the turn and that is out of more than one reason .
&quot; first , I have been in the first time since 1984 and the US have never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; and second@@ ly , this team has three run@@ ners , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Laur@@ en &quot; Laur@@ ie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , which inspir@@ es for many young girls from other skin colour . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man , the J@@ ü@@ din is and Madi@@ son Ko@@ cian , which is Catholic , makes every pride . &quot;
this team finally reflects the US .
it has paved the black and his@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one was one under the female tur@@ ner@@ ve an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americ@@ as .
last year were Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
in the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympi@@ ag@@ ew@@ ridge and America ju@@ bel@@ te .
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple World Championship in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Laur@@ ie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as she was un@@ expected , but master@@ ful Gy@@ mas@@ tic@@ rout@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone the fourth , heter@@ os@@ exual minist@@ ers who won during an individual multi @-@ channel event for women . &quot;
Li@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man won silver .
&quot; we are experiencing the tip of this sport , but they do not see train@@ ings in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Laur@@ ie sm@@ ote all the same way as A@@ ly and Madi@@ son , to create it into the olymp@@ ic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympi@@ am@@ ann@@ is will have only four tur@@ ner@@ ves inside the team . also , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality is seen from that turn is a expensive sport and turn @-@ in first line in private ma@@ ver@@ t which will maintain the training , setup , travel and hotel rooms ( for the train@@ ers and their turn and families ) . the list can be desired . &quot;
the majority of these train@@ ers are in well @-@ emin@@ ent suburbs to support the business .
in these verses the turn will receive your collected training and this is a expensive and long @-@ term engagement .
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer by Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , Train@@ ers by Laur@@ ie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both have started their ath@@ letes , since they started with the tur@@ ns . &quot;
&quot; we have to be inspired the churches , young girls who inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Laur@@ ie , a powerful and more easily accessible . &quot;
I have established my gymn@@ asium of 20 years .
&quot; in my event we have compli@@ mentary and affordable tur@@ bul@@ es in Harlem for more than 15@@ ,000 urban young people ( especially black and his@@ pan@@ ian ) and trained national and international winner . &quot;
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) expand to learn the youth high quality Tur@@ ns that will deser@@ ve the opportunity to learn from this great winter sports .
&quot; tur@@ nen develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determin@@ at@@ eness for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ life benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
&quot; it is the inspiration of this team , the thousands of young girls take care of interest to the tur@@ bul@@ ence and this is great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such exciting time .
&quot; thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Laur@@ ie , Gab@@ by and Madi@@ son for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en of the winter cre@@ schafts@@ gol@@ ds and thank you , F@@ ate her so many young girls with different background motiv@@ ates to start their way to maintain healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assist@@ ants would like to organ@@ ise other stri@@ kes after they have rej@@ ected Jer@@ emy I@@ ts proposal
&quot; the Minist@@ ers had revealed the disp@@ ute over the changes to adop@@ ting a reform@@ ist agreement with the functioning of the British Medical Association , but 58 per cent of the 37@@ ,000 assist@@ ants who agreed upon an election . &quot;
in July H@@ unt plans will be revealed to introduce the contract and said that the NH@@ S would be in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and any other delay for employees and patients were harmful .
the first assist@@ ants will receive a new contract to change the changes to night@@ - and week@@ ends to improve care of un@@ lock@@ able watch@@ times .
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the B@@ MA Committee for assist@@ ants shared last night in a communication with : &quot; assist@@ ants have given the proposed contract for such a serious concerns , especially that it will meet the current employees crisis and it administ@@ ered to treat all doctors . &quot;
&quot; at just eight weeks , which still remains , until the first group of doctors under the new contract shall be made progress and the time runs out . &quot;
efforts by the B@@ MA for sol@@ ving the disp@@ utes by talks to the government on contradictions and sometimes on o@@ conduc@@ ting silence .
&quot; it happened that of a speaking , Jer@@ emy H@@ unt had made the last month about the last month , that his door would always be off@@ ended . &quot;
Jer@@ emy H@@ unt has to act now to raise the record and concerns of assist@@ ants .
&quot; if he did not do this , so we have made the wiz@@ ards clearly that they are ready to perform further workers . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a record of nearly 13@@ ,000 rout@@ ine@@ ations and 100@@ .000 dates , as nur@@ ses and specialists in order to give doctors on the strike @-@ post@@ ers . &quot;
the Minist@@ ers had revealed the disp@@ ute over the changes to adop@@ ting the reform@@ ist agreement with the functioning of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the B@@ MA wishes to get a better wo@@ und@@ ing warning for the 54@@ .000 assist@@ ants , which are subject to the contract . &quot;
Daniel Mor@@ timer , General @-@ Director of the NH@@ S staff , called for assist@@ ants to end the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; workers &quot; work achieve nothing of the only little , but already loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patients , nur@@ sing and their families only wor@@ ries , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; in the last two months we spoke to the Committee of assist@@ ants and with the health Ministry , and other minist@@ ries have a positive impact on concerns regarding the guardi@@ an and the whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; employers hop@@ ed that the sustain@@ ed positive commitment to other important topics - such as disp@@ atch , flexibility when training courses , training courses , mutual recognition of teaching , training courses and the gender education for compliance with the B@@ MA in November , February and May were . &quot;
the £ 2 @-@ per Tag@@ - medicine can decrease the heart attack
&quot; thousands of heart patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medicine , after the authorities was recommended to adop@@ t this more people for a longer period of time . &quot;
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or medication reduces the risk of repeti@@ tive heart inf@@ ar@@ se for people with a cardi@@ ovascular disease .
&quot; the medication is reduced to a heart attack for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack . &quot;
the regulatory authorities nice of the NH@@ S has recommended for four years to reduce the risk of cardi@@ ovascular problems .
the regulatory authorities nice of the NH@@ S has recommended for four years to reduce the risk of cardi@@ ovascular problems .
around 140@@ .000 people suffer a heart attack and a quarter of which suffer from another heart attack or stroke .
&quot; heart attack and stroke are caused by accum@@ ulation fatty material in the arter@@ ies , which form imp@@ aired . &quot;
&quot; if the ins@@ ag it breaks , there can cause blood flow to the heart , and caused by blood flow to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; if the blood @-@ key is sol@@ ving , it can flow through the blood stream and hide the blood flow to the brain , which causes a stroke . &quot;
individuals who had already had a heart attack , are subject to a higher risk to further . &quot;
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or which is manufactured by the British company A@@ stra@@ da and is distributed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que is reduced by reducing the risk that makes the formation of blood cl@@ ots un@@ prob@@ able .
&quot; the trial &apos;s throw from nice who has been published today , recomm@@ ends an 12 @-@ mon@@ ati@@ ge intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of asp@@ ir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , director of the nice health adv@@ ancing centre said : &quot; &quot; despite the availability of sec@@ ondary perspective , a quarter of all persons who suffered a heart attack , another heart attack , or a stroke - often with desp@@ air consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with asp@@ ir@@ in effectively at the reduction of other cardi@@ ac disease and stroke in people who have already had a heart attack .
&quot; due to a pro@@ visional recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand the available therapies to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;
the information about the effectiveness and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the blood of blood pressure - is limited to a period of up to three years . the in@@ augur@@ ation design recomm@@ ends no treatment that goes beyond this period .
culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness makes v@@ oting in Muslim areas .
former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ for Rah@@ man was last year on the release of a government report because of corruption from the office
&quot; a culture of the Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to that far @-@ common vote was ignor@@ ed in Muslim communities , such as a non @-@ anni@@ hil@@ ation report today . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es , Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es attacks the police , elect@@ oral and Rath@@ aus@@ es to have ignor@@ ed evidence of v@@ aul@@ ts due to &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ nia and religion . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former minister of integration and commun@@ al government , which is now a stake of vot@@ ers from religious moti@@ ves so bad , that it should be the police should be allowed to set up bu@@ b@@ ills outside of elect@@ or@@ ated elect@@ or@@ ers . &quot;
he recomm@@ ends that vot@@ ers should lead a reference to themselves in order to prove their identity .
&quot; currently , a vot@@ ers must be called his name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report suggests , not removable ink on the finger of a person raised , if they give up their v@@ oting to prevent that someone is chosen . &quot;
&quot; whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ers should get more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he calls that the press should have more access to municip@@ alities and decisions of un@@ official committ@@ ees or working groups .
&quot; this does not only serve against v@@ ector , but is also the municip@@ al government in front of the bro@@ ader inter@@ rup@@ tions and financial governance , that goes with it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by the Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets Wahl@@ sk@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
last year decided to be a special dish that the acting Mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man to become a L@@ itan@@ ei to cor@@ rupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
&quot; the court there was that Rachel would have per@@ pet@@ ed the religious feelings of his mus@@ lim@@ ous community &quot; in z@@ yn@@ ic way , and that he would have per@@ pet@@ ed his cri@@ tics with rac@@ ists and Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bi@@ bi@@ anism . &quot;
&quot; Rachel is to have attri@@ buted his campaign on the basis , that it may be the rel@@ ig@@ ned duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
&quot; up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of a rep@@ lica , when a person is chosen as someone else . &quot;
Sir Eric said that it would be the whole country of evidence of frau@@ d .
&quot; he expressed himself in particular alar@@ ming for frau@@ dul@@ ent letters - in the older members of the Muslim community pressure on people , had to choose a candidate for their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , illustr@@ ated , made several recommendations to cut the elect@@ oral system , including the fox@@ es , to prove the identity . &quot;
&quot; in his report it says : &quot; &quot; as evidence was attached that pressure on prot@@ ective minorities has been exercis@@ ed , especially women and young people to choose according to the will of the elders , especially communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ic or ban@@ th@@ ic background . &quot;
there were concerns that ... state institutions have such behavior such as behaviour due to &quot; politically correc@@ tive &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to the eth@@ nia and religion should be ignor@@ ed .
Sir Eric talked to 50 recommendations to cut the system including the ban that political ac@@ tivi@@ sts must be signed in order to stop &quot; campaigns . &quot;
&quot; the report , which is held by Ther@@ esa May in consider@@ ate , requires also tou@@ g@@ her regist@@ rations , to prevent that the legis@@ lat@@ ure is used to imm@@ ig@@ r@@ ament and social welfare purposes . &quot;
options in consideration the vot@@ ers before your choice to ask for your ID .
not removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she delivered her voice to prevent that someone will choose .
systematic rel@@ ess@@ ations about the nation@@ ality of a person to ensure that they are optional .
a three @-@ year @-@ old limit on request to an automatic letter .
ban that political ac@@ tivi@@ sts complete brief@@ ing and envelop@@ es of letters .
&quot; the police are to give the authority , bar@@ rier to v@@ ase @-@ ups . &quot;
a legis@@ lative change which facilit@@ ates an ac@@ cus@@ ation due to in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation according to the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( Volks@@ fest Act 1983 ) .
Fot@@ ograp@@ her in Wahl@@ gy@@ ms .
requirement that only English in the v@@ oting can be used ( with the exception of Wales ) .
&quot; intensi@@ fication of the training , to ensure that the employees are usually en@@ forced that vot@@ ers go alone into the elect@@ or@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; that after Tower Ham@@ lets case has no radi@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; the election has Lut@@ for Rah@@ man and his dep@@ uty for a L@@ itan@@ ei to cor@@ rupt and illegal practices as unt@@ ately explained , &quot; he said . &quot;
it was suffici@@ ently known because of a number of reasons for sub@@ missions - according to the high requirements in the legal procedure - guil@@ ty .
he also cri@@ tic@@ ised the effective &quot; Ab@@ h@@ ak@@ contro@@ vers@@ ations &quot; of the legis@@ lat@@ ations of the Rath@@ aus@@ es .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the Court of Justice in Tower Ham@@ lets of the last year was a warm signal .
&quot; our country is contribut@@ ing to the mother of parli@@ aments , a proud heritage , but the wor@@ rying and wor@@ rying of some authorities threatened with this good reputation . &quot;
crazy after K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ double @-@ based and other famous double @-@ de@@ cess@@ or of Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ als in Rio
fans of the Olympi@@ ad 2016 in Rio are this week over French wheel@@ ers in Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Prev@@ ot except the border and tape who has proved to be an impressive double @-@ one of the duk@@ es of Cambridge .
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year @-@ year Olympi@@ ast@@ kin is by far not the only to defeat gold strug@@ gles , which has its own famous double @-@ de@@ cess@@ or - at least not when you give social media faith . &quot;
&quot; to honour the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces , which are currently created at our screen , FE@@ MA@@ IL have created a lists at Olympi@@ ast@@ les , which has more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Holl@@ y@@ wood@@ famous . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ unter and the Wolf : team member of the US @-@ Team in Archery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio &quot;
&quot; besides i@@ dual double @-@ based on the Rad@@ r@@ enn@@ bahn , many people on the internet point out , like a certain arch@@ ers of the c@@ age of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio could be . &quot;
&quot; the team member of the US @-@ Team in Archery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a rush on Twitter after pictures , on which he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ hei@@ fers . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the arch@@ ery was given the mad@@ ness into the social media and gave to that he has already been hearing from his child@@ hood since he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I do not see great simil@@ arity with the exception of the facial hair , partly bra@@ dy of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a ben@@ ign guy , so I do that as comp@@ liments . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly occur even more in the centre : the rising simil@@ arity between British Weit@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; the Russian Tur@@ ner@@ in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with their big , expres@@ sive eyes is supposed to go through as double @-@ room for the ku@@ b@@ ular American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
and in the swimming pool the South African swimm@@ e Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison .
one course higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the inc@@ eption .
another continued comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett which are similar to severe eyebrows and lips .
&quot; the Russian silver @-@ med@@ alli@@ er Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ fi@@ mo@@ va pro@@ ves to more than just the even an endless skin and blonde hair such as the act@@ ress Ann@@ al@@ yn@@ ne Mc@@ Cor@@ d , while the American Nathan was att@@ acked by fans , a &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
&quot; strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial eyes and eyes &quot;
not the one : a Twitter User was very happy about that others are the simil@@ arities also .
Theory is put into the room : according to this user there is a reason for the simil@@ arity of the Pa@@ ares perhaps one reason .
a Twitter User@@ in explained her satisfaction that the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter almost identical .
in fact the U.S. football star Hope solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter an incredibly similar facial eyes and eyes .
&quot; other popular compar@@ isons ch@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh @-@ Jenn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical with the act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold med@@ alli@@ sts in Tur@@ n Gab@@ by Douglas , who res@@ em@@ bles their own beautiful , wide smile , which res@@ em@@ bles that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;

&quot; the buyer did not know where they should h@@ ate , when a woman out their clothes in the midst of a pri@@ mor@@ on to sample under@@ pants . &quot;
&quot; to per@@ ate the situation , mu@@ ster@@ ed them as they saw it out , and put them back into the shelf . &quot;
they browse further and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping center in Folk@@ estone .

&quot; a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ d@@ son who was at the same time in the shop , said that after the mysterious woman had the under@@ wear , &quot; she turned back and left the business without buy something . &quot;
she said : &quot; people could not believe what they saw .
&quot; in the middle of the out@@ lets standing , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the outlet , moved her own tig@@ hts and pants and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she did not even try to find a little discre@@ te place to do it - she was just there , fre@@ ch as O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; each rigi@@ d , when they re@@ vo@@ ke the under@@ pants that you obviously have not noticed it , because they put them back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; she revi@@ ved the same with three other under@@ pants before they finally decided that you fell down , again and r@@ aus@@ ed . &quot;
she seemed to be dist@@ urb@@ ing that she observed someone observed - or about the person who would buy the under@@ pants that she had tried them .
&quot; Mrs. Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 who lives in K@@ ent said , &quot; &quot; How to think that someone would take home with home who had another person and that were not washed away . &quot;

&quot; Ms. Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; as I got , the staff tries to pull the gar@@ ment pieces from the sale after they went - what is just as good . &quot;

travel@@ er Ian W@@ right sc@@ mp@@ les for a travel guide to the dirty places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ went his immune system and lit@@ ters of a serious test - by making some of the dirty and inf@@ am@@ less places in Europe .
&quot; the Moderator and passport Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k sch@@ ab@@ sent his assignment in a euro area , a rail@@ ing head to Pic@@ c@@ adil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a sink and public telephone in Russia to provide the resistance of its immune system . &quot;
&quot; before rej@@ ecting each object , he used a L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ers to get around and to show us what he will let itself . &quot;
&quot; but the experi@@ ment which was fil@@ med under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; , &quot; brought some surprising results to the day@@ light . &quot;
&quot; the thought that was used the sink of a draw@@ als , which has already been used by thousands of others , but may indeed be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but indeed they are in a kitchen ill@@ nesses of bad bacteria . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with physi@@ cians and medical professionals across the promotion of gut bacteria as well as his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately nothing left , what he decl@@ ines , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right was known to test the w@@ att@@ age of his intest@@ ine by bringing through the world , and pec@@ uli@@ ar as well as wonderful things . &quot;
&quot; from public funds to railway stations , up to sink of toilets , the task put its immune system definitely under a sample &quot;
&quot; in the film he said , &quot; &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned what my health affects and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud water . &quot;
in the film he became his reputation in any case .
&quot; the little thing he used , was a dirty public toilet in Russia . &quot;
its Pro@@ be@@ ab@@ uses showed a L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ric number of over 4000 units .
in comparison to the L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ers are fresh washed hands less than 60 .
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet that he ref@@ used to ref@@ use their L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ers over 4000 units , while fresh@@ ly washed hands of less than 60 consec@@ rated . &quot;
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturers of milk products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number of different places like the bathroom
&quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; this is the worst thing I have got into a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing mud@@ dy than that !
&quot; I &apos;m going to do nothing here , because it is not inside . &quot;
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with Finnish manufacturers of da@@ ir@@ y products Vali@@ dator .
the company took Mr W@@ right with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us who contains both militar@@ isation and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
&quot; Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , sa@@ ints and New categories Nik@@ o Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer the consumers really something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to look and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ biotics .
&quot; we did crazy Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings , that was done with that we said &quot; L@@ ass us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in the intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of only about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with documentary film we were able to provide more information on an interesting way .
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , which led the direction of the film , added : &quot; &quot; let me say so - I would have loved my respect for Ian , which I had directed to him , like the ec@@ el@@ ude Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course there were things when it was easier to bring Ian , they anz@@ ul@@ sta@@ ins and others , where this was quite difficult . &quot;
I am glad that we have recorded some of these dirty sho@@ ots on film .
in one of Vali@@ d the survey conducted in 2015 associ@@ ates 84 percent of all respon@@ dents and intest@@ ine in particular with the well being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said that they are at least occasionally products used to use lac@@ tic lac@@ tic bacteria .
&quot; A@@ social family were destroyed before del@@ ing social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; a as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family left its social apartment after a del@@ ays with a damage in the amount of £ 5@@ 0,000 because they had its neighb@@ ours . &quot;
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ ty were thro@@ wn according to a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash Corn@@ wall .
&quot; after they were viol@@ ently removed from their property , the property found the property in an ir@@ rep@@ aired state . &quot;
&quot; walls referred to , wood sh@@ ri@@ mps have been mounted on the floor , tr@@ ash was sc@@ atter@@ ed on the floor , and gra@@ ffiti was transferred to walls . &quot;
the family were introduced and it is thought that it is now living in a private accommodation .
&quot; Don@@ na Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , who works for the housing administration at Corn@@ wall Housing , said that they fear@@ ed that the apartment is no longer rep@@ aired . &quot;
she said : &quot; it was for people here an absolute night@@ mare and I am the view that people have not to live in this way .
there are many things to consider that this property is probably regarded as not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is advis@@ able and their reputation is also .
&quot; the couple had three sons , who lived in the apartment and the police said that the ter@@ ror , who had added the family , sh@@ y sh@@ y , sh@@ y sh@@ y , drug , and exc@@ es@@ sive swe@@ eping , sh@@ aken and flo@@ ods . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the rental agreement , was commissioned in June an arrangement of anti @-@ social behavior . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which will be dem@@ ol@@ ished under circumstances , old g@@ arb@@ age was found . &quot;
&quot; they were treated in the property , in which the past drugs called drugs called wood sh@@ ri@@ mps . &quot;
&quot; neighb@@ ours said that they saw them on the street , and regularly had to inv@@ oked the police again . &quot;
Corn@@ wall Housing del@@ og@@ ed her and her partner this week non @-@ viol@@ ent of the property after they gave them a pro@@ long@@ ed period of 11 weeks to give up vol@@ un@@ tar@@ ily .
the del@@ ays were conc@@ eived by facilit@@ ated neighb@@ ors who said that their lives was made to hell .
&quot; one said , &quot; &quot; You are committed to anyone . &quot;
we lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; today , tomorrow we could not sleep . &quot;
we got up because it was so quiet - that we are not used .
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice . &quot;
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , neighbourhood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that it had administ@@ ered the family with local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house , to which the police were called at regular inter@@ vals , 20 years . &quot;
on the left @-@ stret@@ ched side of the community @-@ stret@@ ched became tr@@ ash and old toys .
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a dis@@ grace that it administ@@ ered the ten@@ ant , any responsibility for their behavior and the family , as a del@@ ing is always the last step , the Corn@@ wall Housing . &quot;
&quot; it was a very difficult case , as the behavior was extremely difficult and to view their actions for their neighb@@ ours terrible . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ous to us and have made us the information . &quot;
&quot; I hope that this development of some neighb@@ ours is don@@ ated , and the message got that anti@@ social behavior is not toler@@ ated . &quot;
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons lived at different times in the house had lived , but that they were all over 20 . &quot;

&quot; in 2014 the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as gu@@ ards , Parap@@ leg@@ als and cash at the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don received a bankn@@ ote after being guil@@ ty of the owner of a drug class B in trade agreement .
she claimed that the money for a tomb of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who came to life with an accident . &quot;
&quot; after they had no shel@@ ter , that T@@ anya and her partner will now live in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many walls of the house were gra@@ ded with gra@@ ffiti .
police says that she will del@@ ing ten@@ ant who do not keep themselves to the self @-@ order
Angela Cro@@ w by the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall shared with that the del@@ ays had a clear warning to the other ten@@ ant that will not hold to the self @-@ order .
&quot; this goes to those that they can take themselves without self @-@ pro@@ portions , as well as to those who were damaged by such a behaviour , she said . &quot;
the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate cri@@ minal and anti@@ soci@@ etal behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

&quot; this was the moment , in the fri@@ ght@@ ened tourists start to panic , after an Tibetan jet is short@@ ened over a full beach . &quot;
dram@@ atic video recordings showed as the military plane almost in close proximity to the sun@@ light on the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .

&quot; N@@ uno Arro@@ ja added : &quot; I was just at surfing and it felt so on , when the plane would fall down upon me . &quot;
&quot; tourists on the beach of Av@@ eiro were in panic , when the plane came out of the darkness and incredibly deeply fl@@ ed . &quot;
today the Portuguese air@@ struggle have passed today that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft on a workout trip was to identify fishing boats in front of the coast and so deeply fly that this was the only option to recognize them .
&quot; the spok@@ es@@ man said that the jet is due to the poor visibility by itself very much deeper than usual , but per@@ sever@@ ing the air disp@@ ute that safety at no time was at risk . &quot;
&quot; area walls have been destroyed this summer parts of the Portuguese forti@@ fication , in which four people came to death on Madeira Island . &quot;
the Portuguese air@@ struggle today announced that the pilot due to the relationships - strong fo@@ g and bran@@ dy - so deeply flies so what his point of view

Donald Tru@@ mp dre@@ amed ″ huge problems ″ in the election campaign
the leadership of the US @-@ Republi@@ can is driven by massive concerns even in traditionally conserv@@ ative Federal States to include their majority .
Pres@@ idency of the President Donald Tru@@ mp gave now weak@@ nesses of his election campaign in the former republi@@ can highlands in Utah .
&quot; a rare moment , in which the usually large @-@ sp@@ ig and self @-@ confident mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire may be something like concerns , such as correspon@@ dents reported . &quot;
&quot; after he cast 16 ri@@ vals within the own republi@@ can camp out of the race , the dou@@ bts now grow on his success in the fight for the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have huge problems in Utah , &quot; said Tru@@ mp before ev@@ angel@@ ical Christians that he asked for assistance in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; Guilt were false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he took again his well known Medi@@ tations . &quot;
Republi@@ can
Utah is normally a secure bank for the Republi@@ can .
&quot; a survey of Sur@@ vey@@ USA from June , Tru@@ mp and its competitors from the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , equality . &quot;
&quot; other in@@ stitutes see Tru@@ mp though , but not with the distance that are common for Republi@@ can candidates within the federal state . &quot;
as end@@ anger@@ ed also Arizona and Georgia .
&quot; in an interview of the Senate CNB@@ C answered Tru@@ mp to the question , as he had to stop the Vor@@ st@@ sch Clin@@ ton again : &quot; just as I have made it so far . &quot;
&quot; and ob : this will be &quot; either successful , &quot; or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
&quot; he do nothing else , as &quot; the truth to tell . &quot;
&quot; if it does not work for him at the end of the sake of the political correc@@ t@@ ness , be that in order , said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to the press , the party Tru@@ mp should be pus@@ hed to date back to the support of his election campaign , he should not present any better conversion . &quot;
instead of you want to access the candidates of the Republi@@ can for the Congress to the arms .

we always say that it is very diverse .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and their mel@@ ody .
it is a wonderful mix to the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we have Bern@@ st@@ eins music really in our blood !
in this st@@ aging Bart@@ oli plays a older ge@@ wor@@ e Maria .
she re@@ minds with mad@@ ness to her favorite with Tony while the younger Maria plays and dance .
the role of Mary has always fascin@@ ated me .
&quot; first , because they are musi@@ cally exceptional ! &quot;
and then it would be Mari@@ as personality .
&quot; it says it in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
&quot; so she is clever , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; she res@@ em@@ bles me very , my Italian character which I as Rö@@ mer@@ in , laugh@@ ing Bart@@ oli . &quot;
&quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is full of worship for the band , &quot; Cec@@ ilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor to work with her .
it is a trem@@ endous person .
and Bart@@ oli gives the compli@@ ment back : &quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conduc@@ ting is a necessity for him .
&quot; one sees it in every one of his movements , in his ga@@ ze , it is his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheer@@ ful approach to life , that is at all very important ! &quot;

they are the same issues and they are just as pron@@ ounc@@ ed as at that time .

&quot; who does not fit and Er@@ dog@@ an pra@@ ises out , sitting on uphol@@ ster@@ ed trunk , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
&quot; the Kur@@ dish community of Germany are aimed at short notice with tens of thousands of shel@@ ters , from Turkey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; medium @-@ term could even be some hundred thousand , believe the composite Ali top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; due to the hard approach to the Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Er@@ dog@@ an after the put@@ ty , the Kur@@ dish community is expected to be a mass cur@@ sed by Germany . &quot;
&quot; at short notice , I expect tens of thousands of protection from Turkey in Germany when the Er@@ dog@@ an regime fought the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the composite leading Ali top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; world &quot; of Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government have moved to Kur@@ dish , be 500,000 Kur@@ ds within Turkey on the run . &quot;
after the inher@@ ited put@@ sch leu@@ ka@@ emia and op@@ position@@ est ethnic Tur@@ ks .
&quot; many are new to do in Europe , if they are going to be oppressed in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it cannot be that a state that even refugees takes , in their own country refugees , &quot; &quot; said top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the campaign was def@@ end@@ ent of the settlement of Syrian Arab , but in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities . &quot;
with this I want to increase Er@@ dog@@ an to increase the export @-@ pressure on the remaining cur@@ sion .
&quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Gre@@ eks have been extinc@@ t in the last hundred years or , said top@@ ra@@ k , who is also CD@@ U @-@ member . &quot;
the ver@@ and@@ sch@@ ef requested that the federal government should be positioned as sharp as Austria against Er@@ dog@@ an and its trailer .
also in Germany there is a &quot; Hex@@ en@@ jag@@ d &quot; against Er@@ dog@@ an cri@@ tics .
I do not feel safe in the last few months for the first time in Germany .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len @-@ movement also fear@@ ed the flight of many towers to abroad .
&quot; more Tur@@ ks are looking for A@@ sy@@ l in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Opp@@ osi@@ tion@@ elle . &quot;
the bur@@ ns as a Gü@@ len @-@ suppor@@ ters were destroyed by teachers and other academ@@ ics for professional existence .
&quot; who does not fit and acqu@@ aint@@ ances , s@@ alt@@ ed , sitting on pressed coff@@ ers , by the way , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ oriented foundation of dialogue and education , the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper reported the newspaper on figures from the Federal Ministry of Finance , the Tur@@ ks were already the biggest group of the vote of political persecution of recognized A@@ syl@@ ust in Germany . &quot;
&quot; on June 30 , this was 11.@@ 386 people and thus almost 29 percent of all recognized as as@@ yl@@ ons recognised ( 39.@@ 625 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , they do not find the war , poverty or perspective . &quot;
&quot; as@@ yl@@ um entitled to the principle of law only politically , therefore by state @-@ of @-@ government , individually persec@@ uted . &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; where to go , where it hur@@ ts &quot;
&quot; stran@@ gers Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the loc@@ als receive nothing from the Summer @-@ election with - and the holiday@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ West@@ ph@@ alia must not choose the land@@ day . &quot;
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they have understood .
2021 will not take place the day@@ time election at the end of the summer holidays , the heavy parliament has already agreed to the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; for more than so far there are not : summer holidays , heat and land@@ day fight - this is conf@@ used . &quot;
the loc@@ als who are to be convinced by the elect@@ ors are on vacation .
&quot; the most holiday@@ makers , who are in the countryside , on Us@@ edom , R@@ ügen , or Hid@@ den@@ see are not loc@@ als , therefore may not choose the land@@ day . &quot;
&quot; these come practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ pers to spread the post@@ ers , bal@@ lo@@ ons , bal@@ lo@@ ons , fl@@ yers and pass at the end of the voices , only m@@ ug@@ ev@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; until 4 September 2016 , the vote and last village of Feri@@ ent@@ ag , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has once again to pass by Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern once again . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can tell us at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear for his office . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , since 1998 stron@@ gest party , is now obvious in uph@@ eav@@ als clearly behind the CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; exciting , how strong Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D is cut off and what remains at the end of co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ist aug@@ uries . &quot;
&quot; cel@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 leaders , makes an almost incon@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous choices , you can see from his grand@@ children . &quot;
&quot; he trav@@ elled through land , spread ro@@ ses and pl@@ ush a little with the people , as well as it was his legend@@ ary liter@@ ary pre@@ de@@ cess@@ or Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff . &quot;
otherwise the soul got cold feet and there is ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel st@@ eas@@ ing at the flower@@ ing of the Af@@ D .
&quot; your re@@ fuge@@ e policy , &quot; &quot; We are creating the &quot; &quot; rise of the right @-@ op@@ uli@@ sts acceler@@ ates what it will now be a beautiful post . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with their nickname , the Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make the wrong time at the right place of campaigns . &quot;
she invited twice ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel and Merkel st@@ akes at the Nor@@ the@@ ast .
&quot; but the target @-@ agreed not , there were more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berliner and Saxony as M@@ eckl@@ en@@ burger and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; def@@ endants Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently at N@@ DR . &quot;
but there is also any@@ body to listen to anyone from other cor@@ ners of Germany once Angela Merkel .
&quot; otherwise , the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U largely un@@ tains to the usual v@@ oting on market@@ ings and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbr@@ ell@@ as and bal@@ lo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; so , co@@ conut , play only a &quot; sub@@ ordin@@ ated role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; also the Union has master@@ ed that you have to go away in the land the base , that it must be very cont@@ agi@@ ous to find a wire to the people again . &quot;
&quot; it goes like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens , in the midst of the land hardly there . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U choices are co@@ aches to his collabor@@ ations , but also self @-@ dis@@ lar@@ v@@ ating : &quot; you have to go there where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Gol@@ den@@ e Wed@@ dings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because a lot of it stands on the game , Sell@@ ering has now called for a particularly eng@@ ag@@ ed elect@@ oral campaign . &quot;
in lines the Socialists and Democrats last with 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just just before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
the SPD still had won the SPD yet with 35,@@ 6 percent in front of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
&quot; the green , small part@@ ing with seven percent in the sur@@ veys , is likely to create the jump in the land@@ day . &quot;
they make a modern virtu@@ e of the holiday need a modern virtu@@ e and wei@@ gh their elect@@ oral competition into the internet .
&quot; online @-@ election , &quot; calls it the country @-@ president Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green choices give rise to tra@@ ce @-@ search for native atmosph@@ eres among the vac@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the Spitz@@ enk@@ an@@ did@@ atin , kur@@ v@@ t straight with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg Lake District and also find it nice . &quot;
&quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a pun@@ ishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ san@@ itation : tours suffer from block@@ ing
&quot; at the rap@@ idity , with which the B 27 is sandy , there is nothing to angular . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible persons involved in the morning we start at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and only at 20 o &apos;clock , there is all@@ enth@@ al@@ ben praise . &quot;
&quot; these have done everything quite z@@ ack@@ ig , &quot; tells El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff by the jet station . &quot;
this is a Super@@ team .
there is also no re@@ treat .
&quot; the construction site could be moved on week@@ ends at half time as scheduled to south end , until the end of October is to be ready . &quot;
&quot; blessed shall also be the face of those responsible for construction workers , for example when it comes to the establishment of Beh@@ r@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site , on Monday to the south and the block@@ ing of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße was raised in Of@@ ter@@ dingen who also has the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg , the traffic situation within the place is relaxed . &quot;
the citizens now can run from Of@@ ter@@ dingen who go back to the B 27 again .
the tight@@ ening traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were some significant dis@@ comfort , &quot; says that the organiz@@ ational management of the renovation leader of Florian King . &quot;
&quot; the associ@@ ates of wag@@ on road , Stein@@ r@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many sl@@ ings su@@ stain and rather their Nav@@ i confidence as the sign@@ age . &quot;
what led that man@@ cher lies in residential @-@ areas .
&quot; as the speed of speed can not be respected , the con@@ gregation will rein@@ force the measure from Mö@@ ss@@ ingen . &quot;
&quot; there was considerable cross@@ ings , &quot; says King , who made himself the location on the location . &quot;
there were already two to three per minute .
the quick@@ est was on the way with 77 st@@ und@@ o@@ omet@@ ers at the pace @-@ 30 zone .
&quot; since the construction site is held , but it has become qui@@ eter . &quot;
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small dru@@ mmer that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg can now open the road again .
in the cards the business@@ men will not let myself be happy .
&quot; but that the B 27 @-@ san@@ itation has led to them revenue , anyone lets you see . &quot;
&quot; however , some more and some less affected . &quot;
&quot; who has fewer to do with the &quot; &quot; end customers &quot; , &quot; so for other companies , for which the sanitary hardly consequences . &quot;
&quot; also at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Ma@@ ier , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; at most easy decl@@ ine , &quot; but also a that of course &quot; the customiz@@ ations is missing . &quot;
the stron@@ gest explo@@ ited are local along the road .
&quot; J. Albert g@@ öhn@@ er , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ent @-@ threat@@ ening .
not only him but everyone got it hard .
&quot; lack@@ ed the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil . &quot;
we must be glad about every Euro turnover .
&quot; revenue can be found on &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot;
the road ten@@ ds have thro@@ wn his operation &quot; by two years . &quot;
half of his staff have to be released .
&quot; if I would have had a company with 4000 employees , and half would have been abandoned , the policy would have been different . &quot;
&quot; instead , President Jörg Schmidt on a request of g@@ öhn@@ er , whether it could give a financial balance , with the reference , and otherwise the advantages of the situation on the B 27 Now they also give the dis@@ advantages that arise from the renov@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; g@@ ing@@ ers knows from other farmers , where something has been negoti@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; at all compla@@ int , he is very sure that his food itself will stand . &quot;
&quot; finally , the family run is already settled since 17@@ 15 , he pro@@ ves to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other regul@@ ars are now less frequent because of the complex transport performance less often , it can understand . &quot;
&quot; if one can not go down , it is also elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; for the end of the recovery process came back after the end of the sanitary , it has no doubt . &quot;
&quot; despite the c@@ rises with B@@ SE and bird , the impact of the B 27 @-@ construction works on its clients for the greatest crisis that has experienced his food in their long @-@ standing history . &quot;
six months construction work that is already bru@@ tal .
in the name of the terror@@ ist fighting for laws .
&quot; after the latest attacks , the Minister of Ma@@ izi@@ ère presents a thick@@ er package . &quot;
but what does a Dul@@ se status have to do with ter@@ ror ?
and what does the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ists say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the Com@@ promis@@ ers .
&quot; all his suggestions are politically especially since the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ists , &quot; says the Federal Minister of Finance in the presentation of his new security package . &quot;
they do not request any@@ body .
&quot; others , further points would first be discussed within the parties . &quot;
I also pastry me .
but the Minister of Foreign Minister he was on results and in a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able con@@ sen@@ sus &quot; within the Co@@ alition .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère has a little time to store his conclusions in Würzburg &apos;s and Ans@@ bach before he presents his conclusions to security in the Republic .
but this is falling so extensive .
&quot; some is already known to announce that a new Security authorities to take care of the cr@@ ack @-@ key communication , is not new . &quot;
&quot; also , not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU specifications for flight @-@ information and c@@ eas@@ e@@ fire . &quot;
the call for more video sur@@ veillance and staff for safety authorities is also not surprising .
&quot; partially , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère will not start a second starting point for proposals to put together with the SPD . he wants to face sympath@@ etic index under pun@@ ishment and ji@@ hadi@@ sts with dou@@ bled ci@@ tiz@@ ens@@ hip by the German pass . &quot;
&quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; sp@@ atial the CD@@ U man . &quot;
&quot; however , he nonetheless hold this for reasonable and challeng@@ ed nothing that have no chances for the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ists . &quot;
a few new ideas presents de Ma@@ izi@@ ère .
they have partly in themselves : it plans quick procedures for deport@@ ation and more possibilities for the ar@@ rest of people before the deport@@ ation .
&quot; refugees who are targeted into the country before their smartphones allow to release their smartphones , and social @-@ media accounts for a safety re@@ consideration . &quot;
&quot; at Dul@@ les as@@ yl@@ um as@@ yl@@ um seek@@ ers , he wants to make some worse still worse than so far - about such that imp@@ acts or papers are aware of their identity to wear their identity . &quot;
some of them is political and legally protected .
it is also still un@@ balanced and leaves nothing to be open .
and at some points - in the ine@@ treatment of ge@@ dul@@ ar for example - imagine the question : what does it actually have to do with security and ter@@ ror ?
&quot; yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the topics of refugees and ter@@ ror . &quot;
&quot; but it cannot be ass@@ essed in abund@@ ance , that the ass@@ ass@@ ettes of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg refugees were . &quot;
&quot; moreover , many people were worried about high re@@ fuge@@ e issues to security . &quot;
&quot; and things that make people deeply committed , but left now in elect@@ or@@ less times . &quot;
the internal safety is enormous in the focus .
&quot; the proposals in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the un@@ locking is great .
&quot; and yes , there are choices . &quot;
Union and SPD are therefore growing in position on the subject of internal security .
in the past few days they went up between the two parties .
&quot; only a gar@@ age@@ ous disp@@ ute over the equipment of the federal police , then on a safety policy ideas @-@ collection of some Uni@@ ons @-@ Minister , in which the res@@ ch@@ efs also call a bur@@ ka ban and a turn of the double ci@@ tiz@@ ens@@ hip . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also here for re@@ conc@@ iled tones .
from a turn of the double @-@ pass it comes nothing .
we talked about the discussion in Germany .
you are new to do is not mean@@ ing@@ ful .
and with a Bur@@ ka ban it was constitu@@ tional concern .
&quot; whether his own package is constitu@@ tional , and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; especially &quot; &quot; for the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ists , has to still be shown . &quot;
there is some dr@@ in what could make disp@@ ute .
&quot; however , the SPD is currently trying to establish itself in the subject of internal security . &quot;
&quot; Part@@ age Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ ali@@ zes only first of convers@@ ing call and says , &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase safety . &quot;
it is even Volkswagen gli@@ mp@@ y .
&quot; despite diesel engines , the suppliers are worldwide . &quot;
but not in all markets it runs round .
in case of retri@@ ev@@ ing there is activity for a term .
Volkswagen starts with the delivery periods in the second half of the year .
&quot; in the previous year , in recent accounts , in the previous year , despite the diesel aff@@ air thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ taking markets continue to be a plus . &quot;
&quot; but in July he was weak@@ ened the core brand VW above all in Western Europe , and charged with the sale of such as that in the D@@ ax not@@ ed companies . &quot;
the brand VW is sold in July with 4@@ 49@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the pre @-@ year mon@@ at .
&quot; in Western Europe alone , according to China the second most important market , the sales stood 14 per cent below the pre @-@ year mon@@ at . &quot;
in the home market Germany the deliveries of almost a hex@@ agon .
Tra@@ deshow Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weak@@ ening figures from July above all on two week@@ days less in Europe .
&quot; in addition , there have been a purchase order in some core markets by &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the put@@ ty , in Turkey also the British V@@ ot@@ um was charged to the Austr@@ itt from the EU , explained a speaker . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the exhaust @-@ aff@@ air@@ es first es@@ cal@@ ated , is also further a minus to Bu@@ che . &quot;
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; in total , the affected brand name of the Lower Saxony @-@ based gli@@ der in further gli@@ de @-@ sc@@ andal : after the first seven months is only a delivery of 0,@@ 9 percent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles to be@@ ech . &quot;
CE@@ F Fred Kap@@ pler able to forward a concert in January from January to July .
&quot; 1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen in this period , worldwide 5,@@ 904 million . &quot;
Volkswagen had manip@@ ulated with a software distribut@@ or .
&quot; alone in Germany , VW around 2,5 million cars to switch to the retro@@ fitting into the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of retro@@ fitting , VW , that the conversion of cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after change@@ over the vehicles give it in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine no det@@ eri@@ oration . &quot;
&quot; the car office is based on the customer after the conversion a &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; certificate , but not of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was called on Friday in the company . &quot;
reason are legal enti@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; focus &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen grant his German customers now a guarantee of group@@ ed diesel models . &quot;
this would have confirmed the last Monday of VW representatives in the Federal Ministry .
&quot; from the end of the end of the Federal Ministry was confirmed , that this meeting was held . &quot;
&quot; VW has to fulfil the requirements of my investig@@ ators , and to fulfill the KBA . &quot;
&quot; discre@@ pan@@ cies are not accepted , &quot; the German Minister Alexander do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( C@@ SU ) according to the Ministry . &quot;
VW has the guarantee assumed that for fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor power according to the change@@ over no det@@ eri@@ or@@ ations will take place and all typ@@ ing relevant vehicle values un@@ changed . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; but not as it was in business trips . &quot;
&quot; with the wide term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; Volkswagen the opportunity to return that customers for example a half year after the conversion in a workshop - and this can lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; also in the customer interest , it is important to avoid that there is with any other damage , which does not have nothing to do with the sc@@ andal . concerning possible warranty rules , as it was called . &quot;
&quot; therefore , VW is not using the term &quot; guarantee &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the ra@@ i@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from rich au@@ sterity - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; ban@@ ker Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; it is just about 139 customers , who parking 40 million euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily dose . &quot;
the German Association of German banks speaks of an individual case and does not see a signal : normal au@@ sterity &quot; would not be fear@@ ed to pay for their au@@ sterity .
&quot; bearings will pay money on the night at the European Central Bank ( EC@@ B ) , they must pay her 0.4 per cent . &quot;
this fee is calling for the ra@@ i@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate clients for deposits over 100@@ .000 Euro on Gi@@ ro@@ - or day@@ light .
&quot; the first 100@@ .000 Euro are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100@@ .000 costs in the future 400 Euro per year , &quot; said Paul . &quot;
&quot; he stro@@ ked up 40 million euros , which could be removed from one day on the other and which he could not be interpre@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; they are in me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 per cent costs , &quot; said the ban@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; I can not lie for every million 4000 Euros . &quot;
the costs shall be sent after the per@@ petrators are now further .
&quot; the money can be easily seen in the saf@@ es of the ra@@ i@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank would be much too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four survi@@ ves , I am not yet the fifth ! &quot; &quot; said the ban@@ ker . &quot;
most customers have had understanding and is rarely on other forms of forms .
only a few hi@@ kes to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; co @-@ oper@@ atives of Bavaria explained : &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the EC@@ B causes significant costs . &quot;
&quot; carry alone , be &quot; business permanently not possible . &quot;
&quot; some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account , credit cards or transfer . &quot;
&quot; with pen@@ c@@ els for deposits of three million euros had made the Thuring@@ ian folk and ra@@ i@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Country with their skat@@ ebo@@ arding branches , 2014 &quot;
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , chief executive director of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t expect that private clients must pay for deposits , this is the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks much too strong . &quot;
&quot; ban@@ ker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a cli@@ ent@@ el , which is equipped with a little l@@ ush . &quot;
&quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , if they are free of charge . &quot;
&quot; the 1911 @-@ founded Geneva Motor G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ sp@@ ago @-@ E@@ ach , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; in the region , well @-@ known actor , ath@@ letes and entrepreneur@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the co @-@ oper@@ atives of Bavaria &quot; are currently not yet known for further banks that calculate one ex@@ position for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; said spok@@ es@@ man . &quot;
&quot; the President of the German Civil and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank ( Bv@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had at the end of June : &quot; the th@@ res@@ hold to go towards the neg@@ atives , is very high . &quot;
&quot; the competition is hard , and it threat@@ ens the migration from investors to competition . &quot;
customers in Germany shall not be noticed in the width .
Dest@@ ination plates : who did actually buy Bell plates ?
lon@@ ely men middle ages love panels .
&quot; before you hur@@ ry to the comment on the p@@ seud@@ onym , for him under the p@@ seud@@ onym of non @-@ al@@ ysis , this statement leads from the current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the variety of sound plates is not attri@@ buted to a boom in Mill@@ enni@@ als , who want to welcome the re@@ alism of physical objects , but to bring back to Mid@@ life @-@ no@@ stal@@ gia . &quot;
those recently bought a record are of all advance after the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most un@@ prob@@ able group .
it is also not a hor@@ des due to Hob@@ b@@ ys@@ amm@@ ers - it has an emotional significance : older records run@@ ners keep their feelings rather for himself ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it to spend their own time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; if this blog would be a news report on television , I would follow me the camera while I consider the midst of a busy road in So@@ ho , a mod@@ est ascent to stop and wild@@ ly say like : &quot; &quot; so , let us take a close look at it . &quot;
&quot; so , let us take a look to it . &quot;
&quot; even if the heart of So@@ hos is slow in his charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once an independent seller - there are still a hand@@ ful fantas@@ tical turn@@ tables . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the camera to turn out the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and soul . &quot;
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , which I have from S@@ ister Ray ( data cells : two men middle ages , one woman , probably around the 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill out the few hours . &quot;
is he a collectors I ask ?
&quot; I already appreciate , &quot; says he . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3@@ ,000 or 4@@ ,000 plates . &quot;
&quot; this sound fl@@ ats , above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I am not followed him at home ) , dress the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he poss@@ esses such a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of its available income : it is now able to buy plates , which he could not afford to buy them , when he was released , as he was young and pl@@ ast@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; many things I bought , are from the late 60 &apos;s , early 70s , who appeared as I was 11 or 12 . things I probably have something to be young to buy them , &quot; says he . &quot;
&quot; he agre@@ es to those that are buying , more intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend their own time and add : &quot; I smoke not much and I would not drink very much . &quot;
this is my L@@ aster .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at S@@ ister Ray , also believes that many customers who meets the You@@ Go@@ v &apos;s Profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he also noticed a new wave of people who have influenced by the Medi@@ enh@@ pe , people who have heard over the com@@ eback and let go back to buy their old records . &quot;
&quot; from the convers@@ ations that I have led , people usually did as a rule in 1998 or 1999 of their collection . &quot;
&quot; customers who once used their records sold to buy CDs , now sell their CDs to buy their records once again . &quot;
this would be the boom of follow@@ ers of a particular age .
but what about the all@@ eged emotional significance of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like Phon@@ ica to ack@@ n@@ owledge that turn@@ out a so@@ othing community of indi@@ ges@@ inn@@ s .
&quot; according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers participated in contact@@ less payments system . &quot;
some turn@@ table fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and would like to withdraw to the stability of trust sound@@ tracks , of objects , the happ@@ i@@ ful ju@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a vo@@ id or the possession of the pos@@ sessions of the pos@@ sessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot;
this is for me as collectors and I think it is so for many people .
it is a simple way to deal ment@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social worker ! &quot; &quot; have a staff of a plat@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; a survey of IC@@ M in April announce that nearly 50 % of people who bought this month a record , they have not yet been stopped . &quot;
&quot; the survey also found that 41 % have a turn@@ tables that they never use , while 7 % of those who own a record , no turn@@ tables . &quot;
&quot; at this time of the report , I would probably look very worried while I formed by a stack at Bos@@ sa Nova compil@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works in Sounds of the Universe ( Data : three Man middle ages ) , has noticed a &quot; &quot; trop@@ hy &quot; of re@@ vi@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; someone recently came here and said , &quot; &quot; I got no turn@@ tables , but I would like to buy a radio record , so I would like to ask them into the shelf , &quot; says he . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it is definitely going to happen . &quot;

&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ agers and women middle ages . &quot;
even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the afor@@ emen@@ tion@@ ed shops - Wild Be@@ asts &apos;s Syn@@ thesi@@ zers and sex@@ be@@ pack@@ er Pop instead of experim@@ ental jazz instead of the loud@@ speakers - it is good to see such a diversity among clients .

&quot; she does not deser@@ ve much , so the coll@@ ecting panels are not a real option , says it . &quot;
it costs much .
it is easy to hear music from a computer or to listen to other way but the beauty of plates is ... they drives with a dec@@ eived s@@ eu@@ f@@ zer .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it is really unique .
&quot; my last stop is a shop , from which it is said that a new generation of turn@@ tables have to be inspired : urban out@@ fit@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; while I give up the sh@@ allow , to watch the je@@ ans hot@@ line , I watch a group of young teen@@ ager to group@@ ing for a moment to buy Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter to buy a cros@@ ley turn@@ tables . &quot;
&quot; on the left there is a stair@@ case , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; no one sees it - maybe because they are only purely decorative , some so far above it is impossible to address them . &quot;
&quot; it is pure &quot; &quot; wind@@ ing &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but considering that every attraction for these items mean more money to the industry and to send some customers to the dep@@ ths of So@@ hos for more , there is nothing to compla@@ in to compla@@ in . &quot;
&quot; there is no surprise that a population group which has more time and money than others , also the one is to most suitable for Lux@@ or areas like plates . &quot;

French Court re@@ jo@@ icing on dem@@ olition of shops in the jungle of refugees
&quot; a French court has rej@@ ected an offer of the authorities in Calais , do@@ z@@ ens of pro@@ visional businesses and restaurants in the jungle of Calais , to live in the thousands of refugees . &quot;
&quot; at a court proceedings this week ar@@ gu@@ ed the authorities in Calais that the state should be approved , 72 pro@@ visional Shops , sell cigar@@ ettes to En@@ erg@@ ydr@@ inks , sell , hair@@ dres@@ sing services or tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in pro@@ visional restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Calais ar@@ gu@@ ed that these places should be con@@ ger@@ ed , because they would be a parallel economy out of which no taxes be paid , and that is a fire and re@@ generation . &quot;
humanitarian groups shared the court with that the shops and restaurants are important as the free meals provided by the state supported union and other groups are not offered enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also realized that the pro@@ visional business and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the exp@@ ul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 pro@@ visional business , but dre@@ amed that the concerns of the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Calais . &quot;
&quot; Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that the gro@@ cery stores , cafes and restaurants are a much greater role to feed , who live in extremely pre@@ datory conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas in quiet places of refugees between refugees and volunte@@ ers offer .
&quot; one of the places , which was threatened by the ra@@ ises was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café des Lag@@ gers , which is operated by a non @-@ sal@@ acious and 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as a consultation on as@@ yl@@ um , un@@ accompanied minor @-@ year in the camp . &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Trailer
&quot; Germany &apos;s ras@@ er must set up to the next generation of speed : in various federal states , among other things in Hessen and Brandenburg , new light@@ ers are tested , which are particularly effective . &quot;
the fut@@ ur@@ istic acting En@@ forcement Trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example an accident speci@@ als where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
&quot; for example , on highway construction sites or to renov@@ ating bridges , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure there with a stationary se@@ ater for the compliance of speed . &quot;
but a lasting mobili@@ er structure can however be too dangerous or elabor@@ ate .
En@@ forcement trailer is aut@@ ark : his battery keeps at un@@ inter@@ rupted mess@@ enger operations five days , the falling dates are encryp@@ ted via a modem . &quot;
&quot; with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be det@@ ected over several tracks simultaneously . &quot;
&quot; variable speed , as well as di@@ arr@@ he@@ a according to time , driving and vehicle class can also be monitor@@ ed . &quot;
in the high @-@ prop@@ elled condition you can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with each car with trailer coupling .
&quot; so that he is not simply cl@@ oned , it is reduced in the exhibition operation , so the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and by the way also sh@@ iny out@@ lets disappear . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the se@@ ater from Vand@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer are tested by Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used . &quot;
&quot; also foreign authorities comp@@ rising with the new technology : younger than France has proven 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
&quot; great Britain takes silver in the 7 @-@ er Rugby , after Fiji Master@@ class Gold takes &quot;
&quot; the impressive performance of Britain at the 7 @-@ er Rugby arrived at the fin@@ als on Thursday night at a ab@@ rupt hold in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they have been cut down in Rio de @-@ 7 at the De@@ odoro Stadium in Rio . &quot;
&quot; Fiji ert@@ ed a master@@ class in the handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , re@@ wards , lin@@ ing and ro@@ wer force to gain gold - their first Olympi@@ am@@ ed@@ aille of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was caused by not too bad Tro@@ st@@ preis der Silber@@ med@@ aille - Great Britain &apos;s fourth to this day - and they could not be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the distinct defeat of the bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the half @-@ final day could go back to her in the fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; but regardless of this form , Fiji on this form have been a 15 @-@ man team in order . &quot;
&quot; it could be a con@@ st for GB - but it is likely not - that at least a br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold med@@ al for his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is Che@@ ek@@ rainer Ben Ry@@ an , the former chef for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind himself .
eight years ago she lost under Ry@@ an every game with the Adel@@ a@@ ide Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
&quot; this sn@@ appe becomes we@@ ht@@ un , but the progress is amazing . &quot;
&quot; Fiji started mir@@ ac@@ ed , and made the attacks of GB@@ s out of fun . &quot;
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co . on , when you run in driving buses . the World Series winners went up to 5 @-@ 0 , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner . &quot;
with four minutes playing time Jerry Tu@@ w@@ ai added another attack from the right corner to turn it .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly got the ball .
&quot; a h@@ ev@@ or@@ rag@@ ed T@@ ackle of Mitchell stops the mountain of Mann Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa , but it has just stopped . &quot;
in the seventh minute the Jas@@ a Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a in the right corner has a touch@@ down and there was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
&quot; Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the good@@ bye , and there was still over one minute playing time ... in the first half . &quot;
V@@ at@@ emo Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ ses through further weak Sl@@ ackl@@ ing of the GB teams and stor@@ ms up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
&quot; it &apos;s so , as if Fiji was born , the 7 to play , while GB still have forgotten . &quot;
so it is too .
&quot; GB led basic changes to the half @-@ time due to and completed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half time , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went after a brilliant inter@@ play of Fiji . &quot;
&quot; Dan N@@ orton started an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game ran already long in favour of the south @-@ one , whose fans went sang , fa@@ sting and d@@ anced on the tri@@ bun@@ es . &quot;
it was not hard to admire the play@@ ful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a Vi@@ li@@ ame made the i @-@ bag with another try in the last seconds .
&quot; the fi@@ f@@ ff @-@ ray , the f@@ j@@ is imp@@ over@@ ished , and GB k@@ ick@@ ed cont@@ end up in the lawn . &quot;
&quot; earlier on the day , Fiji Japan had been defe@@ ated in the semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Great Britain in a scar@@ ce semi @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference . &quot;
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the boats in the first half to the front , but Dan N@@ orton , the line with an impressive foot work and achieved a gate among the post in the second half . &quot;
a brilliant late T@@ ackl@@ ing by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ related teams , secured the prize - and thus the silver med@@ al . &quot;
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning through battle with the cancer of the trainer to the ro@@ wing si@@ ege
there will be no em@@ ot@@ eric gold than with these games and that wants to be hot .
&quot; from the first ro@@ wers to the last , 220 hard h@@ ieve , who go into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in its golden moment at Est@@ aci@@ o da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even if it was only those who were on the rod , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the Train@@ ers Robin Williams , was all present as they put on the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in second without tax woman , the first women in the history of British Sports , which laid one on such a scale . &quot;
&quot; your domin@@ ance was absolutely , at least their 39.@@ ter invali@@ d use , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant ath@@ letes , which slide over the surface with the elegance of weak@@ ness , which does not reflect the type of tri@@ umph . &quot;
&quot; behind each gold in the ro@@ wing , a batt@@ ali@@ on does not contribute to the incre@@ mental progress that would not know the difference and there was no one help if he would not survive this day when he was diagnos@@ ed with cancer . &quot;
as he said he was ris@@ ky .
&quot; I had blad@@ der cancer , which is op@@ eri@@ als and they did it . &quot;
if you do not do this is spreading everywhere .
it would have been a fairly bad situation .
it changed a bit of the out@@ look .
Williams was diagnos@@ ed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio was lucky that he was the beginning of 2014 , out of the season , starting out what the break @-@ up was kept to a minimum if that under such circumstances is the right term . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go back again soon . &quot;
it was an incen@@ tive .
&quot; I was in hospital and ran on the station around 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps should be enough . &quot;
so it begins .
&quot; the ro@@ wing of itself is already a challenge , but this makes it a greater . &quot;
&quot; in the im@@ balance of the sight@@ ing , their first thoughts on Williams , who went an ner@@ ve morning to talk a little more than usual and tried to process his own f@@ ears . &quot;
&quot; St@@ anning , which was as Haupt@@ mann in the Royal Arti@@ ll@@ ery regi@@ ment in an action in Afghanistan , &quot; I was this week an emotional wre@@ ck . that &apos;s maybe something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it just repe@@ at@@ edly , how much to me this means , how much I and Helen and also worked in Robin . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we would be a massive Th@@ ank you to him . he is the best coach of the world . &quot;
I would not have any better person for exercis@@ ing or better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have no race lost during the last five years .
&quot; the couple had a hard rhythm , with which their opponents could not work with it . &quot;
&quot; even in the last 500 metres , when teams from New Zealand and Denmark settled , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had a lot in reserve . &quot;
we were very at the moment cap@@ tured .
&quot; Helen called &quot; , &quot; in the process , in the process . &quot;
it is really important to ignore themselves .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking out to make something great .
&quot; we did not want a fire@@ works , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race which we did . &quot;
the pair will take a time for a year before it will make decisions about his future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver has to appear next week at a wedding , their own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she wants to enjoy the moment you simply .
I did not want to say that my last race was .
this would have been too much pressure .
&quot; in London it took about six months , to compre@@ h@@ end that I am a Olympi@@ ast@@ eg@@ ress . &quot;
it was all so new to me and I was so st@@ ressed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; this feels so much better , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;

&quot; member community are the churches of Kirch@@ lau@@ ter , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the City of Ba@@ un@@ ah . &quot;
for further towns and municip@@ alities there are water @-@ deliveries .
&quot; the current chair , lati@@ tu@@ ns civil champion@@ ship Gertru@@ d B@@ üh@@ l ( FW ) , rem@@ ind@@ ed that Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler was set in 1985 as a water supply and was already appointed to the managing director of the kenn@@ el Association since 1988 . &quot;
&quot; its tasks have been very diverse and they extend from the water @-@ conduc@@ ting and maintenance work on office and organis@@ ational activities , the budget of fees and lectures up to emer@@ gency purposes of week@@ ends , &quot; &quot; said the president . &quot;
&quot; as outstanding events , she called the commissioning and initi@@ ation of the new fountain ( 1994 ) and compensation of farmers ( 1999 ) and compensation of a central Computer control ( 2004 ) and the participation of water@@ lines . &quot;

he is the best water @-@ go@@ al@@ ke@@ eper and he was a loy@@ al boy .

as highlights from his point of view he was the fountain and the re@@ struc@@ turing of the kenn@@ el .
but the biggest challenge and the tou@@ gh@@ est use were the pipe @-@ break at Kirch@@ lau@@ ter at a 3rd of January .
&quot; here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night , so the loc@@ alities could be supplied with water . &quot;

steel - Light@@ view for German steel industry
the calibr@@ ated and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains the additional cost in millimeters .
financial bur@@ dens to the industry from the Ö@@ ko@@ strom fo@@ ster are from the table .
&quot; it will be in the liber@@ ation of renewable energy sector in the German steel industry , the Federal Minister of Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Fri@@ days edition ) . &quot;
I &apos;m really glad that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years .
&quot; the European Commission had initially planned , the steel manufacturer , the gas@@ es coming from the Ho@@ cho@@ fen to the power production for its own consumption , to the check@@ out . &quot;
the steel industry threat@@ ens the additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , I will now give a ground@@ work with the EU Commission to discussions with competitive Land@@ mis@@ sar@@ in Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ amp . &quot;
&quot; only when the generators will be replaced in the steel drives , f@@ alle a E@@ EG re@@ position of 20 percent . &quot;
but even this will not be raised in steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed the agreement in Germany with the European Commission on the shareholders .
the status qu@@ o the status of the existing regulation will be largely defined .
particular significance have the successful effort of Gabriel for steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; Steel &quot; &quot; is that a first step . &quot;

the steel industry has been suffering in Europe since the financial crisis of 2008 under brid@@ ging capacity and a considerable prize .
&quot; last year , the situation continues to be considered the world &apos;s world @-@ biggest inv@@ ig@@ or@@ ated China given the weak@@ est demand in steel on the world market . &quot;
European manufacturer throw Chinese steel concert dump@@ ing dump@@ ing .
in the course of this early years the situation has something relaxed .
&quot; to show a hang@@ ed un@@ authorized effect on imp@@ orter effects , on the other the economic prospects have occurred in China . &quot;
un@@ clear how lasting the pri@@ cing is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp remained on Thursday .
&quot; last , the prices were again rather stag@@ gering . &quot;
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further benefits .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp did not last to pass the closure of individual works .
in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 there were around 86@@ 000 people .
in July the German steel@@ works despite increasing prices and increasing orders carefully .
&quot; with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less density than in the pre @-@ year mon@@ at , like the economic union of steel on Friday . &quot;
after a short increase in May the crowd went back to the second month in May .
&quot; since the year , the production is available by two percent below the previous year . &quot;
the association expects an improved contract with a rising output .
&quot; community , Mind , Health : singing is good &quot;
&quot; singing has been accompanied by Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp for her whole life : as young girl she was in the school@@ choir , in the teacher @-@ university studying the F@@ ach music , and today s@@ ings the 78 @-@ year @-@ old in a seniors . &quot;
&quot; sing moves me - emotional , and physi@@ cally , describes it . &quot;
&quot; after a sample she feels spar@@ kling , cheer@@ ful and a total living , says it . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they do their health and spirit is something good . &quot;
&quot; because S@@ ingen is right from several perspectives a great hobby for seniors , says Er@@ hard H@@ ackl@@ er from the German Sen@@ i oren@@ liga . &quot;
most Sen@@ iors sang in the choir and share the joy of the music , describes the bl@@ ackl@@ er . &quot;
through the regular inter@@ play the seniors can make social contacts and maintain .
&quot; because often solve social and familiar structures at the age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience also has Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in their choir : &quot; to speak and organize , to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of existence . &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , says Sl@@ ackl@@ er . &quot;
because exercise is a deep and controlled breathing .
those who calls his lungs regularly even in daily life as soon as the buff@@ er .
&quot; even if it comes to preserve the sound of the voice in the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; on older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , Ursula L@@ enz explains from the German labour @-@ community of Sen@@ iors . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations the common sectors had a much higher position , it belong@@ ed to everyday life , both in school and leisure time , explained it . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz often observed that the singing or hearing of songs in older men many memories w@@ akes , often associated with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
due to Li@@ ed@@ tex@@ te and especially mel@@ o@@ dies de@@ duc@@ ing themselves hum@@ bled people in long back@@ wards events .
&quot; in singing , the head will also serve a special performance , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , to focus on their own voice and to a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cogni@@ tive challenge . &quot;
&quot; just el@@ derly people , who alone live , prac@@ tising in itself not just to focus on himself . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the acknowled@@ gement , which is going through singing in the choir , says Sl@@ ackl@@ er . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
also the self @-@ este@@ em is growing by singing in the choir .
&quot; to show themselves : if I have long for something , I will be better and wax@@ es beyond myself - this experience strength@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to begin with the singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; if you want to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he means , little talent to have ob@@ li@@ que . &quot;
&quot; you s@@ ings yes not alone - with 50 s@@ ings people who listen , if sometimes a tone is going on it ? &quot;
in search of the suitable offer Sen@@ iors various possibilities , says Sl@@ ackl@@ er . &quot;
sing someone out of the familiar circuit in a sen@@ i@@ oren@@ chor where you can simply connect .
many towns also offer views of the cho@@ irs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church of church can turn directly to the church or the church .
many sen@@ ior@@ ench@@ ers can also be found via the internet .
&quot; who has no access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighb@@ ours can ask for help in the internet . &quot;
&quot; who l@@ ust has to sing , should necessarily join a choir , betra@@ yed H@@ ackl@@ er . &quot;
singing does the soul well and has a bit of liber@@ ating - that applies to all ages .
Cats are able to react sensi@@ bler than K@@ ater on Schrei@@ e of the k@@ ittens
bi@@ ologists have been investig@@ ated in Hanover who has the action of fel@@ lows for adult animals .
&quot; at her surprise , the mist@@ r@@ ust left the males not cold - however , they kept in the difference to the females always the same . &quot;
female cats can recognize the arous@@ al of Stern@@ tal@@ ys at the tur@@ rets of the Kl@@ einen .
they respond to ten percent faster on Lau@@ te of k@@ ittens resulting in great need as scientists from the veterinary University and the Medical School of Hannover ( M@@ HH ) .
hang@@ s also react to the trunk of k@@ ittens - but always the same .
&quot; evi@@ d@@ ently , the acoustic differences between the mist@@ r@@ ust of less and strong Jung@@ le for the males are either not perc@@ eived or not of meaning , &quot; said the Biolog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the M@@ HH . &quot;
she is first of the study that was published on this Friday in the magazine &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ u@@ tionary Biology . &quot;
in an previous investigation the research team had already found that the duration and sound height of the k@@ ittens comp@@ lies with the ur@@ gency of its aid .
a total of nine adults and eight kis@@ ses from the animal position of the M@@ HH .
&quot; they were played for a pack of sounds , which were taken for three minutes from the throw @-@ box and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; to the other they were con@@ fron@@ ted with scre@@ ams of stronger k@@ ittens , which were additionally high@@ lighted . &quot;
the researchers hold their results despite the small sample @-@ tasting for pron@@ ounc@@ ed .
&quot; all females , even those who had no own offspring , re@@ acted differenti@@ ated to the scri@@ be , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
they turned up faster to the loud@@ speaker when this pack of the very rain@@ y k@@ ittens played .
this ability may be inn@@ ate or developing with the sex .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have respon@@ ded at all , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot;
in the past scientists have already investig@@ ated several times when people use the reactions of women and men in baby &apos;s gro@@ w@@ ages .
&quot; some studies showed that women are sensitive on inf@@ ants , regardless of whether they were already m@@ others or not reported the bi@@ ologist . &quot;

in Turkey is opposed to the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ cows .
he is cast out to be a member of a terror@@ ist group .
&quot; for the first time after Putin , Turkey will take place an important football match . &quot;
in front of the scent of the arch@@ riv@@ ets between sett@@ lers Istanbul and Luke Pod@@ ol@@ sk@@ is Gal@@ atas@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to super@@ vised the super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya the official line is clearly : &quot; business as usual . &quot;
&quot; already in the fix@@ ing of the em@@ ission level after the over@@ throw in July , the government , the daily life of nor@@ ms are not affected . &quot;
&quot; but this does not apply to those who are condem@@ ned to bear the movement of the pre@@ acher F@@ eth@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which makes it responsible for Putin . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the football will not be taken from football . &quot;
against the former Star@@ k@@ ick@@ er Hak@@ an Sü@@ pi@@ r placed the Prosec@@ ut@@ or of a sentence .
&quot; thus , this is being thro@@ wn in America in America , a member of a terror@@ ist group . &quot;
Sü@@ w@@ r should be the follow@@ er of the pre@@ acher F@@ eth@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len to be held responsible by the President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Er@@ dog@@ an for Putin .
&quot; this is first valid for 90 days prior to October , in addition to October , the life of most towers is as good as no effects . &quot;
the no@@ c@@ turn@@ al &quot; democracy @-@ gu@@ ards &quot; on public places throughout the country has been explained Er@@ dog@@ an on Wednesday for ends .
sport is - like the whole country - split in follow@@ ers and opponents Er@@ dog@@ an .
especially fans of the workers &quot; clubs population are traditionally not among the friends of the President .
what the Gro@@ s of the Tur@@ ks but given rise in view dram@@ atic experiences in history is the strict rej@@ ection of military co@@ aches .
there are even the fans her@@ y - regardless of whether you stri@@ kes his heart for gal@@ atas@@ ar@@ ay or sett@@ lers .
at Pok@@ al &quot; Gala &quot; it is especially going to arrive at Lukas po@@ dol@@ ski .
its sport@@ ing value presented the Köl@@ ner in the ex@@ pi@@ red season under proof : with 17 gates and nine templates in all the competitions the 31 @-@ year ended his first time as a pot of his association .
in the end game against F@@ ener@@ b@@ ah@@ ce he scor@@ ed the 1 : 0 @-@ seal .
the newspaper &quot; F@@ AN@@ A@@ TI@@ K &quot; be@@ ju@@ bel@@ lied him : &quot; he was the best in the place .
he has completed the season in excellent ways and secured his team the trop@@ hy .
&quot; thanks &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; found the dis@@ appointments for the record for the record master . &quot;
&quot; after the pre @-@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; Lions &apos; also differ@@ ed in the Europe League early . &quot;
in the South America it can only be made to rank six .
the season was not good .
the trop@@ hy was the only way to win something .
&quot; we have managed and that is the most important , &quot; &quot; said po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
for Master Population , the game ran better . &quot;
&quot; especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who set out the basis for the 14th title with 26 Seas@@ on@@ ings . &quot;
this is also the reason that fans hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year old .
&quot; at the age of AC , the AC Florence took place under the contract and to sett@@ les only to the put@@ ty Gom@@ ez after the put@@ ty , because of the political situation in the country after his EM @-@ holidays . &quot;
&quot; if Mario had to come to us , he just needs to say it , &quot; &quot; announced the magazine &quot; &quot; Kick@@ er &quot; &quot; Club@@ manager F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot;

despite dop@@ ing : these ath@@ letes have still med@@ als opportunities at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year anniversary Gat@@ lin was already locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Jan@@ eiro - W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa must not start in Rio
other ex@@ haus@@ tive athle@@ tics sin@@ ners can only lau@@ gh more about it - they are fighting in Rio about med@@ als .
the subject of Dop@@ ing is still the headlines in the Rio Games in Rio .
&quot; the Russian swimming pool Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ owa , which had taken off after a dop@@ ing sper@@ son , it was right just before playing , was taken up at their start ( 100 meters chest ) mer@@ cil@@ ess and explo@@ ited . &quot;
it offered a sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile scen@@ ery : with a few smile she was still in the hall and had a show with her appearance .
&quot; when set @-@ up , that they will not get gold broke down the audience into a wave @-@ tower . &quot;
yet there are many other sports@@ men who go to the start despite dop@@ ing past in Rio to the start .
here an overview :
&quot; Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ olds is one of the most contro@@ versi@@ al figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was locked two times because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
&quot; since he joined the Olympi@@ ast@@ eger of 2004 and Ex @-@ World Champion even faster than before , it is over 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered the greatest challenge of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ y@@ ce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) , had to sit in 2010 a six@@ teenth World Championship , after having been demonstrated by the intake of &quot; &quot; Oxy@@ co@@ don &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after surgery have had strong re@@ aches , it def@@ ended up the 29 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
Sandra Per@@ ko@@ vic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : 2011 became the Olympi@@ asi@@ eg@@ ress of 2012 , World Championship in 2013 and Europ@@ am@@ ended in 2010 to 2016 positive to the negoti@@ ated stimul@@ ant @-@ means meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine . &quot;
Per@@ ko@@ vic be@@ fought the wis@@ er intake and was locked in six months .
the four wid@@ est thro@@ ws this year go to the account of the great gold favorite i@@ tin .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Season / USA ) : the Peking @-@ Olympi@@ ast@@ eger and two @-@ major World Champion over 400 m , was successfully tested and 21 months has been closed . &quot;
a means of penis enlargement is responsible for penis enlargement .
this year is the 30 @-@ year @-@ old over 200 and 400 m far as the fast@@ est man in the world .
&quot; Ivan Tich@@ y ( Hammer@@ ing , Belarus ) : probably hardly any ath@@ letes have been det@@ ected as many med@@ als . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ on his WM title made by 2005 nine years later , after with him testosterone dop@@ ing was established . &quot;
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to give Olympia @-@ Silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and EM @-@ title 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
he also realized the Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ aille of the Olympic Games in 2008 he was given back to a part of the International Sport@@ court Court .
with 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he lies in the rank two of the world @-@ rank list . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world @-@ level and gold favorite i@@ tin was first tested in May however , but should still start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; at the 29 year old world champion@@ ships , hin@@ ts found hin@@ ts of an inher@@ ited dietary supplement , the sper@@ re of the world @-@ anti @-@ dop@@ ing Agency WA@@ DA fell mild and ran already on July 13 . &quot;
Bom@@ b@@ enter@@ tainer in Thailand - Austri@@ ans - Sever@@ al T@@ ote
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand emerg@@ ed with the woman in contact , said the spok@@ es@@ man of the Austrian Ministry , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Fri@@ day@@ morning . &quot;
&quot; I have been tar@@ ily suffered and been treated in the hospital , but I have already left them again . &quot;
your home trip has been planned for early September .
&quot; whether from further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ uk@@ et as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ ump@@ hon the Austrian citizen are also still un@@ clear . &quot;
the German Federal Ministry of Justice in this regard to permanent contact with local authorities , so Schn@@ ö@@ ll . &quot;
at some 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok nearby Hu@@ a H@@ in were first explo@@ ded at the Thurs@@ day@@ evening in an exter@@ mination of two bom@@ bs .
&quot; according to police have been killed a Thailand and about 20 people , including the Austrian , three Germans , three defe@@ ats and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Fri@@ day@@ early then again two jump@@ s went up again , according to the authorities another man was killed . &quot;
Ph@@ uk@@ et is also reported in the morning a bom@@ b explo@@ sion .
at the det@@ on@@ ation near the popular Ba@@ dest@@ ran@@ ds Pat@@ ong was transferred to Poli@@ cies .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the southeast coast of the country explo@@ ded then another bom@@ b that ten@@ se an urban attor@@ ney .
the spr@@ int shall be gone out according to the authorities in a flowers in front of the territory of the coast @-@ police in the air .
&quot; finally there are still det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast , as well as in Ch@@ ump@@ hon on the south @-@ east coast . &quot;
one go from a connection to the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , was called it . &quot;
&quot; the Bom@@ ben@@ ang@@ ates carry the same manuscript , &quot; said Ar@@ eg@@ ener@@ al Dan@@ i Krit@@ z@@ ee Fri@@ day@@ early in front of journalists . &quot;
we assume that it is a coordin@@ ated attacks .
&quot; it is too early to express itself for possible moti@@ ves - probably , it is likely to be the de@@ eds of Muslim reb@@ els . &quot;
Thai media wanted to ack@@ n@@ owledge a pattern that is typical for the bom@@ bing Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; the Thai police declared , the attacks cannot be in connection with the Islam@@ ist movement , or with international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local Sab@@ ot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spok@@ es@@ man in Bangkok . &quot;
one go out of it that the bom@@ bs were laid down by the opponents of the ruling army .
the authorities would have been reported in the past few days of mysterious hin@@ ts in the south of the country - however they have been not informed about the exact time and places of places .
&quot; still be un@@ clear , which group behind the sleeps . &quot;
&quot; police pointed its officials in the whole country , security around important government building as well as airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and am@@ us@@ ement area . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand there is still smaller bom@@ bing ra@@ inf@@ ants , but they are usually not against tourists . &quot;
&quot; in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace , which was used over years by Thailand &apos;s King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Adul@@ y@@ ade@@ j . &quot;
&quot; after the reason , bom@@ b explo@@ sions recomm@@ ends the Austrian foreign Federal Ministry on his homepage , the instructions of Thai security authorities . &quot;
&quot; high safety risk ( safety stage 3 ) succe@@ eded for the provinces Nar@@ ath@@ iw@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ gh@@ kl@@ a and its surroundings . &quot;
&quot; according to disp@@ utes between security , and Muslim population will not be retri@@ eved from the necessary travel to these provinces . &quot;
increased safety risk ( security stage 2 ) for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday led a few days after a contro@@ versi@@ al refer@@ endum on one of the military j@@ un@@ ta re@@ vised Constitution .
this sp@@ atial influence of the military influence even in the coming years .
&quot; Jun@@ ta @-@ Chef and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ cha said , the bom@@ bs are an attempt to stimul@@ ate chaos while the country towards stability , to improve the economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta , which had taken power according to a phase of blo@@ ody crimes , holds himself up for himself and to have led the kingdom to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , it is not succe@@ eded in the military to get the handle for years in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
there were already more than 6@@ 500 people in the conflict .
&quot; in front of a year ago , a year ago were killed in Bangkok in a p@@ ending of a popular Hind@@ u Sch@@ oth 20 people - most of them foreign tourists . &quot;
it was the blu@@ est of the young@@ est history of the country .
the right &quot; identi@@ fying movement &quot; is taken into the visor of the Federal Office of constitu@@ tional protection .
after several ob@@ sc@@ ales also the constitu@@ tional prot@@ ector also have made the group under observation .
&quot; we see on the &quot; identi@@ fying movement &quot; An@@ halt for asp@@ ir@@ ations against the un@@ affected democratic principle , &quot; said Con@@ stitu@@ tion@@ manager Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the Deutsche Presse @-@ agency in Berlin . &quot;
thus Zu@@ w@@ other Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diff@@ am@@ ated in extreme manner .
&quot; therefore , we observe the motion now . &quot;
&quot; identity movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it is directed against &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tiv@@ ary @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; and the &quot; loss of their own identity through foreign affairs . &quot;
&quot; constitu@@ tional researcher in nine federal states - Bremen , Bayern , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuringia - observe the &quot; identi@@ ties . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ id said , his authority was closely coordin@@ ated with the Landes@@ tern . &quot;
&quot; groups like the &quot; identi@@ fying movement &quot; try to pick up their target , where it stands , &quot; said the constitu@@ tional manager . &quot;
&quot; generally , extrem@@ ists , they are talking with youth@@ ful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event@@ ful Islam@@ ists as well as the legal enti@@ ties . &quot;
this is not a concrete advertising for your own matter .
the pro@@ paganda will be the people emotional .
young people are in a special way pr@@ one .
this is dangerous .
&quot; last , it has been given by several states reports on the contacts of &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; to Af@@ D @-@ politicians . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ d@@ ate said , he did not know findings . &quot;
for the constitu@@ tional protection possible contacts of this kind only from a certain point was relevant .
&quot; it comes to whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - in this case the Af@@ D - through certain people , the extrem@@ ist changes and so extreme becomes more extreme . &quot;
&quot; so , whether such people controls the influence on the party . &quot;
this is not recogni@@ z@@ able .
&quot; with a view to the clear increase in legal pun@@ ishment and att@@ acked on as@@ yl@@ um seek@@ ers and re@@ fuge@@ e places , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak in this context yet not by new right terrorism . &quot;
yet we have established in recent years that it can be illegal structures in the past years .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal group .
&quot; it can be quite that further legal supplements or small groups formed , the attacks against as@@ yl@@ um seek@@ ers , against re@@ fuge@@ e camps or attacks from other legal enti@@ ties . &quot;
but a long @-@ wide or europ@@ e@@ wide control of ru@@ ster@@ ism is not recogni@@ z@@ able but not recogni@@ z@@ able .
the previous groups have emerg@@ ed on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; they were worried about it , that many over@@ thro@@ es went to the account of people who were not appeared in the right scene in appearing before . &quot;
this is the concern .
many of the tattoo of attacks on as@@ yl@@ um places were not known as cri@@ minals , politically motiv@@ ated offen@@ ders or follow@@ ers of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; so many people have committed radi@@ ant who had previously agreed with legal rights , who were perhaps politically indi@@ fferent , or for example CD@@ U , SPD or Lin@@ ke who have been radic@@ alized by right@@ eous m@@ oods . &quot;

unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from the Aeg@@ ean Guinea @-@ Guinea when he had to stand alone in an in@@ let over 100 meters of Fre@@ estyle alone .

&quot; at the facility in Az@@ endorf , the deport@@ ation fee will be obtained later than once again , if appropriate improvement measures will be necessary . &quot;
after a vi@@ able lim@@ estone in Az@@ endorf is then lie at 4.@@ 37 euros per cu@@ bic meters .
&quot; as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( C@@ SU ) reported , was found in the permission of the budget by the district of Kul@@ mb@@ ach , that for these deport@@ ations under@@ covers . &quot;
the market Kas@@ endorf is oblig@@ ed to operate due to legal basis to operate the facilities .
&quot; from 1 October 2016 citizens as well as the commercial and industrial ge@@ arb@@ ox , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ ud , Lind@@ enberg , and Z@@ ult@@ enberg must be deeper into the wall@@ et . &quot;
feed@@ stocks are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as the Board of Directors of Herbert Schmidt to the Gre@@ ater , was a ren@@ unci@@ ation of the fees necessary for the water@@ proof@@ ing of the market . &quot;
in the period of October 2016 until September 2020 are also over @-@ - respectively sig@@ natur@@ es from the previous cal@@ cul@@ ation period .
the gra@@ dation feed@@ thre@@ ats agree with all three se@@ wage systems for relatively small institutions with a very low waste water fall between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 c@@ bi@@ km@@ eter per year .
&quot; thus , because of the low level of distribution for example in@@ expen@@ di@@ ture for the necessary repairs of several thousand Euros . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the se@@ wage works in all three installations is easily revers@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; continue to be in the back cal@@ ic@@ ular period of all three installations , not least because of its age of san@@ itation and repair@@ ing expen@@ di@@ ture on a considerable extent . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf was almost 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ers , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth and Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Lind@@ enberg and Lop@@ ud almost 20 years . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt , pointed out that in the Ab@@ wasser@@ plant Az@@ endorf the mechanical ventilation system due to a p@@ oll@@ uted . &quot;
&quot; in the pump@@ ing world pupp@@ y the nearly 20 years old convey@@ ing plants had to be over@@ hau@@ led and in the pond area of Lop@@ p , after nearly 20 years of operation of the first plum@@ bers , which ensures that water @-@ legal requirements can also be inser@@ ted in the future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; to these extraordinary performances , the continued expertise and maintenance cost , which are considered to be considered in the new calendar period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs which at the previous lim@@ ulation in the years 2011 / 2012 still significantly below the current level .
stone houses made clear that at the low di@@ arr@@ he@@ a in the three installations the expen@@ di@@ tures for the operation and maintenance &quot; fully penet@@ rated . &quot;
&quot; sei , the market @-@ profit of great entertainment costs have been spar@@ ed in the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the mentioned systems will remain pre@@ dominant in the duration of the long term , especially since you cannot expand the supply of the water @-@ purpose association Fries@@ enb@@ acht@@ al in order to do these systems in order to be de@@ fi@@ able facilities . &quot;

Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; -@@ Effect as Asian caric@@ ature
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is ani@@ me @-@ inspired but some ob@@ servers say that it is in@@ sensi@@ tively compared to bre@@ eds .
&quot; with its filter tool it allows Snap@@ chat about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties on such a way , which already borders the ab@@ sur@@ de . &quot;
&quot; you can transform themselves into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or figure , which might be out of a Roy Licht@@ enstein paintings . &quot;
the filters are essential and essential tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ ections every day .
all failure to get to the public .
Snap@@ chat @-@ filters have moved into the past in which they were acc@@ used to pro@@ pag@@ ate the App Black@@ face convey@@ or or white skin as beauty deal .
&quot; when this week he proposed a filter , who gave them s@@ lau@@ ght@@ ing , false teeth and penet@@ rated che@@ eks , there were some cri@@ tics for a rac@@ ist cartoon by Asi@@ aten - &quot; &quot; yellow@@ ish &quot; . &quot; &quot;
they asked whether this repeti@@ tive contro@@ vers@@ y refers to a bigger problem that the company has failed .
&quot; the news and em@@ bodi@@ ment were widespread on Wednesday , with reports by The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat that it would have been de@@ activated the feature . &quot;
the Company provided an exc@@ use : the filter was intended as hom@@ age to Ani@@ me characters and not as cartoon by Asi@@ aten .
yet out@@ si@@ ding that have experienced rac@@ ism the filters made by viol@@ ations of c@@ lich@@ és .
others have decided the Ani@@ me comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , grace as@@ thma , a Korean American art student , whose Twe@@ et has been widely spread over the photos that the filter was hur@@ ting and succe@@ eded un@@ pleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to ar@@ gu@@ ed with the counter@@ part of a very conflic@@ ting Asian caric@@ ature and the filter @-@ effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not succe@@ eded , but that the nest @-@ face was with@@ drawn away . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that cross these cultural pride .
&quot; the American culture seems to be wr@@ apped in a endless diversity and integration , from conference rooms up to Hollywood and the appliances , which we are all in hand . &quot;
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats great audience young people - who are in the matter of breed di@@ vers@@ er than their older counter@@ parts - could tend to expect to expect sen@@ sibility .
&quot; if one of snap@@ ch@@ ats fil@@ ing a picture creates that for a user is offen@@ sive , &quot; so it &apos;s much harder to remain un@@ noticed when it was earlier , &quot; &quot; said the 25 @-@ year K@@ atie Z@@ hu , in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as a product management and engine@@ ers for medium to delete her Snap@@ chat account and for others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in a set of medium and in a telephone interview , she said that rac@@ ist @-@ related contro@@ versi@@ es would reflect a lack of di@@ vers@@ ity at Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu cri@@ tici@@ zed the big part white , just male leaders and ended up their attachment with a has@@ ht@@ ag : # Del@@ ete@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either did you have any diverse representation of people with other skin colours , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that they work there , but not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable in order to say about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a compla@@ int , the Snap@@ chat is mostly uns@@ ri@@ fied . &quot;
the company has no figures on the diversity of its employees and points to its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday there is Snap@@ chat starting to discuss the cultural back@@ grounds of his staff , but according to a bal@@ loon , the company has recently concentrated a personal responsibility that focuses on the presence of the population groups and on internal integration process . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu said , that her Snap@@ chat account will be closed and added , &quot; I ask myself whether they need more users like us to say that this is not OK . &quot;
military Screening of ISIS &apos; intelligence @-@ servi@@ ce.de Committee on the Congress of Congress
&quot; Mil@@ itar@@ ism of the United States Central Command changed dram@@ atic information to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , when the actual states should be allowed on the ground in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the pro@@ visional Report , created by a Task Force of the republi@@ can members of the armed committ@@ ees , intelligence of great dis@@ satisfaction among the Central Command intelligence advis@@ es , reported how su@@ peri@@ ors reported their estimates on the American efforts in the struggle against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; the Central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military head@@ quar@@ tered in Tamp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American militar@@ ro@@ per@@ ations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; News information , presented by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com commands were regularly sent to a positive image of the American efforts against terrorism as there were the actual states on site and were accepted by more positive than analyses of other news services , &quot;
&quot; what happened at the Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer , when poor analyses of our political leaders , Ken Cal@@ ver@@ t , Republi@@ can member of the representative , firm . &quot;
the leaders in the Cent@@ Com range up to the top tip of the organization .
the ten @-@ si@@ ded report shows in detail high @-@ speed problems in the years of 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the formation of the Ira@@ qi armed forces .
&quot; although there is no direct reference to change that government &apos;s head has given to change the reports , demonstr@@ ates how analy@@ sts were exposed to the pressure of their pre@@ laws , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half years of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , opinions and statements before the congress is clearly more positive than it represents the facts . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com compliance is public@@ ly known that a military conqu@@ ering Mos@@ sul@@ s already started in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ sul , the second city of Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; by months of investig@@ ations , is so clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , republi@@ can Congress of the K@@ ans@@ as , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of the year 2015 , the tops of the Central Command follows the bibli@@ cal reports to download the danger through ISIS in Iraq . &quot;
the re@@ public@@ ans were called the Task Force into life after them was played that analy@@ sts were worried about the manip@@ ulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by detailed findings will be completed during the investig@@ ations .
additional investig@@ ations of Cent@@ Com reports are presented by the Secretary of the Def@@ ence of Def@@ ence in progress .
democratic members of the news committee published on Thursday their own findings on Thursday with some of the conclusions of the republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in the years of 2014 and 2015 the Cent@@ Com creates an over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of son@@ ic assessment , &quot; gave the most productive democr@@ at in the Committee , Member of the Repres@@ ent@@ atives of Adam B. Schiff , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; this process , so Mr. Schiff , &quot; del@@ ayed the release of bibli@@ cal accounts , &quot; ash@@ amed the mor@@ ality under analy@@ sts and &quot; has been over@@ ly little space for different opinions . &quot;
&quot; but Mr. boat and the democr@@ ats were given to have no advice on an intervention of the White House at Cent@@ Com Analy@@ sten in terms of &quot; certain political opinion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the pro@@ visional results of the congress of the Congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Beast &quot; .
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported by investig@@ ations by the general Insp@@ ector of the Pent@@ agon that were added to complaints from Cent@@ Com Analy@@ sten . &quot;
&quot; lt@@ r . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ cher of the Pent@@ agon , gave us a statement that the Ministry of Def@@ ence would have no reports of the congress , while the investig@@ ations of the general introduction would be still in the course . &quot;
&quot; but he also gave us that &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ting opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data , and that the news and defence must be a contro@@ versi@@ al discussion of this important topics of national defense . &quot;
&quot; the investig@@ ations have been beyond the question of successful air@@ kamp@@ agne under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion , which is now made by a growing number of members of the defence of the Ministry of Def@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; however , the alleg@@ ations of the past year however , President Obama has raised to the Central Command for honest estimate of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis . &quot;
&quot; the criticism regarding the en@@ closures of the Islamic State remember the Islamic state , as a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , a font about the recommendations of many analy@@ st only looked at the recommendations of many analy@@ sts in Iraq and little time to dev@@ ote themselves about the consequences of invasion of 2003 thoughts . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the insur@@ rection against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker to specify the Government of the Government against which had taken no significant impact on the financial situation of the Terr@@ org@@ os , since these pro@@ visional refin@@ eries had taken into operation since they had to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this knowledge was not published , the Times told in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ coms then Command command , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was reported by members of the Leg@@ is@@ lative because of its over@@ ly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing in front of the Senate . &quot;
general Austin went to retirement in April at the retirement and was replaced at Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the US win fourth match in the field of women , a show@@ down with great Britain before
&quot; one day after three gates had failed during a 6 @-@ 1 seal over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also had the first two gates for the American spra@@ ying team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americ@@ as with 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games should actually be a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said , they could not remember that have ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their gates in mind .
&quot; however , this knows it : the American competition for 4 @-@ 0 in the olymp@@ ic competition and are equal in their group with the British in the first place that after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
the United States and the United States will meet on Saturday during the last game of the first round .
&quot; both cre@@ ws have already qualified for the quarter @-@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which the two within its group from six teams from the first and second place will acquire . &quot;
the first @-@ up will take a little bit longer from the way that the other group will guide .
&quot; as ever the game may take out on Saturday , the American people saw a surprising vort@@ ex , four years after they have been land@@ ed over the last London Games on the last of 12 places . &quot;
B@@ am was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a Ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ schlä@@ ger in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became nation@@ alist of the USA , the young@@ est in the history of the team . &quot;
she missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 as it did not quali@@ fy for the cad@@ re .
then the year 2012 came in which for her and her team everything went wrong .
&quot; Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham became Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , a Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team and thus began to turn out things for better . &quot;
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical transition , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we do not have the employer in London we now have .
we have completely removed the ru@@ ding of the whole .
&quot; on Thursday Saturday , B@@ am opened the go@@ at in the first half of the game with a withdrawal from the range . &quot;
&quot; India was gone without a victory in the game , but the team showed themselves surpris@@ ingly and held the playing of 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , up to the game in their hands . &quot;
she carried a Sprint with the sh@@ allow ball over the left flan@@ k and then moved into the middle and lu@@ ded the ball into the door to get a 2 @-@ 0 leadership .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ zal@@ ez made the final door in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the door@@ ke@@ e@@ ers of the USA , Jackie Brig@@ gs , which had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
just like b@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on Saturday the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; amid the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline
wherever you are also like late it is , it is the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Jan@@ eiro seems to be ste@@ adily and in@@ escap@@ able , a fast rel@@ aun@@ ching between competition and stri@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; it is , as if the olymp@@ ic F@@ ack@@ el itself was a burning stress from the w@@ rist@@ bands to turn to the turn to the tur@@ ath@@ letes . &quot;
&quot; you can not stop the TV , read one newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighb@@ ours in the queue in the Coff@@ es@@ hop , without hear about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ aks or the disp@@ ute between Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there are Log@@ an D@@ ool@@ ey .
&quot; D@@ ool@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a Frauen@@ feld with di@@ mp@@ les , could certainly have been sent among these known names , which would be sent to Prime Time , which would be sent to Prime Time , if he would be a swimm@@ ers , turn , or even real . &quot;
&quot; D@@ ool@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fighting in the olymp@@ ic trampoline around gold . &quot;
the olymp@@ ic flame does not illumin@@ ated any event .
&quot; further from the center , partly in the shadow you find the sports , which are not generally accepted : bubble , arch@@ ery , badmin@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast swimming and may it be long .
&quot; but if I would like to make arguments for my certain dar@@ ling , then let me make the attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the trampoline already has been a Olympic event since 2000 it had been in Sydney when it had been in Sydney , it was last 16 years so fri@@ ght@@ ened , that many people had asked , did not know that it is at all a Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ art . &quot;
this could also be regional ignor@@ ance .
&quot; although the US ath@@ let@@ en was sent to competition , it has never won a med@@ al in the trampoline and had made up an ath@@ let@@ e until 2012 . &quot;
the Chinese and Russi@@ ans tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the can@@ adi@@ ans who share the women for women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold med@@ al from London this year .
&quot; the trampoline jump a certain outside , partly because it sounds un@@ solved O@@ hr pass@@ ender for a c@@ lown@@ fish as the for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; in this place I should ad@@ mit that I am not an expert , but only a little enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has humor@@ ous potential - the cart@@ ograp@@ hed trem@@ bling of his never to end up the elev@@ ating - but also the Grazie of power and diving , which combines two sports , which combines it essentially . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means as much as &quot; spring@@ board . &quot;
&quot; emerging winner jump on a gig@@ antic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , H@@ eous and S@@ alt@@ os ) before they end up at the feet . &quot;
&quot; they are evaluated according to the official Olympi@@ ap@@ ro@@ gram to execution , difficulty and &quot; &quot; flight times &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Secondary ath@@ letes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , are present in Rio compared . &quot;
the common olymp@@ ic v@@ ector is straight .
&quot; med@@ alli@@ sts have to go on in their pur@@ suit of gold , faster , up and dr@@ over , sometimes down to the destination , sometimes down and back , up and down on the playground . &quot;
&quot; they do not only enter the accordion or the starting point , but in the television there is another characteristic goal : the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ords . &quot;
&quot; the pur@@ pos@@ e@@ ful pur@@ suit is no@@ bel , ad@@ mir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even sti@@ r even an audience . &quot;
but it is also what I look at the spect@@ ator of these games as a bit ti@@ rel@@ ess .
this provides the trampoline a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a prec@@ eding movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she pr@@ all@@ t , se@@ em@@ ingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an ast@@ ron@@ aut , go up , then go down , then ef@@ fort@@ lessly back to the top . &quot;
&quot; there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no h@@ ec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves into the distance , only the dream , elegant up@@ lifting of time and gra@@ vity . &quot;

non @-@ viol@@ ent prot@@ ests in Ethiopia
&quot; demonstr@@ ators , the political changes in Ethiopia , respon@@ ding to viol@@ ent resistance of the government . &quot;
witnesses say that zig prot@@ esters were killed during the coll@@ isions with the police were killed in hard@@ ship .
is Ethiopia precisely here ?
&quot; in the last ten years it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid origin of the West with a fast growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but in the last few months prot@@ ests prot@@ ests against the government , and far more affected in more and more areas . &quot;
last week the thousands of people on the streets and long@@ ed fundamental political changes .
the response from the government was un@@ law@@ ful according to human rights organisations .
witnesses gave to that polic@@ emen respon@@ ded to zig in@@ armed prot@@ esters and killed .
&quot; in the re @-@ run videos about the prot@@ ests , the probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how to beat young people with stom@@ ach@@ s , while they were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall . &quot;
the b@@ oss of the UN @-@ authority for Human Rights now demands an in@@ coming investigation .
&quot; it was always difficult to maintain this country and in future it will be even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is after Nigeria the most complete country of Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopia , to fight terror@@ ists about the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa if ever , so much Western help . &quot;
Ethiopia and Economy exp@@ ire in a respect@@ able speed .
his infrastructure has dram@@ atically improved - there is a new counter@@ part in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ eba .
the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even if Ethiopia , everything else was an example for democracy - human rights organisations , all the repres@@ sion has led by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , with discretion effective to swe@@ at . &quot;
&quot; many were sent to ex@@ ile or in prison , killed or in the wilderness of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people supp@@ ress and these no other options have except to prot@@ ru@@ t it from , &quot; said Sey@@ ou@@ m Tes@@ home , a lec@@ turer in central Ethiopia . &quot;
the entire youth prot@@ ests .
a generation prot@@ ru@@ sted .
there are numerous complaints that all depend on the Bod@@ enn@@ ese up to the thro@@ ws in terms of power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; according to a wide range of last year the ruling party received the ruling party , and its allies the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time the ten@@ sions walk along the border to Erit@@ rea ; a battle for this c@@ ack@@ ery , contro@@ versi@@ al line called for hundreds of lives in June hundreds of life . &quot;
&quot; analy@@ st advoc@@ ates that separ@@ ati@@ sts as the Oro@@ mo @-@ liber@@ ation front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , who have more or less forced to armed the tur@@ bul@@ ences , and they could ref@@ rain . &quot;
to explain several factors why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of em@@ ank@@ le falls under the surface now explo@@ de .
the first seems harm@@ less : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years , many Ethiopia is able to communicate with the social media , since cheap smartphones have always been more common and improved the internet services . &quot;
&quot; even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter , what they are at regular inter@@ vals , especially with prot@@ ests , so many people can still talk about internet @-@ pro@@ x@@ ies you can hide . &quot;
several young Ethiopia said that they gathered themselves so to prot@@ ests .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ es in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; since the minist@@ ries , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia mostly Christian highlands , in politics and economy , while the Oro@@ mos had been pron@@ ounc@@ ed , of which many Muslims are living and in flat areas . &quot;
but even this is changing just .
&quot; we are dedicated to co @-@ ordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Ch@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest prot@@ ests were held in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which are roughly 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military , in trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former Reb@@ al leader , was up to his death on a non @-@ publi@@ k pro@@ claimed disease in 2012 17 years in Ethiopia . &quot;
&quot; he was regarded as tac@@ tical geni@@ us , a man who could think about cor@@ ners . &quot;
&quot; analy@@ sts say that he was particularly versi@@ fied in it , early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and special comm@@ issions to use opponents and make them un@@ harmful . &quot;
&quot; the current regime is missing in this fundamental , &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict @-@ analysis . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia , new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected from relatively un@@ reliable reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; different from Mr Mel@@ es , who came out of the Tig@@ ray Region Nord@@ ae@@ op@@ i@@ ens , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south . &quot;
analy@@ st say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the Tig@@ ray controlled security services .
many fear@@ ed that the result is more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time that Ethiopia was made such a rebel@@ lion in 2005 , after thousands against elections prot@@ ested , which was se@@ aled from the government and then st@@ olen by the government . &quot;
&quot; during the following swe@@ eps , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if it was less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; Development experts , pra@@ ised Ethiopia , as well as the new counter@@ part , as well as the new pen@@ alty track , as well as for their meas@@ urable adv@@ ances in ar@@ gu@@ ess . &quot;
but obviously this does not have the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ er@@ able of the Ethi@@ op@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous eth@@ ical form .
&quot; last month , prot@@ ested in G@@ ond@@ ar , a am@@ har@@ ic city , from Tig@@ ray guided shops and the h@@ ate towards the Tig@@ ray in the social media . &quot;
analy@@ st say that the prot@@ ests will bring the US and other Western allies into a pec@@ uli@@ ar position .
&quot; the American administration used to Ethiopia as a basis for d@@ ron@@ g@@ ations about the neighbor@@ ing Somalia , even if they recently said this base has closed . &quot;
&quot; while the West does not want to support democracy , he does not want his allies in a already vol@@ ati@@ le area . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; is a very thin cru@@ ise . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp explains his asser@@ tion Obama founded ISIS &apos; sar@@ cas@@ m
&quot; Donald J. Tru@@ mp , tried on Friday the last contro@@ vers@@ y which sur@@ rounds the campaign by making his several repe@@ at@@ edly asser@@ tion , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the Terr@@ org@@ group Islam@@ ist State , not seriously . &quot;
this clari@@ fying presents new questions about the communic@@ ative skills of the Pres@@ idency of the Republi@@ can whether it is able to communicate clearly and understand@@ able with the American public .
&quot; it also brings his collabor@@ ations which stri@@ ve to take him during an event@@ ful stage in protection , in the ex@@ emp@@ tive position , statements to declare that he could not have not meant . &quot;
&quot; after having made the clear@@ ance at a elect@@ oral event at the end of the Wedn@@ es@@ days and insi@@ sted his Tru@@ mp in relation to the asser@@ tion on Thursday and continu@@ ance in interviews that he really does not intended to indicate , the President and Mrs. Clinton had made ISIS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early stay , Mr. Tru@@ mp , he was simply s@@ ark@@ as@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; the Twe@@ et was the opposite to the previous day , where Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a series of interviews , he meant the alleg@@ ations completely serious . &quot;
&quot; as the conserv@@ ative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hug@@ h He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tru@@ mp wanted to we@@ aken the statement something by he rem@@ ind@@ ed him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy him , the republi@@ can pres@@ idency wanted to know anything of it . &quot;
&quot; the last storm of criticism pr@@ as@@ sel@@ t on Mr. Tru@@ mp , while he attempts to bear the focus of his campaign due to falling re@@ juven@@ ation values on the economic situation . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton gave Re@@ den to the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp would like to return to this topic .
&quot; beyond Twitter , he sent that Mrs. Clin@@ tons proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech gets boring . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already given sar@@ cas@@ m to its defense .
&quot; in late July he moved strong criticism to himself , when he said , Mrs. Clin@@ ton E@@ mails h@@ ack , but he later declared &quot; Nat@@ as@@ tically , I said the sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to move the lingu@@ istic limits in politics and then go back to ro@@ wing .
&quot; I think it is one of its methods to test , how certain messages can be taken from his fans like they arrive , and then if necessary &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communications del@@ us@@ dar@@ e , who observed the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements about his statements , so that they can be interpre@@ ted in different ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of the sound for the pres@@ idential elections , Mr. Tru@@ mp has adopted a valu@@ ed sound , since its conver@@ sions have gone further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a tour with a great adv@@ ancement in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ an @-@ head @-@ race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tru@@ mp generally tried to exc@@ use his cri@@ tics , he def@@ ends his cri@@ tics frequently , his statements or hum@@ our wrong to understand . &quot;
&quot; but while he is strengthening the attention of attention in recent months of his pres@@ idential election , Mr. Tru@@ mps sh@@ unt have brought his loy@@ al collabor@@ ators to him , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ant his statements may be . &quot;
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mps most prominent inter@@ ventions , gave great effort to defend the candidates today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legi@@ timate , political comments &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani so he said to the accuracy of Mr. Tru@@ mp &apos;s declar@@ ations whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that Obama was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them hind@@ legs , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he moved the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most ma@@ instre@@ am @-@ Republi@@ can try to ar@@ gu@@ ess that the government under Obama , served as foreign minist@@ ers to spread it in ISIS to spread the situation in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; before the v@@ oting events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp put his attacks on the media and bow@@ ed them to be taken upon each of his words and to be taken upon him . &quot;
&quot; he desp@@ ised the &quot; poor , j@@ ut@@ ori@@ ous &quot; TV experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; You can not . &quot;
&quot; some of the democr@@ ats spot@@ ted via Mr. Tru@@ mps sorry , than just another proof that he is un@@ suitable for the pres@@ idential office . &quot;
once on the price from the market is shown café in Green@@ point comes back
&quot; ver@@ b Cafe was a ash@@ amed café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could pay only a Wi @-@ Fi , but 15 years with good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices of his Bed@@ ford Avenue Brooklyn was displac@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the shop So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , the ver@@ b in summer 2014 replaced , sold soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot;
indigen@@ ous people under@@ stands it as the final loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fied city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ sent wrote on Twitter , &quot; &quot; I know , New York is change , but I still cannot believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel apart and now is a soap shop . &quot;
&quot; but when New York change is , it is also re @-@ in@@ vention . &quot;
a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point in less than a m@@ ile north of its original location .
&quot; the new ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but has still some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rod@@ rigu@@ ez , a long @-@ year employees of old cafés , the owner and managing director of the new café . &quot;
he started working in 2001 at Ver@@ b and stayed there until the end .
&quot; when he offered a customer to provide money for a new outside , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rod@@ rigu@@ ez , 36 , re@@ tained much . &quot;
le@@ b uses the same distribut@@ or for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ som@@ eb@@ in@@ ist model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old b .
but Rod@@ rigu@@ ez said that he wanted to experi@@ ment .
he led new ingredients .
on the menu are sand@@ wich@@ es with b@@ acon and cheese and there are gar@@ ni@@ ers such as cap@@ ers and sau@@ ated onions .
there are natural dis@@ ks .
&quot; the café serves no beer more , there is fresh ju@@ ices . &quot;
after nine months Rod@@ rigu@@ ez said Rod@@ rigu@@ ez that he noticed an increased electricity on old regul@@ ators .
&quot; many old customers were also shown by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the Ver@@ b regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way up . &quot;
&quot; after having closed the b , she gave a while the coffee ham , she said . &quot;
&quot; I was clear that it was at the coffee and in the culture in the promise that came to me , &quot; &quot; said her . &quot;
&quot; now , drink it again coffee , even if they placed on this day instead of their usual I@@ ced coff@@ ees a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea , which is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a further long @-@ term and loy@@ al customer since the beginning of the se@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before the work and set up continuously the same .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss calcul@@ ator and they prepare my Every@@ thing bag@@ el with butter , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Rod@@ rigu@@ ez said , he wanted to experi@@ ment experim@@ enting and add new ingredients to the menu . &quot;
&quot; nowadays Ros@@ enthal does not get his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing dre@@ w with b@@ acon , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rod@@ rigu@@ ez said that he was not Gro@@ ll about that the soap shop has taken the old business .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie will make a special soap for ornam@@ ents with the cold coffee of coffee bars as ad@@ vices . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go on her offer , &quot; &quot; said Rod@@ rigu@@ ez . &quot;
and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu into the Polish and Rod@@ rigu@@ ez , that he has to present them soon , so that his new neighb@@ ours welcome . &quot;
the site also has other advantages .
a cho@@ p tot@@ t@@ locally wants to fill the cold coffee into the bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the café on a dis@@ b@@ bed building exp@@ ands .
for many customers a new ver@@ b is sufficient to get their old favorites .
&quot; Joseph W@@ itt was tri@@ bal , and said that he was destroyed at the ground , when the café closed . &quot;
&quot; when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the appearance of the locom@@ otive , and the taxation has felt a new coffee , like a home@@ coming . &quot;
&quot; I had to cra@@ w@@ ed this , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the depres@@ sing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his climb to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
as Fein@@ schm@@ ecker President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt had a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined delicacies of Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland Water@@ tor@@ tie soup .
his menu on this day was a bit mod@@ est : stuff@@ ed egg in Tom@@ at@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , pot@@ atoes and dess@@ ert a pl@@ au@@ d@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Bri@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ E added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans , as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both gro@@ histori@@ ans .
&quot; co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; acted from Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Zi@@ egel@@ man told in her book &quot; 97 Orchard &quot; about living in a residential building at the Lower East Side of the food &apos;s perspective . &quot;
&quot; your first collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , which will appear on Tuesday at the Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity , when they meet with a repor@@ ter in Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , schn@@ ud@@ ov@@ os@@ em snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has already been in business since the market . &quot;
&quot; brick , 54 , ordered a fresh che@@ eses with olive oil , while Co@@ E , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with pot@@ atoes and veget@@ able . &quot;
&quot; as the repor@@ ter Hack@@ br@@ aten , this took place for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich food was very popular , &quot; &quot; said Bri@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; called Erd@@ n@@ uss@@ bread , Leb@@ a , and sav@@ er bread . &quot;
they were prepared from a ingredi@@ ent and a bit of Bil@@ lig@@ ently that stret@@ ches the ingredi@@ ent .

their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960@@ s as a nuclear weapon to get bigger quantities of this radio@@ active carbon off@@ s into the atmosphere .
&quot; in which with 220 cen@@ timet@@ ers length of the third animal , the left @-@ part contained a small amount of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapon @-@ up , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday during his investigation in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; all major Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie had a normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts , which arises from cosmic rays in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ watch for an 493 cen@@ timet@@ ers for a 493 cen@@ timet@@ ers at the age of 335 years , during the record @-@ H@@ ai with 502 cen@@ timet@@ ers even 392 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Greenland females only then get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
now the researchers were able to arrange the length an age .
&quot; since one of the animals with 392 cen@@ timet@@ ers probably stood at the th@@ res@@ hold of lovemaking and his age with 156 years , Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie with the multip@@ lication obviously at least one and a half centuries of time . &quot;
also this is likely to be cat@@ ch@@ ord in the world too .
that such meth@@ yl@@ al@@ eme live mainly in hum@@ ble waters is no co@@ incidence .
&quot; the previous record holder , a 211 Years old Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ wal , in whose b@@ acon at the neck a 120 years old Har@@ pun@@ en@@ spitze , was caught in front of Alaska . &quot;
due to low temperatures often also the organism of the living there are living on as@@ par@@ flame .
it is therefore later - and age @-@ slow .
&quot; to keep in cold water warm to the cold water , the animals are often especially great . &quot;
&quot; because the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal heat . &quot;
the heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much greater than with a grams of elephant .
a further advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; an pett@@ y animal lives so dangerous and should concentrate on that as possible as many offspring , &quot; explained the evolution of evolution . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a very big animal should rather invest his resources in a long life . &quot;

Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; the city on the Main has completed the best opportunities in competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg the best opportunities to attr@@ act new jobs and companies . &quot;
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt also benef@@ ited from the Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Competence &apos;s financial markets and housing markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it refer@@ endum , it is un@@ certain if money continued from London from finance to operate throughout the EU . &quot;
for the so called EU @-@ Pass you have so far enough to apply to the UK approval .
this is just using big US banks .
several banks have already announced jobs to shift .
&quot; the Lob@@ by@@ unification &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; is calculated with 10000 new jobs on the Main Page 5 years .
&quot; for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( EC@@ B ) , united responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance company EI@@ OP@@ A and the risk of the ES@@ RB . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) is head@@ quar@@ tered , but this is less significant for the financial industry than the EC@@ B . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the emer@@ gency is important for banks , as they can communicate so directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; Luxembourg has a great Fond@@ s@@ branche , as well as Dublin at the infrastructure worse . &quot;
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the great airport .
&quot; furthermore , the city is also available with easy available premises . &quot;
&quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
on the Seine River also the rental for first class of business sessions about 50 percent higher than on the Main .
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt offer a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ran@@ king of the Consult@@ ancy Mer@@ cer reads the city to place 7 , Luxembourg on place 19 , Dublin on No. 33 and Paris on 37@@ th place . &quot;
&quot; even if quality of life is a question of pre@@ ference , &quot; &quot; with his already strong position as a financial location for the European Single Market , Frankfurt further banks and investors &quot; &quot; followed the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; but London will remain in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um most important financial center in Europe , my economic for@@ gers . &quot;
&quot; for this , the power relations : London worked in London in accordance with the numbers of the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba at the end of 2015 around 14@@ 4000 people in the ban@@ enb@@ ran@@ che , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2500 . &quot;

&quot; Jewish director , Berlin hotel , because Israeli election was removed after &quot; &quot; Arabic &quot; &quot; - RT News &quot;
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots un@@ attended a media thought , after he had concluded that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not listed Israeli proposals since it would have been elected as arab@@ ic guests according to a staff &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Claude Lan@@ z@@ mann , author of the Holocaust &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; sent his anger in Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by sending an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
during his last stay Lan@@ z@@ mann was tried to find Israel on the site list of the hotel .
&quot; however , the country was not listed between the countries , which can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; what happened in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , is possible that Israel has been elimin@@ ated and deleted ? &quot;
written Lan@@ z@@ mann .
instead the Kemp@@ inks@@ i Bristol is a way to choose Israel about their own call center .
after an explanation the director turned to the hotel recep@@ tion .
&quot; the answer that he got there , &quot; shock@@ ed him , &quot; as Lan@@ z@@ mann wrote . &quot;
&quot; the hotel , said that the measure is a &quot; deli@@ ber@@ ate decision of the management of Kemp@@ inski Hotels &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the reason , which stood behind , dis@@ solve in the director even more anger . &quot;
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they demands that the election is deleted , the cler@@ k was removed from Lan@@ z@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli Ambassador of Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov H@@ adas @-@ trading , this called a &quot; &quot; great shame &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were exhau@@ sted from this event and trou@@ bled .
this is really very embarrass@@ ing .
&quot; the fact that this has borne this in Germany in exactly this hotel chain , is even a bigger shame . &quot;
this requires no explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; the right conclusions draws , &quot; &quot; said the minist@@ ers . &quot;
the inci@@ dent resolve a fairly large reson@@ ance on the internet in which the people were sc@@ andal .
&quot; some oppressed the Kemp@@ inski Hotel , that it would have been abandoned to the &quot; &quot; arti@@ ficial &quot; &quot; in Arabic guests &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; ash@@ amed you , &quot; was called it in another article in which it was pointed out that the hotel that is located at the cl@@ assy Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a synagog@@ ue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel proved quickly all alleg@@ ations of himself and called the inci@@ dent of &quot; &quot; seeing &quot; &quot; and &quot; ap@@ olog@@ ised &quot; &quot; at Lan@@ z@@ mann , reports The mirror . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct instruction , &quot; Israel not to record into the quick @-@ list &quot; , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung has a spok@@ es@@ man of Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;

trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % on - RT Business
&quot; with the ab@@ olition of sanctions , according to the Russian Ambassador of Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ary@@ an , the trading segment between Moscow and T@@ ehr@@ an in the annual comparison of 7@@ 0,@@ 9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions were raised against Iran , the interest of the Russian company grew up in shops in the country , the amb@@ assador of the Ambassador . &quot;
Russian companies take existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to get access to the market .
&quot; of course , the further trade @-@ building is one of the largest priorities of bilater@@ al cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ary@@ an . &quot;
he noted that the trade union between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 by 7@@ 0.4 per cent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million was signed .
&quot; in particular , Russian imp@@ orts in Iran around 9@@ 1.5 percent is ste@@ ad@@ ful and pra@@ ised $ 697 million . &quot;
Russian imp@@ orts from Iran rose 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade @-@ up@@ swing was reached by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; said the Ambassador . &quot;
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ary@@ k goes for this year from a record number of Iran@@ ian tourists in Russia .
&quot; last year the Russian elections gave to some 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily of passport , an Iran@@ ian citizens . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries that concerns the economy in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record will be Iran@@ ian tourists in Russia from the last year , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , relatively few Russi@@ ans visit Iran , something from which the amb@@ assador hopes that it will change . &quot;
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ fa@@ han , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , the mon@@ um@@ ente of ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;

he moved this statement later and there was no obj@@ ection of England Rival .
with such a phenomen@@ al victory this time was no such problem .
&quot; said , &quot; &quot; It feels with all the GB flags on the Tri@@ bun@@ es like London . &quot;
we have joined the team in the last three months .
&quot; we have come so bad for so many world titles , that it was amazing to win back at the Olympi@@ ad again . &quot;
&quot; this is an event , a gold med@@ al for the nation , the seven of 10 titles were obtained both in Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if it is a bar@@ ometer for our progress in the last five months , that we expect a successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom . &quot;
with the form of Kenn@@ y it is in the realm of possible that he was repeated &apos;s victory of three olymp@@ ic Gold@@ med@@ als in a competition .
&quot; this was born for Kenn@@ y - which was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , which was also born on 23 March ( a apparently no date for British sports ; on the day , Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster was born ) - a y@@ iel@@ ds of six Gold@@ med@@ als and a silver med@@ al . &quot;
the leu@@ ka@@ emia of Ho@@ y is the same .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the Sprint who starts today and go over three days .
&quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; I enjoy it just for the moment . &quot;
the team @-@ Event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels something lon@@ ely to win alone .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; if he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should come for the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only med@@ alli@@ sts of the day , but there were other good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Brad@@ ly Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fast@@ est performance in the Vi@@ erer @-@ Vi@@ er kilometers . &quot;
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 38,@@ 42 on the destination .
&quot; the World@@ h@@ ord that was won in London Gold , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,6@@ 59 . &quot;
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held on the second day of the competition at the Wig@@ gins with security in the focus .
&quot; he had advanced yesterday with representative before the qualification , when it was stret@@ ched to him , in order to measure its height . &quot;
&quot; in appropriate women &apos;s competition , the morning continues and ended , av@@ anci@@ ed Laura Tr@@ ott , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ pelago in Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord@@ s@@ Time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB Team leaves itself to be on his strong railway team to dom@@ ate the average period of the Olympic Games and bring a sh@@ ar to med@@ als .
after a truly exceptional representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London have gone the expectations for Rio rund@@ own .
&quot; it played drama in the background , so the return of the technical hur@@ ters Shane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the middle of Sex@@ ist and Mob@@ b@@ ing@@ vor@@ es as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ leton . &quot;
&quot; however , when one sees the first evening of the competition at Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite afterwards , then the legend@@ ary reputation GB@@ s who has reached the perfect moment his cli@@ max again . &quot;
future of mel@@ ting from Port@@ land due to the increase of energy consumption
&quot; the future of the aluminium mel@@ ting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - are standing on the game , since the system operator termin@@ ate the Energi@@ el@@ ate Agreement , and thus all terms of delivery will be disp@@ uted , such as the provision of energy companies . &quot;
&quot; this step followed by the decision of the government in Victoria beginning of this year , no further sub@@ si@@ dies to operation of the plant . &quot;
one for 20 years fixed Sub@@ vention takes place in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the complex of Alco@@ a in Port@@ land are standing on the game .
not less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indi@@ rect - could be at risk associated with a closure .
&quot; in addition , it could come to Dom@@ ino@@ effects since the mel@@ ting of approximately 10 per cent of the whole power production of Vic@@ tori@@ as . &quot;
in 2014 Alco@@ ve the Point Henry Schmel@@ zer@@ ei that led last year to a closing of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station .
the mel@@ ting of Alco@@ a in Port@@ land loses money and risk .
&quot; this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation as regards the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian Dollars and last due to the stra@@ ints for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the big aluminium mel@@ ting with his Lo@@ y Yang A Kraft@@ werk in Lat@@ robe Valley , distributed with that three other owners will announce their tre@@ ati@@ es . &quot;
the complex is located in the middle of a joint venture of Alco@@ a and Alum@@ ina which hold the Chinese company CI@@ TIC and the Japanese Mar@@ u@@ ben@@ i Cor@@ p smaller portions .
&quot; AG@@ L will assume that the plant in Port@@ land continues to be operated in Port@@ land , which means a further physical demand for electricity through the melt flow . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L said , &quot; &quot; AG@@ L said that the Tre@@ ati@@ es are called &quot; &quot; Sich@@ uan &quot; &quot; which should come into force from November 2016 . &quot;
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month la@@ under@@ ing after they will end the 2017 .
&quot; it is therefore AG@@ L that the contracts will contribute to the income in the financial year 17 to the revenue , &quot; said the power supply . &quot;
all potential impact on revenues on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forec@@ asts of strong termin@@ ology for large @-@ commercial production .
AG@@ L shared with that the value of contracts already written in his annual statement in the amount of $ 187 million in &quot; expect@@ ation of an Canc@@ ellation . &quot;
&quot; Alco@@ ve said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; ability Alco@@ ve ... the melt away or the power supply to the melt away &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the US company said that there was a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who should have entered into force from November this year , even if there is still an explanation because it has returned from the contract . &quot;
analy@@ st war@@ n due to the poor economic conditions of the industry before the potential closure of the Port@@ land mel@@ ting in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near New@@ castle .
&quot; in reference to the statements of the Analy@@ zer at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen , that Port@@ land took over 600 meg@@ a@@ watts and Tom@@ ago around 900 meg@@ a@@ watts . &quot;
&quot; should both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; stra@@ w centre &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a gener@@ ating set would not be good , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; more than just a card@@ as@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the new issue of the Vog@@ ue &quot;
&quot; tweet , 20 , Model , and fourth daughter of the managers and mother of the Card@@ as@@ hi@@ an @-@ jen@@ ner C@@ lan@@ s Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted new issue of the U.S. tom@@ ue . &quot;
&quot; once , the mark of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der is and on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ agram account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people who love , I brought me the sight of this Co@@ vers to we@@ ep , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot;
&quot; the revelation of the Co@@ vers followed by a bizar@@ re ( or simply support Up with the Card@@ as@@ hi@@ ans @-@ On@@ k@@ els and producers of Keeping Up Ry@@ an Se@@ ac@@ rest ) as well as in the presence of the all@@ s@@ eits most popular show@@ biz On@@ k@@ els and producers of Keeping Up Ry@@ an Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as well as in presence of the all@@ s@@ eits most popular show@@ biz On@@ k@@ els and producers by keeping up Ry@@ an Se@@ ac@@ rest , and that ends with a classic turn : they all have a surprise party . &quot;
&quot; this represents the cl@@ assy plot nearly every birthday of a nur@@ ser@@ y ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You d@@ acht@@ est that we had to forget you ? &quot; , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a station at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to take part in this Publi@@ city . &quot;
with a view of the new issue of the Vog@@ ue , certainly has started a new era of Card@@ as@@ hi@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ om &apos;s great sister Kim likes it , which saw the Vog@@ ue cover , be@@ aten ( she and her husband Kan@@ ye West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the new issue of the magazine is a le@@ ague for itself . &quot;
the new issue is the most popular edition of the year .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference , the rather a sculp@@ tor looks like a mo@@ de@@ journal , the output draws a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were from the 832 pages of rolling 615 pages advertising ) . &quot;
the un@@ veil@@ ing of his Cover@@ stars is expected so long@@ ad@@ dic@@ tive that in the last two years of images of the magazine is still ahead of the official announcement .
&quot; women who were already on the cover , Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate M@@ oss . &quot;
&quot; in recent years were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ rities &quot; as &quot; Models , the celeb@@ rities &quot; on the cover . &quot;
Oscar @-@ Award @-@ winner and Di@@ or @-@ mark@@ en@@ bot@@ schaf@@ ter@@ ator Jennifer Lawrence was 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor . &quot;
&quot; but even at the low chance that woman jen@@ ner - that is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; break@@ through model &quot; &quot; of its generation - among the earlier category falls , it is in good company . &quot;
these celeb@@ rities are not related to famous individuals or Reality Stars or teen@@ agers from nowadays who know how to get a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if it &apos;s all on the one &apos;s true ) .
they are truly talented women who will sign in the entertainment industry .
Bey@@ once appeared on the last Cover with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career .
naturally Jenn@@ ers do not like Jenn@@ ers are not every .
with her Reality @-@ TV story was Jenn@@ ers position in the Mo@@ de@@ world always a bit ten@@ se .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Modell Stephan@@ ie Sey@@ m@@ our jen@@ ner and her colle@@ ague Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and named them &quot; the mist@@ ress of the eyel@@ id . &quot;
these feelings aw@@ ake again high when the message with the show Jenn@@ ers came out on the Vog@@ ue Cover .
&quot; but on the mission@@ ary , it seems to go to the point . &quot;
the AL@@ jen@@ ner is on the cover of the new edition of the Vog@@ ue .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of the word a super@@ model .
it runs for Marc Jaco@@ bs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all of her sisters sell some pictures of their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she sold her homemade pictures of C@@ indy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in their spare time she is on the Reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
commun@@ al centers provide every year 160@@ .000 people starting
&quot; more than 160@@ .000 of the benef@@ ici@@ aries of the country are transferred from the community centers , while the industry is transferred to the effects of further short@@ cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; already three of five persons - mostly older people , imm@@ ig@@ rants , imm@@ ig@@ rants , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just Del@@ og@@ rams and similar ones - for free legal advice and legal conditions . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already covered , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; from June next year , this juris@@ dic@@ tions will lose further 30 percent of their states . &quot;
the director of the community centres of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ r@@ ell said that the last survey of the National Association of municip@@ al centers suggests that already thousands of people each year .
Far@@ r@@ ell said that the situation without an ab@@ olition of the decisions of the federal government would only be worse .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ lands common centers are chron@@ ically controlled , what means that thousands of people of important services you need to be rej@@ ected , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave viol@@ ent relationships , people with uns@@ ett@@ able and depres@@ sing deb@@ ts , families , which were caused by separ@@ ating workers , workers who have un@@ affected problems - all these people have problems of legal nature and this collection that they may not have the help you need . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government is from June 2017 the funds for 30 percent shorter , which means to be forced to be forced by help people from Que@@ ens@@ land , with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we call for the gener@@ osity and Federal Minister of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis , so that the people will immediately lift up the assistance that they need to obtain in legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the federal government filled their commitment to up@@ lifting funds for jurisdiction on the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now at the time to view the needs of the common centres and its clients , as well as that the government is Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k in this important work . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp &apos;s campaign was charged after employee cultiv@@ ated weapon
&quot; new York : Donald Tru@@ mps campaign was charged due to all@@ eged inj@@ ustice , after you were told that their campaign leader for North Carolina was directed to an employee when she was born in February at a jeep . &quot;
&quot; the inci@@ dent is described in an indic@@ t@@ ment , which was submitted on Wednesday in the Landes@@ gericht by Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ord@@ ini , a former software program for the campaign in this state . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ord@@ ini gave to be wa@@ ited to have wa@@ ited for the matter intern@@ ally , before it realized that &quot; it would not happen . &quot;
&quot; the campaign leader , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; moved a pist@@ ol , put his right po@@ cket on the de@@ eds , and red@@ ded the run in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; gave B@@ ord@@ ini in his ac@@ cus@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; after having respon@@ ded to local and regional campaigns , B@@ ord@@ ini introduced that at least four people had made the same experience with Philli@@ p , he gave up in the indic@@ t@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be de@@ activated to set damage to damage , &quot; gave B@@ ord@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; the indic@@ t@@ ment occurs only two days after the Republi@@ can pres@@ idency of a rebel@@ lion , when he had to take a man @-@ force in North Carolina , that the &quot; Second Am@@ end@@ ment people &quot; - should take action if his Ri@@ val@@ in Hill@@ ary Clinton should be elected and judge . &quot;
Tru@@ mp &apos;s campaign was clear that the media would have given his words from the context and that he would not exhau@@ sted to violence .
&quot; or@@ da@@ is , a damages is demand@@ ed by the campaign for the violation of the &quot; &quot; violation of &quot; &quot; and of Philip because of the in@@ fr@@ ing@@ ement and ab@@ norm@@ ative damage . &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey on countries @-@ elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) will be significant losses for government parties and CD@@ U .
&quot; this gave a representative firm of the announcement of the IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; Image &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot;
&quot; while the red @-@ black governmental co@@ alition in the north could continue to regi@@ men , this is not possible after conver@@ sions in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both states , the SPD would have been the stron@@ gest party , and therefore could have good chances to ask the government . &quot;
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern investig@@ ated the SPD of 35,@@ 6 percent for five years ago on 24 percent .
the party trou@@ bled due to the survey conducted only just before the CD@@ U that could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is contro@@ versi@@ al between the left and the after@@ no@@ .
&quot; the lens rose to 19 percent ( before 18,@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented with 19 per cent for the first time in the land@@ day . &quot;
&quot; despite light losses , despite light losses with 6 percent ( previously 8,@@ 7 percent ) again in the heavy @-@ day land@@ day . &quot;
np@@ d and F@@ DP would not be represented at 3 per cent in the app@@ day .
the SPD member of the survey was only 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U achieved only 18 percent by 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; they are still behind the green with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17,@@ 6 percent ) , but in front of the left with 15 per cent ( previously 11,@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the members of the Chamber of parliament@@ arians .
&quot; with 5 percent the F@@ DP could hope to return on a return , the pir@@ ates would miss against it in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Commun@@ ic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ mail and internet in time : 20 years ago the Nokia Commun@@ ic@@ ator came to the market .
the success@@ ors now coordin@@ ate the world - its manufacturers had a disaster .
the unit w@@ og almost a half kil@@ og@@ rams and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was thick@@ er and bigger , it was therefore not good in hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was quite kno@@ ck . &quot;
the built @-@ in memory was initially eight meg@@ abyte in the initially eight meg@@ abyte that would submit a high resolution today .
an iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gig@@ abyte .
&quot; Nokia 9000 Commun@@ ic@@ ator came just 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , into the business - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a couple of euros , lovers can still buy the devices on the internet , but they are somehow from the St@@ one@@ age of the Internet . &quot;
but 20 years ago the Commun@@ ic@@ ator was a sens@@ ation .
the Finnish mobile phone maker had previously announced the product a few months before at the Computer@@ messe CeBIT in Hannover as &quot; Office in the West@@ ental format . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax was the Commun@@ ic@@ ator . &quot;
even access to web pages was possible by HTML browsers if too slow .
a calcul@@ ator was available to a digital ad@@ ress@@ buch and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be similar to a lap@@ top .
then a small keyboard and a Black @-@ White @-@ screen .
&quot; very proud was the price : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , so about 1400 euros . &quot;
the average retail price of a smartphones in Germany was over 392 euros .
nobody was able to disp@@ ose in August 1996 that the Commun@@ ic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
&quot; tel@@ eph@@ ones are a success story , though not for Nokia . &quot;
the mobile @-@ card of the Fin@@ ns lived an un@@ prec@@ ed@@ less disaster has eventually been sold to Microsoft and operated .
&quot; today , the market today domin@@ ates suppliers , all of the much later came as Nokia . &quot;
&quot; always and everywhere be online , this is today for a lot of people everyday life . &quot;
2015 there was almost two billion smartphone users worldwide .
sold for about 1.4 billion devices based on Samsung and Apple sets out of it alone 555 million units .
worldwide turnover with the equipment is about 400 billion euros .
&quot; to do this , the well running shops of the t@@ oll@@ uted app @-@ suppliers and telecommunications companies . &quot;
around the smartphone in the meantime the whole industry was created .
the decisive break@@ through to mass market arrived at the beginning of 2007 when announced Apple @-@ Chef Steve Jobs on the Mac @-@ World introduction of the iPh@@ ones at the beginning of 2007 .
&quot; he spoke three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communication , everything via touch screen easy to use . &quot;
&quot; the tri@@ umph of Apple began , even today the iPhone is the most important product of the group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , the market domin@@ ates the market had seen . &quot;
they dis@@ appeared finally , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
these are now Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a 20 years after his in@@ vention .
in the section every German one is now looking for 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; we need to learn to learn the smartphone even times away , &quot; said straight Jan@@ ina sphere , in the Siemens Management Board for staff . &quot;
permanent accessibility is now valid as a cur@@ se and blessing at the same time .
England must expand the olymp@@ ic spirit and He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row is not only in our local municip@@ alities and in the whole of London but throughout the country of renewal and prosperity .
&quot; for me this presented the greatest attraction of He@@ ath@@ rows , just as at that time in 2012 in London , when we benef@@ ited a great effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions of the games benef@@ ited . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be reached again by creating new opportunities for res@@ ident and companies in the vicinity of He@@ ath@@ row new possibilities .
&quot; for our local communities we will already create 10,000 new jobs , 40@@ .000 new jobs and prepare the youth unemployment in the air environment . &quot;
&quot; so how to advance us in London 2012 , it will be such that the challenge of the expansion of He@@ ath@@ rows is too big . &quot;
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will bl@@ ame ourselves on the world stage .
the two @-@ fl@@ er had been wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every question . &quot;
how the Olympic Games is He@@ ath@@ row for many and not for individual infrastructure project .
extension is an opportunity to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in wit@@ ness@@ ing growth and to leave a leg@@ acy of skills and employment in both the airport as well . &quot;
&quot; we have been implemented a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has been implemented a £ 11 billion US infra@@ structural agenda in time and budget , from T5 - the five years in a row for the world &apos;s best air@@ voy@@ ant distance to the T2 , which was built in the middle of the two frequ@@ ented range of the world . &quot;
&quot; now , they are ready to deliver a third running time , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot;
the London games from 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time that we expand this olymp@@ ic spirit and He@@ ath@@ row as well as our future trade and create a leg@@ acy of skills and employment to be proud of the England .

&quot; for companies , who earn money with Online@@ bo@@ ads are coming according to one of the software attempts to handle , advertis@@ ment block@@ ing , a &quot; cat and mouse @-@ play &quot; same . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that there would be advertis@@ ements on its desktop creation , published Ad@@ block Plus a blog@@ post that users could update their filters in the program to once again be able to block advertising on social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook with that his desktop is subject to change the co@@ ding concerning his promoti@@ onal display to see it scor@@ es about it , which is part of the site advertising to fri@@ ght@@ en . &quot;
Ad@@ block pro@@ claimed that there is a new way to move the new code .
&quot; in a blog@@ post written the spok@@ es@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ und @-@ H@@ er struggle between the coll@@ ecting Open Source Community and the envelop@@ es already since the in@@ vention of advertis@@ ers in progress is , &quot; and that it is possible to come back soon with a new solution . &quot;
&quot; the fact that the world &apos;s world &apos;s world has left its social media in the struggle , is a strong indi@@ ces for it , such as wor@@ rying scor@@ pi@@ ers for the industry . &quot;
&quot; according to a study , according to a study of the last year from Page@@ fair and Adobe around 200 million people scor@@ pi@@ ers ; almost four times as much as 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1,@@ 03 billion daily active users who access Facebook over their mobile devices , hand@@ y@@ listing 84 percent of the advertis@@ ements made fac@@ ebooks . &quot;
&quot; the company has been able to block it on Desktop PCs except as mobile display @-@ block@@ ers no effect on fac@@ ebooks mobil@@ er app for social network and inst@@ agram accounts , shared a spok@@ es@@ man with . &quot;
&quot; advertisement on Desktop PCs makes a sufficient large proportion of revenue , such as Facebook the investment of such step@@ it appears as worth@@ while . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook with that it would be &quot; advertis@@ ements &quot; to update the people more control over them . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday said Facebook that Ad@@ blocks new filter had been wor@@ rying , because they would also be able to block content on the side they are no advertising . &quot;
&quot; for users this does not constitute a positive experience , therefore we plan to address the problem , distributed a spok@@ es@@ man on Facebook in an e @-@ mail message . &quot;
&quot; advertis@@ ers are a bl@@ ink@@ able means , which is why we have focused on developers tools such as Ad Preferences have to put more control into the hands of the people . &quot;
Mrs with susp@@ ect su@@ icide rate on Swiss highway
the sacrifice was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls witnesses to having a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday with a susp@@ ect su@@ icide of several vehicles on a highway .
the inci@@ dent occurred on the A1 near Morges in the Cant@@ on Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman placed himself in the Dark On@@ es in an act of desp@@ air , on the road and were hit by several cars , said the police in Vau@@ d . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss town at the age of 49 years , which was transferred by several vehicles , including a lor@@ ries , even kill . &quot;
she died even on the spot .
&quot; several drivers have already done already , but some are still not identified , said the police , who calls this as well as any witnesses of the inci@@ dent , to report . &quot;
&quot; it was opened a refres@@ h procedure , what is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter from Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
however it remains to be seen if one of the driver will be displayed .
was a conflict avo@@ id@@ able ?
&quot; this is something that the Prosec@@ ut@@ or must decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers will not be held ac@@ coun@@ table .
&quot; in each of the two cases - where a person was going on the highway on the highway - was decided that the motor@@ cyclists will not assume that a pedestrian , in the middle of the night on the highway , as it was in the newspaper called . &quot;
&quot; last year a polic@@ eman was acqu@@ itted , after she had left a man and killed that in August 2014 a night was located on the A1 near Pay@@ erne . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had dr@@ unk , and has become conscious on the road consciousness , took the court . &quot;
&quot; the court established that the polic@@ eman -- that had answered on a call , -- on a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the road had an &quot; completely exceptional and un@@ predic@@ table situation , &quot; said the Jud@@ ge . &quot;
anyone who has further information about the inci@@ dent on Thursday in the vicinity of Morges should be placed under the police on number 0@@ 21 644 83 46 or 0@@ 21 644 44 44 .

scientists at the God@@ d@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of the NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorith@@ ms that res@@ em@@ bles by air @-@ resear@@ ches .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once could have had similar conditions . &quot;
scientists have previously pointed out that the slow re@@ turn of the Venus could be explained by its tight atmosphere .
&quot; but the most recent simulation points out that the Venus could have had a thin , exhau@@ sted atmosphere could still have turned off . &quot;
the model also lighted the top@@ ography of early Venus .
&quot; the planet has pres@@ um@@ ably more dry areas than de earth , but had once enough water and ge@@ ographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and before faster sus@@ pen@@ sive power . &quot;
early Venus also benef@@ ited from a sun that was 30 percent .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model@@ ing simulation , the long @-@ turn @-@ turn of the Venus won the sun for almost two months , &quot; G@@ ISS scientists Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this warm the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which affects the surface of a large part of the solar warmth . &quot;
the result are average temperatures that are some degree of cooler than that of the earth today .
&quot; the model brought a story of Venus that res@@ em@@ bles the evolution , which was previously thought of plan@@ etary research . &quot;
&quot; although it was probably inhab@@ itable , Venus -- in the course of several billion years --@@ being exposed to heat and ul@@ tra@@ violet light . &quot;
your oc@@ eans ev@@ apor@@ ate and their water @-@ fight was burned down from the ul@@ tra@@ violet light .
&quot; when their hydro@@ gen per@@ ched only a thick atmosphere of carbon di@@ oxide with a dead@@ ly green@@ house effect -- the Venus , which as we know it today . &quot;
the researchers divided the results of their new Venus Kli@@ mam@@ od@@ ells in Ge@@ op@@ hysi@@ cal Research Letters .
Patrick Roy occurs as a coach of Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to the right decision of the decision @-@ making of the team .
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will be looking after a new coach . &quot;
&quot; in the last three years I have met my duties as a Che@@ ek machine and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey , the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination . &quot;
&quot; I have thought about the summer long and much about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , this it needs and to bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; to achieve this , the vision of the Train@@ ers and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly adapted to the organisation &apos;s organisation . &quot;
he must also have a co @-@ determination to decisions made the performance of the team .
these conditions are not currently fulfilled .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had raised Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions for the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick has informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we appreciate all what he did for our organisation and wish him all the best for the future .
Roy has been awarded during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of Jack Ad@@ ams Awards as the best trainer in the League .
&quot; he led the association to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was taken in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnes@@ ota , and missed in each of the last years the night season . &quot;
the Aval@@ an@@ ches launched in the 2015 @-@ 16 a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand and they fell behind the Wild for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference at five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame N@@ ups won the Roy Four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
&quot; Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ öl@@ men again take talks on , put disp@@ ute . &quot;
&quot; workers must be exposed to the ab@@ lo@@ ad@@ mon@@ ition of North @-@ oil workers , while all armed parties are exposed to the table , said harmon@@ iz@@ ing leaders . &quot;
&quot; stri@@ kes against the oil producer of the Wood Group , spor@@ adi@@ cally operated on platforms in the North Sea , which are operated by Royal Dutch Shell . &quot;
&quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and RM@@ T trade unions can confirm that we agree to the agreement of the present strike , &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot;
we will stop some full @-@ day meetings in the coming weeks to start the beginning next year to address the problems .
&quot; the unions said that their last strike , who is the first in over 25 years , a prot@@ est against possible pay@@ loads of up to 30 percent . &quot;
Wood Group has abbrevi@@ ated this year to its contra@@ sting in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the rating of the company follows a 10 @-@ pro@@ spective decl@@ ine for on@@ shore @-@ contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts of the company gives the required space to get through the market sur@@ ge .
&quot; shell has announced for its part of thousands of people and plans to leave his oil and gas activities in up to 10 countries as a result of his meg@@ az@@ usam@@ men@@ ades , with the British energy company BG Group ration@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; energy companies are under pressure , a economic situation , which has increased by the decision of the British in June , the European Union has increased . &quot;
Dave Anderson &apos;s members of Dave Anderson met at the beginning of this week with workers &apos; leaders to discuss one of the largest work@@ force that have been held since a generation in the North Sea .
&quot; the North Sea is important for regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and all the country we need a economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion in expen@@ di@@ ture for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of $ 7 billion in the last five years . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures Rot@@ ation rate of stars in the star @-@ course of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Wel@@ be@@ teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the complete catalogue of Rot@@ ation rates under the stars of the star of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data help the astronom@@ ers understand why each stars in the star @-@ way to different ro@@ asting and in which connection the rot@@ ational periods can be found with the planning .
&quot; we hope that we experience through the compar@@ isons of our results with other con@@ stell@@ ations , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Luisa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ Tech &apos;s Infrar@@ ed Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the star @-@ way of the P@@ lei@@ ades is the 445 light @-@ years from the earth .
&quot; many stars in this con@@ stellation , which emerg@@ ed about 125 million years ago , now reach the adult . &quot;
you are turning at the fast@@ est .
excellent rot@@ ation rates upon this strip @-@ stars large amounts of star@@ ch .
&quot; as this win@@ ch is due to the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a brake effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; if a star is alter@@ t , its rot@@ ational rate begins to slow@@ down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rot@@ ational rate of each observ@@ ations by taking the time between the appearance of a recogni@@ z@@ able observ@@ atory -- such as sun@@ spots --
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ary rates points out that massive stars s@@ lower than a few massive stars .
&quot; reb@@ els compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with a bigger star s@@ lower pi@@ rou@@ ette rot@@ ate as smaller . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ball@@ et &quot; the P@@ lei@@ ades , we see that slow radi@@ ors will ten@@ ds , massive rot@@ ors to be massive rot@@ ors to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; as the star @-@ way of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as a ide@@ als cosmic lab , to compare adjust@@ ments like rot@@ ary rates . &quot;
&quot; the observ@@ atory of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers a an@@ chor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; it is still a lot ahead of what we would like to learn more about how , When , When and Why stars are out their red@@ emption and so say their &quot; &quot; dance &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ orn and her colleagues have reported in three newspapers , in detail about their latest analysis of the Rot@@ ation rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;

Rio de Jan@@ eiro - The Olympic Games will be over@@ sh@@ ad@@ ow@@ ed by the first official dop@@ ing .
a kn@@ owled@@ geable Athle@@ tin would have won almost a med@@ al .
&quot; before the seventh competitive day , the first official dop@@ ing of the Olympic Games have become known in Rio de Jan@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese Schwimm@@ ker Ch@@ en X@@ iny@@ i , 3000 @-@ meter @-@ obst@@ acle in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and the Polish Ge@@ wich@@ th@@ eber Adrian Ziel@@ inski were posi@@ tively tested and excluded - immediately prior to the beginning of the residents of cri@@ tic@@ ated Athle@@ tics cont@@ ests this news from the season . &quot;
&quot; in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de has been proven to be used as a mascul@@ ine agent for dop@@ ing . &quot;
the International Sport@@ bun@@ al CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games .
&quot; on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ olds was occupied the fourth place in the fin@@ als on 100 m Butter@@ fly , only around 0.@@ 09 seconds by the Bron@@ z@@ em@@ aille . &quot;
on Friday Ch@@ en should take part in the pl@@ asters over 50 m of free style .
&quot; the opening of the B @-@ sample ( I@@ OC ) , the opening of the B @-@ sample and a hearing is requested . &quot;
&quot; the national Association take the matter &quot; very seriously and demands of Ch@@ en full cooperation with investig@@ ations , &quot; zi@@ pped X@@ in@@ hua from a notification : &quot; we will co@@ operate with the International Sport@@ bun@@ al CAS and will accept the judgment . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history is no longer the I@@ OC , but the CAS for the sanctions of ath@@ letes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also at night by Rio sick@@ ness the message over the positive test at Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went to the offen@@ sive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; this is an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; she told the Bulgarian TV Channel B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; she is inno@@ cent , &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; explained the ath@@ let@@ e . &quot;
the report is supposed to act with the ren@@ dered substance to the blood @-@ offering ep@@ o .
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ owa has been held in contrast , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample has already been beneficial to the B @-@ Probe . &quot;
Bulg@@ ari@@ ens Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ w posted immediately with criticism of Athle@@ tin to Word .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sports@@ men do not draw the right loop , &quot; &quot; said , &quot; &quot; we were standing under observation , so many are already excluded . &quot;
&quot; thus , it may not be able to take all the wei@@ ght@@ li@@ fter from the chron@@ ic @-@ offering @-@ based nation not in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday it was also known as &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski , &quot; the London Olympi@@ ast@@ eger in Class up to 85 kg was successfully tested as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days previously positive to the cat@@ al@@ ole ster@@ oid N@@ andro@@ lon . &quot;

daten@@ kl@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de pres@@ ses hack@@ ers her o@@ bl@@ eld
programmers of Er@@ press@@ ors @-@ Malware you currently have targeted companies - and are successful .
&quot; according to a current survey of the Malware to Ab@@ wehr @-@ specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes under 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany were 40 per cent of the question@@ ed firms in the past twelve months at least once , partly several victims of a attacks . &quot;
in Germany almost 20 percent of companies have already been the target of ran@@ som@@ ware re@@ comp@@ ression .
40 percent of victims are paid by the per@@ petrators to use the proposed systems and data to be used again .
the per@@ petrators are speci@@ alised their em@@ be@@ ers @-@ software according to the observ@@ ations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes on attacks in corporate networks .
&quot; if it successful , they are successful there , the pot@@ entially aff@@ ol@@ ly higher higher than with private actors . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of p@@ oll@@ ut@@ ant software , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ Chef Marc@@ in Kl@@ ec@@ z@@ yn@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of the hardware programs are still designed to send advertising . &quot;
then the per@@ petrators are discovered software for itself .
&quot; only , Privat@@ e@@ er were the target , but the change to corporate attacks were carried out quickly in the past few months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware is working after a simple pattern : once on the computer of a sacri@@ fic@@ es , she looks for un@@ long changing files such as Word@@ - , ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as to archives of images and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ ted the ran@@ som@@ ware and delet@@ es the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
then the software will be presenting the demands of the pres@@ sur@@ es .
&quot; to get the enco@@ ded code to the files , the victims will need money - mostly in the form of Cryp@@ to@@ ill Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; but where to use private use the personal photo database on the game , it comes to companies in sen@@ sible customer data base or project databases , without which the production of still@@ stand . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , higher the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware pro@@ poses . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of the affected German companies engaged in sales by Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent needed even to break the business activity , in a case people were in living . &quot;
&quot; in Germany there were already several hospitals victims of attacks , whose patients can be threatened by the loss of psych@@ o@@ ak@@ age ac@@ ute . &quot;
&quot; we always say the victims is always : pays not , you only encour@@ ages the problem , &quot; explains Kl@@ ec@@ z@@ yn@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; but 80 to 90 percent of firms , pay their data again . &quot;
for managers it is difficult to re@@ ject the requirement of the per@@ petrators in the operation of the per@@ petrators .
the h@@ acker again know this and try to build a good reputation .
in a recent study the security measures have been investig@@ ated by F @-@ Secure the usability and contact the contact with the pres@@ tige and come to the result : the per@@ petrators are actually trying to create a kind of customer service to receive more money .
&quot; you explain their sacri@@ fic@@ es by chat , as they can pay by bit@@ coin , free accessible support sites or de@@ cryp@@ t any example files . &quot;
&quot; and become separate individuals after payments of just a few hundred euro , company must be di@@ stor@@ ing hard and pay five dig@@ its to get their data un@@ encryp@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; given the potential high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from the Ran@@ som@@ ware mail@@ ing , the h@@ acker will always be professional and share the work , explains safety dar@@ ling Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from Anti@@ virus @-@ vend@@ ors : &quot; &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware of about within a week . &quot;
&quot; however , more prob@@ able is that it is about three or four persons . &quot;
the programmer sell their harmful software then in the form of a software building to the actual salvation .
&quot; the previous Malware to have been created by the mal@@ ware , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; included is an adap@@ tor tool , so that smaller configur@@ ations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be modified , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the pres@@ ses are then looking for further h@@ acker to spread the fresh software under the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; one can therefore log in one of the forums in the underground , purch@@ ases the set of a cri@@ minals , and a further order to install the software on as many PCs . &quot;
payment can be made per plug @-@ in calcul@@ ator .
&quot; usually , the cri@@ minals then bear sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies who will ensure their data better .
over 50 percent of firms @-@ IT leaders in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes pol@@ l trust that ran@@ som@@ ware can be able to def@@ enses using file @-@ Back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
&quot; accordingly , the per@@ petrators already pursu@@ ed new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryp@@ tion of data is not sufficient for successful creation , the per@@ petrators instead threat@@ ens with the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or pri@@ cing , &quot; explained Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ chef Marc@@ in Kl@@ ec@@ z@@ yn@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; thus , the sound of potential is higher than before the type of data is more than before . &quot;
&quot; also , the per@@ petrators we could fully take new goals on the internet of things in the basket . &quot;
at the Hack@@ er@@ conference de@@ fc@@ on demonstr@@ ating safety for@@ gers as they could have been using the Internet of thermo@@ stat under their control .
in the middle of the winter the release of a der@@ art block@@ ed heating so man@@ or victim will definitely be worth a lion .
if the per@@ petrators then instead of heating in the future a whole production road in a factory could block ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a topic in industry 4.0 .

&quot; in the small HR @-@ V I want to packing : a little SU@@ V , a little co@@ upon and even the versati@@ l@@ ity of a mini@@ v@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; sound quite over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was built on the same new platform as the new jazz , pro@@ ves in everyday life as well as extremely flexible . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1,@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V affects both the passengers both in the first row and in the f@@ ond lot of space , there is no place in any place . &quot;
the materials of the interior are well finished and work comfortably , just the cock@@ pit @-@ side falls as something . &quot;

&quot; the trunk is well venti@@ l@@ ated , however , the counter of 650 mm is slightly higher than the compar@@ ative Peugeot 2008 . &quot;

it is important that the Minister has been clearly stated in favour of action .
&quot; this was an ear @-@ party in the CD@@ U / C@@ SU , &quot; Gabriel said the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Medi@@ eng@@ group ( Friday ) . &quot;

better traffic @-@ flow on the motorway
it &apos;s a regular basis on the conversion road - here is a picture of November .
&quot; however , this should change : the rule of law should be extended . &quot;
&quot; this is good news for all car parks , which stand in the voc@@ ational traffic on the ambi@@ ent road every evening in the St@@ au , when they drive over the motorway , Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
the state of the street is extended on the coming Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the range between the hammer road and the departure Wes@@ eler road the legis@@ lat@@ ure in order to 700 meters .
motor@@ cyclists can then be connected directly from the hammer road to the right hand .
the great advantage : traffic shares continued to improve the overall stand@@ ings on the complex section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U Group in the district of Münster @-@ West .
the road@@ view on the Zu@@ br@@ inger NER@@ VT the motor@@ cyclists primarily between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
&quot; on week@@ days , the return to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her path and sometimes also beyond . &quot;
the reason is the needle in the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ eler Street .
from here the traffic is only reduced by the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be re@@ built in front of a good three years ago .
the reason : static calculations had revealed that the bridge no longer has the required load @-@ carrying out mainly to record the heavy @-@ road traffic .
&quot; as long as this comm@@ pass and the connected struc@@ tible St@@ au , the local state can not say . &quot;
&quot; however , the bridge has been expected for years : for the bridge has an official restric@@ tion duration up to 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the legis@@ lat@@ ure , the state of the state has become aware of the busi@@ est time into school criteria because with disabilities is expected . &quot;
the traffic will be passing on Tuesday and on Wednesday at the construction site .

rain instead of Stern@@ tal@@ um : hope for weather @-@ better
the weather has made the star nu@@ cle@@ us gu@@ ck@@ sters in the south @-@ west of Germany in the night to Friday a line by the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was great for clouds and rain , we have been able to observe the Himm@@ els@@ spek@@ tak@@ el , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Fri@@ day@@ morning . &quot;
our hope lies on the night on Saturday .
&quot; the weather should be good , then we will surely see many observ@@ ations on the sky . &quot;
&quot; with the stars , Per@@ si@@ den , which belong to 216@@ 000 kilometers per hour to the fast@@ est stars . &quot;

relaxing night : tips to sleep
&quot; in the evening , you meet etern@@ ally , at night it is long @-@ long aw@@ ake , in the morning it is far from the wo@@ unds and no longer think of sleep . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , one with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep dis@@ rup@@ tions and more than ten per cent emp@@ lo@@ ys their sleep often or permanently than non @-@ relaxing . &quot;
how do you have sleeping problems or sleep ?
&quot; there are several forms of sle@@ eves , and there are many different causes given to them , Hans @-@ Günter We@@ ed , the committee member of the German Society of Insomnia and Insomnia . &quot;
&quot; what one under@@ stands , but is the Insom@@ ni@@ um , so is one single and sleeping @-@ filter@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; just sleep , many people find as uns@@ atisfac@@ tory or in@@ sufficient , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , Member of the member of the German Haus@@ cancer association with practice in the lower Sax@@ on Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind bed@@ liner ?
the causes of sle@@ eves is complex .
&quot; behind it , organic , psych@@ ic or durable factors , but also medicines stu@@ ck . &quot;
not rarely is the sleeping expression of any other disease .
&quot; very early it is especially with depression often , &quot; &quot; says We@@ ed . &quot;
and it can be that different factors reg@@ ret each other .
&quot; for example , for example has a band pre@@ cip@@ itation , can be bad@@ ly , awak@@ ened all two to three hours and starts to s@@ alu@@ able about everyday issues and -@@ care of s@@ cour@@ ing , there is an example . &quot;
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
from when should one sleep with sleep @-@ disorders to the doctor ?
&quot; for those who could not talk about a month of a month at least three nights per week , and the day is affected , should the doctor go , betra@@ y@@ al We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the imp@@ air@@ ment can look very different , tired , tired , un@@ inter@@ off , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has hard @-@ tails or physical dis@@ comfort such as stomach or head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; to lin@@ ing the sle@@ e@@ disorder , it is important to figure out their cause . &quot;
&quot; as a treatment options , differ@@ ential practices , a cogni@@ tive behavi@@ apy or even medicines - classic bed@@ tab@@ let@@ ins only in the equ@@ ili@@ ence and at most for two weeks - in@@ query . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze has st@@ ressed by Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze , head of the Interdisciplinary Research Center of the Char@@ it@@ é Univers@@ ität@@ smedi@@ zin Berlin . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one should first turn out in sleep @-@ problems at first time . &quot;
the can clari@@ fy with investig@@ ations whether the problems have a physical cause .
who was going to sleep in the sleep @-@ laboratory and what happens ?
&quot; in the study in the dor@@ mit@@ ory physi@@ cian , for example in snor@@ ing with resp@@ iration , in bed@@ time , if you do not find the cause of a le@@ ap disorder , explains Fi@@ etze . &quot;
we do not need to prepare for the study .
one should spend the day normal .
&quot; only please do not have lunch &quot; , &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
after the short@@ cut we go to bed to his normal time .
&quot; besides the electro@@ des on the body , one carries a nas@@ al br@@ ille , a chest strap and a g@@ low@@ ler in finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera is characterized by a blank@@ et to the sle@@ eves . &quot;
how can those affected the problems get into the grip ?
there are quite a lot of pitches where you can put for better sleep .
&quot; cir@@ cus counts on : regular sleeping and performance times , not too long in bed , the day do not sleep , not to sleep , alcohol , and at night does not start on the clock - then you start now and not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;

&quot; in a country where an Olympi@@ ast@@ eger 20,000 € award gets and a jungle ker 150,000 € should not be surprised about missing med@@ als , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old at night on his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the convey@@ ing system in the swimming pool is bad , the dop@@ ing contro@@ vers@@ ing were very good . &quot;
&quot; thus , we cannot compete with countries who encourage a lot and do not even operate with countries in the theme of Dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls are to be adjusted , &quot; he stated . &quot;

airport : Ban@@ de of B@@ agg@@ age
Professional di@@ si@@ eves at the airport in Düsseldorf
civi@@ lian police force on Thursday the capture of two women and two men aged between 50 and 61 years .
the Tat@@ ar had been committed to a ban@@ ana several rot@@ ary and luggage @-@ al@@ arms .
&quot; at 21.@@ 30 p.m. , civi@@ lian officials visited in the area of the airport in Düsseldorf a ban@@ anas , which was well known the polic@@ emen of past rob@@ ber@@ li . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several dolph@@ ins since mid July of this year , and were successful , working , and especially professional . &quot;
&quot; the specialists of the cid @-@ Com@@ miss@@ ari@@ ate 34 can have the servant that trav@@ elled to the provi@@ dence of pun@@ ishment to Germany , four de@@ eds . &quot;
&quot; however , they had a total of more than 15@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; from the first glance , the Riga Road in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sha@@ in works on the first glance it is not so , but the police are among the &quot; dangerous locations &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; one goes along the road from east to west , one gets to play camp@@ grounds , a refres@@ h@@ ated kinder@@ garten and a Bi@@ ol@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; to the fa@@ ç@@ ade of a gray house , someone has &quot; ug@@ ly &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; opposite of a Li@@ dl , which should also be dem@@ ol@@ ished again : until 2017 , there will be a house with high windows and 133 new ten@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; article about this &quot; trend@@ y district &quot; as the competent office of Friedrich@@ sha@@ in is called in the last weeks however , preferred cars with burning cars . &quot;
&quot; reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile have the inhabitants of rent , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; especially of the Berlin interior H@@ enkel has been several times since the beginning of the year , the police fought against the project , the area as &quot; no @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as a starting point of autonom@@ ous violence . &quot;
&quot; after on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ smith were vac@@ ated , pat@@ rou@@ ed the police three weeks long official statements made with 30 to 40 officials and three teams on site , block@@ ed parts of the street and stopped visitors to enter the house with the number 94 . &quot;
meanwhile the renovated land@@ workers on behalf of the unknown house owners the rooms .
&quot; on 13 July , the Berlin Board of Directors was decided that the cle@@ aring illegal was illegal and a day later moved police and builders under the Ju@@ bel of Symp@@ ath@@ is@@ onds and residents . &quot;
&quot; in this summer , the road works peaceful : parents go with children to walk , people sitting on the pav@@ ement in front of the houses in the sun , others are enter@@ tained . &quot;
in the immediate vicinity of the main projects are a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
&quot; left violence is not the headquarters of many candidates : Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives since 1999 at the Kie@@ z , and Jana * , who runs here three children , above all of the police presented . &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of the skin projects , they share the concern for increasing mis@@ sil@@ es and gent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
it does not sound according to a ja@@ w who was multiling@@ ual pol@@ ishing protection against v@@ and@@ ali@@ ating left .
&quot; the dit@@ ch , the Berlin Interior , and the police between home@@ work and their neighb@@ ors , does not exist so obviously . &quot;
&quot; Friedrich@@ sha@@ in in the east of Berlin actually was a traditional workers &quot; , &quot; which is also possible in comparison to the rest of the city . &quot;
&quot; the land@@ ings in the former G@@ DR : 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former G@@ DR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer street very close to the Riga . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer has been ev@@ acu@@ ated under large police force , many of the projects have been leg@@ alized in the ri@@ aer and are still inhab@@ it@@ ated by the people who had occupied it 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district in recent years has become increasingly for magn@@ ets for tourists and elect@@ oral institutions from all over the world : with them , the group from G@@ DR @-@ times and former law@@ makers have their ja@@ w . &quot;
this also makes us notic@@ eable with the ten@@ ants that has ris@@ en almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
&quot; many of the re@@ constructions in the Rig@@ aer are att@@ acked as symbols for this development , one recogni@@ zes them in which sli@@ ces or fresh@@ ly stret@@ ched fa@@ ç@@ ades , which were thro@@ wn by color . &quot;
&quot; no other street was mentioned as many times together with the words &quot; &quot; Herz @-@ Autonom@@ ous Violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of the reason that not all ours can be seen as problem , may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime against cri@@ minal off@@ ences such as body vulner@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the most part of the imp@@ air@@ ment make experts from , the tend to meet the new buildings and fresh renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Kerstin Z@@ ech@@ auer , who has been in a le@@ ather@@ edge for 17 years next to the contro@@ versi@@ al 94 , can be no talk of in@@ security . &quot;
&quot; what imp@@ lies , it is shel@@ ving : the people in the 94 are their neighb@@ ors that don &apos;t have been . &quot;
even the famous burning cars give it straight to the Rig@@ aer for longer .
&quot; for the studied architec@@ ture@@ tin is not a cri@@ min@@ er foc@@ al point , on the contrary , one helps each other , lives together on the street and gets more each other than elsewhere . &quot;
new@@ born is deli@@ ber@@ ately drawn into the Riga Road and has remained .
&quot; so it was also so important to get their street : from the police , the politics and the media , which in July all suddenly sought the diplom@@ acy about the part of the city . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of residents such as new , the road will continue to pass away : through stret@@ ch@@ less re@@ constructions in former building blocks , which is the old residents . &quot;
&quot; these are the last con@@ dom@@ ini@@ um , which are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so well concrete , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction can I absolutely not gu@@ id@@ ents .
&quot; but what should you do , if you never hear someone ? &quot;
&quot; the fru@@ stration consists of all sides a fru@@ stration , even in the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; for sub@@ contr@@ acted , which anno@@ yed about d@@ oves , Kerstin re@@ incar@@ nation has little understanding : the perspective effects and the left scene belong@@ ed to pine . &quot;
&quot; who draws , it should be aware of - just like anyone who runs in a ta@@ vern , there poor@@ ly compla@@ in over noise . &quot;
all of the persons appearing only have asked us to be called by their correct name
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is new fuge@@ e offic@@ ers
Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in terms of integration and organiz@@ er .
&quot; furthermore , it is social @-@ workers on the spot . &quot;
Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le the re@@ fuge@@ e offic@@ ers for Ur@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the social @-@ ped@@ agog@@ ue also supports the team of administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger . &quot;
&quot; it sees itself as a contact person for all stak@@ eholders : refugees , working prize re@@ fuge@@ e , administration , authorities and who else remains . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer from the working circle indicates that the volunte@@ ers are more than thank@@ ful that D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the ei@@ er@@ leg@@ ende Woll@@ mil@@ chs@@ au , which mainly has encounter@@ ed a problem . &quot;
&quot; so , some - less potential than on the variety of plans we want to pur@@ sue even more pur@@ pos@@ e@@ ful , when managing the place wanted to write . &quot;
&quot; sought a administrative procedure with a talent for languages and people , associated with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just an ei@@ er@@ leg@@ ende Woll@@ mil@@ chs@@ au . &quot;
&quot; yet , administrative work is not its central area , says Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; most of all , it comes to organization , work with the local people and also behind the scenes as well as networks . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been around for around six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent spot for three years old .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer , that Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le ehr@@ en- and haupt@@ werk actors supported . &quot;
&quot; there are big and small problems , organis@@ ational , human and understanding . &quot;
soon new containers are at the W@@ as@@ strasse
&quot; a serious problem has been recognized for some time , apartments for connectivity who have been recognized . &quot;
for the connectors are the local authorities .
you have to accommodate the refugees in your own or ang@@ emi@@ ets living rooms .
&quot; the cost of the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must wear the municip@@ alities itself . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the land@@ mark on commun@@ e and job center .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every land@@ lord wants to offer his apartment . &quot;
the search has been designed for some time than very difficult .
de fac@@ to find managing no private apartments .
&quot; it has not yet been working to have been dependent on private apartments , so d@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , common apartments must be ert@@ ed as it is so beautiful . &quot;
so soon new containers are placed in the W@@ as@@ strasse .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword is Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le .
&quot; in addition to a solid stay , there are prac@@ tition@@ ers , training places , school@@ ing , A @-@ Euro jobs and hel@@ es activities for refugees and migrants , which must be found or set up . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reported Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the builder or help hous@@ ings , done char@@ itable work - and the motiv@@ ated and very neat , as Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
they hop@@ ed that working for the Common Market leads to a positive foreign effect .
that is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but not only work . &quot;
the day needed a fixed structure , say D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop an enc@@ ir@@ rig@@ ation .
&quot; so it offers how sport , contacts with loc@@ als and especially language courses . &quot;
Professional courses are rar .
&quot; so , you also jump with administration and hon@@ orary . &quot;
&quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling , they are welcome in Germany and welcome . &quot;
the long duration of the process is a problem .
&quot; you must explain the refugees that it just takes , and they can take the time sen@@ timent , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who@@ ever came the feeling of feeling , he could not work in Ur@@ bach any@@ body , might not work and be unn@@ able , who will never integrate . &quot;
the clear majority is motiv@@ ated .
&quot; but this is also , the customer says honest , &quot; guys , where nothing is going on . &quot; the work of D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
all of this is a &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : do the two following the recent occurr@@ ences are afraid of radic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer really clearly , &quot; &quot; what man@@ cher na@@ ï@@ ve name &quot; . &quot; a res@@ risk could be able , and do not want to exclu@@ de them . &quot;
sensitive results are the hel@@ pers already .
these acci@@ dents are also subject to refugees .
they would have the fear that the attacks bring them completely in call .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; so , Main@@ - and Hon@@ orary local presence must be made in the area and in the region according to activities . &quot;
they always have in the background that soon became a new shock of refugees and migrants to Ur@@ bach .
need Germany a ceil@@ ing ?
&quot; this question is clear to answer , the policy . &quot;
&quot; actually , it is un@@ fair to place it hel@@ pers . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we are not yet there where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , that would be able to relax . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher have already been trig@@ ger@@ ed , so that people have to be reasonable . &quot;
&quot; there are currently about 100 people , mostly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , they are helping them are both women . &quot;
the political world of world is as complicated as there is no simple answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : engra@@ ved with heli@@ cop@@ ters
