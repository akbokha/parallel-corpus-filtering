<seg id="1">Clintons and Trumps Economic Policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">We invest in infrastructure and to prevent the trade agreement TTP - they want to do both Clinton and Trump.</seg>

<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to regulate the economy to death, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in contrast, it would be quite different, claims Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">He will return meatings and he turns strong up for a far-reaching tax reform with lower wheelchairs strongly - for professionals and for companies.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton against it says: the state has certain duties to fulfill, he has a disadvantage opportunities to open and needs money."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, the taxes would be increased for the rich, says it."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"to be invested in the rivers, say Trump and Clinton is almost superficial."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic applicant announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic politics and are rejected by the state-critical Teaty-wing of the Republican."</seg>
<seg id="16">"thus, in Trump, they could still have partying discussions too."</seg>
<seg id="17">Significant are the differences in energy and climate policy.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build charcoal and coal promotion in the USA again.</seg>
<seg id="19">"oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas, the Paris climate protection wants to cancel it."</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton wants to build renewable energy costs with their investment program and demands: "a country will create the superpower of the cleanses energies and millions of jobs.</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"however, not only in the infrastructure - even at international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far away from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpazific trade agreements, they both do not want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both but they do not want to isolate the US for international trade - but just American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">The should then also be paid better than Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current waglohn from 7,25 US dollars was a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">She wants to increase it on 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump does not want to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum stay, then he says he might not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">Yet the major discussion of the coming months may well be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics hold him before so that the household deficit would only be greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">"Clinton at the other side is Clinton, who wants at least demand for the rich that they pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are also not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce the hands and proclaim an official end of eight months to proclaim the words of the words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin wants his Turkish counterplayer in the gilded hall of St. Petersburger Palastes, I can not devour the intrusion that Ankara that wants to most omreconciliation."</seg>

<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan went to his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report whole five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I could no longer count.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also spoke that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even better to improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day there was a newspaper that Erdogan would have been taken as if would never be something unblended.</seg>
<seg id="11">I seemed to be interpreted more on the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin exradiant, sustainable radile showed that the state of Russia had nothing forgotten."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first of what he mentioned in his introductory: the abolition of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moskah's reaction to the time was angry.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Putin came from and accused Ankara, Russia in the back to be fallen."</seg>
<seg id="16">The trial was even greater, since it was committed by a routed friend. "</seg>
<seg id="17">The vetris rebuild back is difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia have changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months long the state-controlled media have a hefty, unlimited attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">At once it seemed to be the Turks for all the blame.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the most serious officials were the allegations of conductive officials, that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria, who have been controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He has disputed this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but in St.Petersburg the official message, that there was time to look forward."</seg>
<seg id="24">"after all, this meeting took place only because Putin was received from the President Erdogan the sorry that he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to win a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara the benefits of a ceasefire are clear on the hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Erdogan needs first and all friends who he can get, after spending last month in a failed coup of almost his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeat terrorist attacks on Turkey also have shaken it.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have met Turkey - especially the ban of charters, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is reduced by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia will be relieved in Russia, and charters will be relieved when the flights will be back."</seg>

<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry to the West as it was a response to the tried to attempt to be used as weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in addition, the persistent Groll on the Schneckentempo the EU-accession negotiations and Putin - who is aroused out of the cool mood and decrease the relationship of Turkey to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian state of State gained in Ankara with security a bonus that he has asked for the tried to promote state-rich support for the chosen community organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is a self-evident for Moscow, which itself has a deep fear of regression."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit meeting in this gloss Palace at the sea possible to allow Russia and Turkey, one as it described me a analyst once described," Alliance of outsiders, and poorly dealt with and badly. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"however, despite the public reconciliation, exist between the two still great differences."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as a peace-fans, but where Russia and Turkey has been able to support Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be indicative that after nearly three hours at the first prize, both President at the press conference said that they had not even striped striped."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey remied it clearly on a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize these."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on how a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>

<seg id="25">And at some points - in the inetreatment of gedular for example - imagine the question: what does it actually have to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror."</seg>

<seg id="3">"before you hurry to the comment on the pseudonym, for him under the pseudonym of non-alysis, this statement leads from the current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the variety of sound plates is not attributed to a boom in Millennials, who want to welcome the realism of physical objects, but to bring back to Midlife-nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those recently bought a record are of all advance after the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact the age group of 18-24 is the most unprobable group.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes due to Hobbysammers - it has an emotional significance: older records runners keep their feelings rather for himself (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it to spend their own time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog would be a news report on television, I would follow me the camera while I consider the midst of a busy road in Soho, a modest ascent to stop and wildly say like:" "so, let us take a close look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">"so, let us take a look to it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"even if the heart of Sohos is slow in his charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once an independent seller - there are still a handful fantastical turntables."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would probably ask the camera to turn out the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and soul."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I have from Sister Ray (data cells: two men middle ages, one woman, probably around the 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill out the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collectors I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already appreciate," says he. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"this sound flats, above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I am not followed him at home), dress the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of its available income: it is now able to buy plates, which he could not afford to buy them, when he was released, as he was young and plastly."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I bought, are from the late 60's, early 70s, who appeared as I was 11 or 12. things I probably have something to be young to buy them," says he. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees to those that are buying, more introverted and like to spend their own time and add:" I smoke not much and I would not drink very much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my Laster.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers who meets the YouGov's Profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he also noticed a new wave of people who have influenced by the Medienhpe, people who have heard over the comeback and let go back to buy their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations that I have led, people usually did as a rule in 1998 or 1999 of their collection."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once used their records sold to buy CDs, now sell their CDs to buy their records once again."</seg>
<seg id="26">This would be the boom of followers of a particular age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional significance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to acknowledge that turnout a soothing community of indigesinns.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to WEZ, some of the older customers participated in contactless payments system."</seg>
<seg id="30">Some turntable fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to withdraw to the stability of trust soundtracks, of objects, the happiful juices. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the colt of a void or the possession of the possessions of the possessions as a kind of comfort," "says WEZ."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is for me as collectors and I think it is so for many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "we are like their social worker!" "have a staff of a platter."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey of ICM in April announce that nearly 50% of people who bought this month a record, they have not yet been stopped."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found that 41% have a turntables that they never use, while 7% of those who own a record, no turntables."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of the report, I would probably look very worried while I formed by a stack at Bossa Nova compilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works in Sounds of the Universe (Data: three Man middle ages), has noticed a" "trophy" of revivals. "</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone recently came here and said," "I got no turntables, but I would like to buy a radio record, so I would like to ask them into the shelf," says he. "</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it is definitely going to happen."</seg>
<seg id="41">NumberlandTechnologyNews-2010-07</seg>
<seg id="42">"we have people who say," I have no record player. "</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older that only slowly pursue."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fopp, which devoted to the sound plates nearly a whole floor has a blower audience than I rejoe."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and women middle ages."</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Beasts's Synthesizers and sexbepacker Pop instead of experimental jazz instead of the loudspeakers - it is good to see such a diversity among clients.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them sees other lonely; but nagging psychic traumas are hard thinkable if one stands next to someone over 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, has been around for a few minutes in the business and looks the Varietower of the plates available for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It is more of a mannequin than a big purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">"she does not deserve much, so the collecting panels are not a real option, says it."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to hear music from a computer or to listen to other way but the beauty of plates is... they drives with a deceived seufzer.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it is really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">"my last stop is a shop, from which it is said that a new generation of turntables have to be inspired: urban outfitters."</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I give up the shallow, to watch the jeans hotline, I watch a group of young teenager to grouping for a moment to buy Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter to buy a crosley turntables."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"no one sees it - maybe because they are only purely decorative, some so far above it is impossible to address them."</seg>
<seg id="58">"it is pure" "winding". ""</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that every attraction for these items mean more money to the industry and to send some customers to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"there is no surprise that a population group which has more time and money than others, also the one is to most suitable for Luxor areas like plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even though my descends that the results of YouGov right, they let at least in record business in Soho, the great number of female speakers in the reality, the record and in Onlineforen exist, not into account."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning with security not with the bucket by turnout of the Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while the strong view of an unsurian, 30-year-year wrong moderator to the shoulders does not exceed the shoulders of average men of middle ages."</seg>

<seg id="7">"Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a Frauenfeld with dimples, could certainly have been sent among these known names, which would be sent to Prime Time, which would be sent to Prime Time, if he would be a swimmers, turn, or even real."</seg>

<seg id="11">We will always have the breast swimming and may it be long.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I would like to make arguments for my certain darling, then let me make the attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline."</seg>

<seg id="28">"the purposeful pursuit is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir even an audience."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I look at the spectator of these games as a bit tireless.</seg>

<seg id="4">Witnesses say that zig protesters were killed during the collisions with the police were killed in hardship.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia precisely here?</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the last ten years it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid origin of the West with a fast growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but in the last few months protests protests against the government, and far more affected in more and more areas."</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week the thousands of people on the streets and longed fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The response from the government was unlawful according to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses gave to that policemen responded to zig inarmed protesters and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the re-run videos about the protests, the probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how to beat young people with stomachs, while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The boss of the UN-authority for Human Rights now demands an incoming investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to maintain this country and in future it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is after Nigeria the most complete country of Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopia, to fight terrorists about the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa if ever, so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia and Economy expire in a respectable speed.</seg>
<seg id="17">His infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new counterpart in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean. "</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia, everything else was an example for democracy - human rights organisations, all the repression has led by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, with discretion effective to sweat."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent to exile or in prison, killed or in the wilderness of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people suppress and these no other options have except to protrut it from," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protrusted.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that all depend on the Bodennese up to the throws in terms of power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"according to a wide range of last year the ruling party received the ruling party, and its allies the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time the tensions walk along the border to Eritrea; a battle for this cackery, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June hundreds of life."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analyst advocates that separatists as the Oromo-liberation front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, who have more or less forced to armed the turbulences, and they could refrain."</seg>
<seg id="29">To explain several factors why feelings of bitterness after years of emankle falls under the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, many Ethiopia is able to communicate with the social media, since cheap smartphones have always been more common and improved the internet services."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter, what they are at regular intervals, especially with protests, so many people can still talk about internet-proxies you can hide."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopia said that they gathered themselves so to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethes in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"since the ministries, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia mostly Christian highlands, in politics and economy, while the Oromos had been pronounced, of which many Muslims are living and in flat areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But even this is changing just.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are dedicated to co-ordinate under a screen," "said Mulatu Chechu, a leader of the Oromos."</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests were held in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which are roughly 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, in trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former Rebal leader, was up to his death on a non-publik proclaimed disease in 2012 17 years in Ethiopia. "</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was regarded as tactical genius, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">"analysts say that he was particularly versified in it, early signs of dissatisfaction and special commissions to use opponents and make them unharmful."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime is missing in this fundamental," "said Mr. Abdi, a conflict-analysis."</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopia, new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected from relatively unreliable reasons to take the position of Mr Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"different from Mr Meles, who came out of the Tigray Region Nordaeopiens, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analyst say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the Tigray controlled security services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many feared that the result is more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time that Ethiopia was made such a rebellion in 2005, after thousands against elections protested, which was sealed from the government and then stolen by the government."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following sweeps, many protesters were killed, even if it was less than in the last months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"Development experts, praised Ethiopia, as well as the new counterpart, as well as the new penalty track, as well as for their measurable advances in arguess."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this does not have the intensification of the internal miserable of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethical form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month, protested in Gondar, a amharic city, from Tigray guided shops and the hate towards the Tigray in the social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analyst say that the protests will bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American administration used to Ethiopia as a basis for drongations about the neighboring Somalia, even if they recently said this base has closed."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West does not want to support democracy, he does not want his allies in a already volatile area."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," "said Mr. Abdi," "is a very thin cruise."</seg>

<seg id="12">"Ransomware is working after a simple pattern: once on the computer of a sacrifices, she looks for unlong changing files such as Word-, excel- or database files as well as to archives of images and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypted the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the software will be presenting the demands of the pressures.</seg>
<seg id="15">"to get the encoded code to the files, the victims will need money - mostly in the form of Cryptoill Bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but where to use private use the personal photo database on the game, it comes to companies in sensible customer data base or project databases, without which the production of stillstand."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, higher the damage occurs when a ransomware proposes."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of the affected German companies engaged in sales by Ransomware, 13 percent needed even to break the business activity, in a case people were in living."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany there were already several hospitals victims of attacks, whose patients can be threatened by the loss of psychoakage acute."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say the victims is always: pays not, you only encourages the problem," explains Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"but 80 to 90 percent of firms, pay their data again."</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the requirement of the perpetrators in the operation of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hacker again know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study the security measures have been investigated by F-Secure the usability and contact the contact with the prestige and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to create a kind of customer service to receive more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">"you explain their sacrifices by chat, as they can pay by bitcoin, free accessible support sites or decrypt any example files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and become separate individuals after payments of just a few hundred euro, company must be distoring hard and pay five digits to get their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"given the potential high and relatively risky profits from the Ransomware mailing, the hacker will always be professional and share the work, explains safety darling Chester Wisniewski from Antivirus-vendors:" "a single person can write a ransomware of about within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">"however, more probable is that it is about three or four persons."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmer sell their harmful software then in the form of a software building to the actual salvation.</seg>

<seg id="32">The presses are then looking for further hacker to spread the fresh software under the victims.</seg>

<seg id="34">"one can therefore log in one of the forums in the underground, purchases the set of a criminals, and a further order to install the software on as many PCs."</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment can be made per plug-in calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually, the criminals then bear spammer with the spread," explains Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known by many companies who will ensure their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of firms-IT leaders in the Malwarebytes poll trust that ransomware can be able to defenses using file-Back-ups and scannersoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">"accordingly, the perpetrators already pursued new strategies."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data is not sufficient for successful creation, the perpetrators instead threatens with the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing," explained Malwarebytes-chef Marcin Kleczynski. "</seg>

<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword is Regine customer and Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a solid stay, there are practitioners, training places, schooling, A-Euro jobs and heles activities for refugees and migrants, which must be found or set up."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reported Regine Customer. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the builder or help housings, done charitable work - and the motivated and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports."</seg>
<seg id="33">They hoped that working for the Common Market leads to a positive foreign effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "but not only work."</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needed a fixed structure, say Deuschle and customer. "</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop an encirrigation.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so it offers how sport, contacts with locals and especially language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">"so, you also jump with administration and honorary."</seg>
<seg id="41">"it is central that the refugees get the feeling, they are welcome in Germany and welcome."</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the process is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"you must explain the refugees that it just takes, and they can take the time sentiment, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"whoever came the feeling of feeling, he could not work in Urbach anybody, might not work and be unnable, who will never integrate."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"but this is also, the customer says honest," guys, where nothing is going on. "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">All of this is a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: do the two following the recent occurrences are afraid of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," "says Regine customer really clearly," "what mancher naïve name". "a resrisk could be able, and do not want to exclude them."</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensitive results are the helpers already.</seg>
<seg id="51">These accidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the attacks bring them completely in call.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Customer. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"so, Main- and Honorary local presence must be made in the area and in the region according to activities."</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that soon became a new shock of refugees and migrants to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Need Germany a ceiling?</seg>
<seg id="58">"this question is clear to answer, the policy."</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to place it helpers."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we are not yet there where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle. "</seg>
<seg id="61">"no new refugees, that would be able to relax."</seg>
<seg id="62">"Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher have already been triggered, so that people have to be reasonable."</seg>
<seg id="63">"there are currently about 100 people, mostly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in need, they are helping them are both women."</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world of world is as complicated as there is no simple answers.</seg>
