Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not online .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as via T@@ eher@@ an dest@@ abil@@ ising policies in the Middle East .
&quot; but during the meeting , it should also fight about the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ state solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been very excited for years .
Washington cri@@ tic@@ ises the ongoing settlement of Israel and ra@@ ises the Net@@ any@@ ahu def@@ ective will of the peace process .
by the Obama respon@@ ded deal to the Iran@@ ian nuclear program has got the relationship of the two further det@@ eri@@ or@@ ated .
&quot; in March Net@@ any@@ ahu had stopped at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans in front of US Congress , which was held in part as an aff@@ ron@@ t against Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not talked with Obama , a meeting had rej@@ ected this with an indication of the upcoming election in Israel . &quot;
&quot; in a call , Professor , his girlfriend were shot &quot;
in a call I told Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb with a somewhat z@@ itt@@ y voice of the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials to come to his home .
&quot; Lamb was so important to emph@@ asi@@ ze that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; are still l@@ ebe and probably excited , and he said , the family contacts of dead women could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; within the house the officials found the hear@@ sal of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ en , and a hand@@ written notes , which I was doing so sorry , I could be loved , I loved myself . this was the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; there was no notice that Lamb , who trav@@ elled in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ veland , Mississippi , En@@ ns , already 300 miles to the school grounds , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office and killed . &quot;
Delta State University pol@@ ish Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that University &apos;s staff have heard at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb has made the con@@ ce@@ ful emer@@ gency eventually after that .
&quot; until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took the life , when the police took him . &quot;
&quot; a day after the shooting in the university , the students and lec@@ tur@@ ers , forced to hide behind ver@@ tically doors , the authorities still try to get an image of what &apos;s motiv@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the operators of both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped him to draw a picture of a talented , but perhaps difficult teachers . &quot;
Students said they were on his lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where he died , he did not know the story of violence or a cri@@ minal pre@@ history . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt itself had been mentioned in one of him , in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; , &quot; with whom he divided his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both tra@@ des in the Department of Social Sciences and History , their teaching bodies have 17 members , and many students visited courses of both . &quot;
at the same time there were some incl@@ ination to problem@@ atic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ a@@ vers , the Lamb , he said , he appeared a little excited and nervous as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that lam@@ b told him that he had to do with stress at the end of 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for an in@@ clin@@ ed out of health reasons and that he had any health problem .
this year he en@@ closed only two online courses .
&quot; recent amend@@ ments proposed in the employment policy for the university was meant that the promotion , for the Lamb is so hard , for him has no guarantee for an automatic path to a statement as assistant professor . &quot;
&quot; the president William La@@ For@@ ge said he kn@@ ow@@ ed nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something into Mr Lam@@ bs conception . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb is no longer able to answer .
&quot; after the escape from the campus the police took place later , when he returned to Mississippi from Arkan@@ sas . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , kis@@ sed Lamb with one .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about one m@@ ile south of his parents house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ ane Johnson . &quot;
his car went still in the entry .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why lam@@ b came to this house , but Johnson said that he believes that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
Lamb grew in the area .
&quot; Lamb began his work at the University of which 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught Ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he gradu@@ ated in spring in ped@@ agog@@ y .
&quot; one of the many years of friends Lam@@ bs dre@@ w him as intelligent , char@@ ism@@ atic and funny . &quot;
Carla H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met together through sharing friends .
&quot; she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool el@@ derly guy who tried to teach a guitar player . &quot;
he was then the Women &apos;s black .
&quot; all girls mel@@ ted , when he was there , said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson suburbs of Bran@@ don . &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously quite some time together .
&quot; in the emer@@ gency , Lamb , I have killed my wife , but there was no diplom@@ a from a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the back@@ stone house , which is adjacent to a ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were 15 years ago , but friends had stayed and a daughter who was now 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was completely destroyed in the ground , &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he did never met me , but he was heard through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail , he was interested in music and blues playing . &quot;
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail three years ago both on a summer season .
&quot; later , they played together the one or another Gi@@ g . &quot;
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter and s@@ ings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nur@@ se who worked for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ man and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Jul@@ ep Room , a weak lighted bar close to Gau@@ tier , said that he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ful Night at night September 5th for the last time , having completed his guitar@@ - and harmon@@ i@@ ous audience . &quot;
there was no signs that anything is wrong .
&quot; just a Happy Couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the au@@ ti@@ dying and j@@ ok@@ ing together .
I mean they had both a good sense of joke .
&quot; Schmidt , the Dead Professor , introduc@@ ing the first sem@@ ester Study program and specialized in US U@@ indigen@@ ous and kol@@ oni@@ ale history , said Don All@@ an Mitchell , a English @-@ professor at the school . &quot;
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was the president of his br@@ other@@ hood and of the student .
&quot; on the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ veland on Tuesday evening about 900 people , including teachers , staff , students and members of the municipality at a cand@@ le memorial . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ mid@@ ts Mrs. Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the memorial , while the university &apos;s &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; amazing grace &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the lessons will be added on Wednesday again .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Rog@@ el@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ veland , Mississippi . &quot;
associated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story was correc@@ ted to dis@@ gu@@ ess that the police now says that Lamb had failed , having stayed in his emer@@ gency , and that lam@@ b in his emer@@ gency , although his wife was signed , but there is no indication that the two ever married . &quot;

8 Shift values indicate that Donald Tru@@ mp is seriously to take .
some have tried it as a flop at brand @-@ brand .
others have done it as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some re@@ public@@ ans try to drag Donald Tru@@ mp from the upper p@@ ushing for sur@@ veys right down , it has not working ( yet ) does not work . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national sur@@ veys showed Donald Tru@@ mp in the two @-@ dig@@ it sector , and some begin to seriously sur@@ veys what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ations of real estate . &quot;
of course it is too early in the legis@@ lat@@ ure .
none claims that Tru@@ mp probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emph@@ asi@@ ze that at this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s guide was handed over to the rising Herman C@@ ain that none of them won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general choice .
&quot; but beyond Bush@@ ings , such as J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super P@@ AC and the conserv@@ ative econom@@ ia group for Growth now recognis@@ e tru@@ mps b@@ ills and begin to flow their dollar to over@@ throw him . &quot;
here are some current conversion levels that indicate that the estate @-@ Mog@@ ul is not only a temporary phase :
Tru@@ mps exposure levels have turned 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp , his can@@ did@@ acy in mid June announced , showed a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University , that only two of ten Republi@@ cans made the real estate Mog@@ ul positive . &quot;
until the middle of July it was 40 percent .
in early August there were 52 percent .
&quot; now , six of 10 Republi@@ cans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
about three of ten they say that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa last week noted that 60 percent of the Republi@@ can have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two thir@@ ds of the GO@@ P @-@ vot@@ ers GO@@ P would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
&quot; in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week said 67 percent of Republi@@ can , they would be either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if Tru@@ mp would be nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of 10 say , they were &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot;
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son creates approximately the same enthusiasm such as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; &quot; enthusiastic &quot; &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same above Tru@@ mp ) . &quot;
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 per cent of Republi@@ can elect@@ or@@ ers say that they would be &quot; un@@ happy &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; , &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , the candidate . &quot;
a majority of the re@@ public@@ ans provides Tru@@ mps temper@@ ament not as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tru@@ mp is crucial for its bom@@ bas@@ tic and offen@@ sive statements , 52 per cent of among the re@@ public@@ ans ten@@ sions , that the real estate agent had the right temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is in the first choice of the nation , the State of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ can think that he has the personality for a thig@@ h@@ ant , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless 44 percent , that he did not have the personality to perform effective office , and almost six of 10 independent pro@@ claims that his temper@@ ament is not into the White House P@@ asse , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can W@@ ers used to get involved in the idea .
&quot; if they set up their schol@@ ar , keep their republi@@ can elect@@ or@@ ate Tru@@ mp for real . &quot;
&quot; when they are asked , who wins GO@@ P @-@ nomin@@ ee , say after a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C from the last week four of ten that Tru@@ mp is the best bet . &quot;
this is a change since the time when four of ten put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
complete dis@@ closure : GO@@ P vot@@ ers had not the clear@@ est stone ball in the past .
&quot; at this time in the last cycle four of ten Republi@@ cans , that Rick Per@@ ry had to win the nom@@ ination was only 28 % for the final Candi@@ date Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it shows that a variety of GO@@ P vot@@ ers w@@ ns campaign as pl@@ au@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; even if the re@@ public@@ ans themselves gathered for another candidate , Tru@@ mp suggests almost everybody . &quot;
some experts refer to that the sh@@ atter@@ ed field probably contributes to tru@@ mps guide during the anti @-@ Tru@@ mp support on more than a do@@ zen of other candidates .
&quot; but a survey of the mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head @-@ race between Tru@@ mp and most other republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; in front of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead , in front of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally presented to edge Paul , John Kas@@ ich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ an @-@ head @-@ race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate that be@@ ats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would run the entre@@ pren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald @-@ Tru@@ mp fans tells that they have made their opinion .
&quot; a new survey of CB@@ S / ny@@ t on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the vot@@ ers , the Tru@@ mp tell you that they will for@@ give their voices . &quot;
&quot; of course , a lot of things can happen to change this , and no one can truly say that never change the opinion . &quot;
46 percent said that they are open to the door to change other candidates .
&quot; yet , tru@@ mps stron@@ gest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ on Ben Car@@ son , but vot@@ ers that they have made their opinion twice as often for Tru@@ mp . &quot;
six of 10 Republi@@ cans are saying that they agree with Tru@@ mp at the subject of imm@@ igration .
&quot; since then , Donald Tru@@ mp became his election campaign against two months imm@@ ig@@ rants from Mexico &quot; rap@@ ists , the imm@@ igration and fishing point in the public dis@@ course of 2016 . &quot;
some are worried that the bom@@ bas@@ tic expression of Tru@@ mp determin@@ ant His@@ p@@ ano @-@ Americans will be remote from the Republi@@ can party and re@@ orientation efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday say six of 10 Republi@@ cans , that they agree with Tru@@ mp for imm@@ igration . &quot;
&quot; so long as the imm@@ igration in the spotlight , it will apparently do . Donald Tru@@ mp seems to do . &quot;
the fru@@ stration was cli@@ m@@ bed over the government moving up to new states .
&quot; at Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son , there is now about half of the support of Republi@@ can vot@@ ers , especially through their out@@ si@@ ders status . &quot;
six of 10 Republi@@ cans are saying in the new Mont@@ agen survey of ABC / Post ; they prefer to prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they are also angry to Washington .
&quot; a survey of Des Mo@@ ines Register / Bloom@@ berg in I@@ owa began two weeks ago that three of four I@@ owa Republi@@ cans are demonstrated by the re@@ public@@ ans at the congress with 54 per cent &quot; &quot; un@@ happy &quot; &quot; and 21 percent &quot; &quot; hell@@ ish &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Munich , Sylt and Co. : the five exclusive resid@@ ing in Germany &quot;
here in the Hob@@ ook@@ en@@ weg there is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea .
in the street it costs a square meter of a can@@ opy in the cut 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; at Sylt the offer is limited to objects naturally , so it is in the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which special layers of a square meter costs .
&quot; of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square metres for a student &apos;s students in Munich are not really little . &quot;
as opposed to the top @-@ residential areas comes from one of the price as Pe@@ anu@@ ts .

Müller received a final help of Olympi@@ ast@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who left the first captain of the World Masters at its 28@@ th in the Champions League at the Champions League . &quot;

&quot; however , the Bavaria , has been defe@@ ated in seven Europe @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
they went through cour@@ age@@ ous ran in their offen@@ sive efforts but often too up@@ beat .
the attacks have been led to many times by playing on the left side of Douglas Costa re@@ directed against the former Braun@@ schwei@@ ger Om@@ ar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ oui .

&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk to lose teeth &quot;
&quot; he smo@@ kes he is not just the lungs , but also the teeth - that places a Pots@@ dam@@ er Lang@@ s study . &quot;
the good news : when ren@@ unci@@ es the risk quickly .
smo@@ kers have a much increased risk to lose your teeth early .
&quot; this emerg@@ ed from the long @-@ term study of an international research teams , including several members of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smo@@ ker , the risk of losing their teeth at pre@@ matur@@ ely , in order to lose weight up to 3.6 @-@ fold . &quot;
the scientists have observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
&quot; main causes for tooth dec@@ ay be car@@ ies and in@@ flammation of the fl@@ esh@@ are , emphas@@ iz@@ es the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
for this peri@@ odon@@ ti@@ tis is smoking an risk factor that the authors emph@@ asi@@ ze .
the connection between smoking and tooth loss occurs therefore on the most common fl@@ ats of fl@@ esh@@ g@@ ums .
deli@@ ber@@ ate be sure that smoking also increases the risk for car@@ ies .
&quot; people who heard with smoking may reduce their risk but within a short time , the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could last over ten years until the end@@ anger@@ ing was back to the level of non @-@ smo@@ ker , first author Thomas Dietrich by the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; people were per@@ su@@ aded to per@@ su@@ aded , non @-@ smo@@ kers , pro@@ claimed H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking short@@ ens the life time . &quot;
not to smoke is good for lung and vessels and leads to our findings also to a good dental health to the high age .
&quot; in Germany , over 20 percent of the population affected by the age of 65 to 74 years of dentistry , the DI@@ f@@ E included . &quot;
previous research had already pointed out that smoking is the risk for early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study study the findings .

the Swedish @-@ din has to introduce the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating force in the free trade union with the US .
the German government announced support .
TTI@@ P is intended to create the biggest Free Trade Area of the World with 800 million people .
&quot; the plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings , specifically , that the EU states and the US have jointly made independent judges for a new investment Court . &quot;
&quot; they are to come to the same parts from the EU , the US and third countries . &quot;
planned for the first time is also a second instance .
it would allow it to be used to collect counter@@ parts .
&quot; previously , the reporting participating in refer@@ ee was refer@@ enced to refer@@ ee , an obj@@ ectivity against their jud@@ g@@ ments . &quot;
in the discussion of the past months have become clear that citizens will not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice .
&quot; long @-@ term , she wants to go to her own details on an International Investment Award . &quot;
&quot; there , you may also be clari@@ fied for example between Chinese companies and the EU states . &quot;
the particular invest@@ or leaders are regarded as one of the main reasons for the large resistance in Europe against TTI@@ P .
&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration are cri@@ tic@@ ised of opponents as a kind of parallel army , about the company damage caused by tax@@ pay@@ ers , national laws des@@ pon@@ ds or a reduction of consumer protection and environmental standards . &quot;
in the first opinion of anti @-@ TTI@@ P organisations such as camp@@ act the proposals made by the European Commission as in@@ sufficient .
it was mainly cri@@ tic@@ ised that they are not intended for the free trade agreement with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) .
the German economic state Secretary by Matthias Mak@@ es ( SPD ) were conc@@ eived as a great step forward .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission considered the reform of essential points , the Federal Minister of Sig@@ mar Gabriel worked in spring with other EU @-@ trade minist@@ ries . &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration was removed from the table .
the French government welcomed the plans of Malm@@ strö@@ m .
the European business Federation Business@@ Europe war@@ ned to rest@@ rict the complaints with the economy through too many new rules .
&quot; particularly small and medium enterprises could thereby be dis@@ advantaged , it was called . &quot;
&quot; when the discussions on the free trade agreements TTI@@ P ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) may be completed on Wednesday un@@ clear . &quot;
the negotiations have been run since the middle of 2013 .
&quot; however , the subject of investment protection has not been discussed with the US . &quot;
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement was already at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is considered not more durable .

Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ ns Deb@@ rief at the Prime Minister of the Prime Minister
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the Prime Minister of Prime Minister with voltage is expected in his election .
the new Labour President Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ n shall place his debut at the Prime Minister of Prime Minister and for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise up to face the first of his six qu@@ ot@@ ted questions briefly to noon , whereby his performance is probably examined by the media and the Labour Party . &quot;
he called &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he has also said that he could lead some meetings to overcome them pe@@ ers .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns guidance , as it comes after its appointment as a member of the Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ etts , and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the decision of the Labour chairman , on Tuesday during the singing of the nation @-@ year during a comm@@ em@@ oration of the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence to be har@@ den@@ ed , criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MP@@ s pro@@ vo@@ ke and is at the center of several covers stories in newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Decision , not to sing the nation @-@ hy@@ m@@ ne , has drawn attention to himself &quot;
&quot; a spok@@ es@@ man of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he could have been &quot; &quot; in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; and he has recognized the &quot; Hel@@ er@@ ess of the Royal Air Force in the air@@ line &quot; &quot; England . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ ou@@ et , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC two News@@ night program , he made the Labour leaders to sing , &quot; regardless of his belief that the mon@@ archy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; almost a do@@ zen of shadow @-@ minist@@ ers have agreed to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns excellence , and they are called on differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a six@@ ties of the parliamentary party was originally supported as leaders . &quot;
the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also within labour &quot; post office &quot; and after Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns statements to the position of the European Union and the limitation .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour changes excep@@ tionally to remove the entire idea of a limit .
&quot; later Mr Smith , the sh@@ adows @-@ working and pension Minister that the party was &apos; very clear &apos; that they can only cut down against the government to reduce the limitation of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour Chairman since David Cameron that he has since been T@@ ory @-@ Chef in the last decade over the Dis@@ patch @-@ Box in the parliament .
&quot; the Labour Chairman , who promised another policy review , says that he said &quot; &quot; Cro@@ w@@ d @-@ s@@ ourc@@ ed &quot; ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30@@ ,000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; Is@@ lington North MP said that the question@@ ing of the Prime Minister is too con@@ front@@ hic , and that he is subj@@ ected to both &quot; &quot; impact &quot; &quot; and the fight with with@@ h@@ ooks , and instead it made to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle that is represented on the shadow of your prime minister when he is not participating - for example when Mr. Cameron on the go on the road .
&quot; he has also brought the idea to the interview , that other colleagues sometimes sei@@ ze the Word , and that he spoke to John Ber@@ cow , the spok@@ es@@ man of the house , addressed to the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he was leader in 2005 leader , Mr Cameron that he wanted to pur@@ sue himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le theatre &apos; . but some years later he dre@@ w that he has failed in it . &quot;
&quot; as she was posted in television first in 1990 , the frag@@ ment with the Prime Minister has been viewed by the Prime Minister and his guidance under his parliament@@ arians , although cri@@ tics have been ar@@ gu@@ ed , she has become a caric@@ ature and reg@@ ulate far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

&quot; the po@@ und leads to data , which has an increase in pay@@ growth in the United Kingdom . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the Ser@@ mon SA@@ BM@@ iller . &quot;
between May and July the result of bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9 % compared to the same pre @-@ year period .
this percentage was since 2009 the fast@@ est and brought the estimates published at the time of a fin@@ ite .
&quot; the po@@ und rose by more than 1 % compared to the dollar on $ 1,@@ 55@@ 05 and was up to 0,@@ 84 % compared to the Euro to 1,@@ 37@@ 30 € . &quot;
the FT@@ SE 100 Index concluded with an increase by 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market , and made a jump of 20 % , after acquisition @-@ offering of the Rival AB In@@ Be@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies of the world and are trademarks such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
bur@@ berry shares were to encourage news from the competition @-@ Group to Rich@@ us@@ goods Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % higher .
&quot; Rich@@ ey &apos;s newest out@@ lets have to hit all expectations , and showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - again growth . &quot;
&quot; stocks of gl@@ enc@@ ore rose by 5 % , after the Berg@@ b@@ aur@@ i@@ ese said that he took an EUR 2.5 billion US $ through a stock of stock as a part of his strategy of school@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; the shares of the packaging and paper Jew@@ ry Mon@@ di were the largest los@@ ers on the index , and with a decl@@ ine by 4.3 % , after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had its assessment of the company rating on &quot; &quot; sell . &quot;

the Chief of J@@ D Sports says that higher w@@ ages are the expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees &quot; more sm@@ itation could mean in the pockets of the potential customers .
&quot; but it was un@@ likely that this will be the higher labor force in his company , says he says . &quot;
&quot; the cost could make the expan@@ sion@@ control of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that might mean that there are less extra jobs . &quot;

PE@@ GI@@ DA @-@ Plak@@ ate has Leb@@ thes@@ es on pot@@ ato @-@ W@@ oods @-@ idea
pot@@ atoes or pot@@ ato ?
&quot; both are both - and in the pot@@ ato @-@ temple dedicated to the Ol@@ den@@ burger tak@@ e@@ ater Han@@ i Al@@ h@@ ay . &quot;
&quot; inspired by the Sp@@ ru@@ ch &quot; pot@@ ato &quot; instead of a poster of the PE@@ GI@@ DA movement , Al@@ h@@ ay pot@@ ato and meat was put together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot;
the idea brought him a poster at an PE@@ GI@@ DA demonstration with the wor@@ ding of pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er who he acci@@ dent@@ ally seen on television .
&quot; since then , in his store he is a barbecue , which is equipped with meat and pot@@ atoes . &quot;
&quot; this is multic@@ ultural for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ h@@ ay . &quot;
the idea has now to enter into the patent office in Munich at the patent office .
&quot; there , it has been protected by the authority of the authority since recently as a utility model . &quot;
&quot; how much meat and how much pot@@ atoes of the sk@@ ewer , Al@@ h@@ ay will therefore not give away . &quot;
&quot; only so much , &quot; it tastes together even better , &quot; he finds . &quot;
even with its customers the culinary del@@ im@@ ism arrive well .
Met@@ ering starts Bod@@ enst@@ än@@ k@@ eit @-@ campaign to fight against Al@@ di@@ - dispos@@ ing
Met@@ cash attempts to protect the I@@ GA branches in front of an Al@@ di @-@ march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food @-@ wholes@@ alers has started a Bod@@ enst@@ a@@ ison campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 stores will be prepared in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , will strengthen pro @-@ cash supplier and marketing the brand I@@ GA by ma@@ instre@@ am marketing and marketing over the social media , as well as Adel@@ a@@ ide @-@ Show . &quot;
&quot; I@@ GA tra@@ ders and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice manufacturers of Simm@@ ons from D@@ uns@@ borough , distributed in I@@ GA stores samples and retail , the cultiv@@ ated tickets for the South of Australian Tri@@ liga to loy@@ al customer . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to publish further details of its defence assets on 29 September , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and devices under@@ take its annual investors &apos; Strateg@@ ic Day . &quot;
there is much on the game that South Australia and Western Australia can be nearly 30 percent of met@@ cas@@ hs I@@ GA spaces and higher profit mar@@ gins as a met@@ cas@@ hs I@@ GA network in the east states .
&quot; in South Australia and Western Australia not@@ ables , provin@@ cial and Que@@ ens@@ land have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in Western Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to roughly 14 per cent in the east states . &quot;
&quot; however , analy@@ sts like Morgan Stan@@ ley that Al@@ di twelve months after opening of its first markets around five percent of food market in these two states hit , but mainly self @-@ handed retailers only will take away . &quot;
&quot; in this week , the Analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath sent by Morgan Stan@@ ley that I@@ GA re@@ ta@@ iler 360 $ million euros a year and will lose $ 250 million $ until the end of 2016 . &quot;
this pro@@ gn@@ osis is based on assu@@ mption that Al@@ di will be opened in the next year 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA and will achieve a turnover of 500 million $ and 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food shop and at the amounts on met@@ cas@@ hs high fixed base could cost Met@@ cash around 13 million $ gain before interest and taxes . Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ cash market shares in the east states , mainly on Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan took out that I@@ GA starter is the faithful . &quot;
Morgan Stan@@ ley increases the Met@@ cas@@ hs turnover in the food and food shop at 3.8 per cent in 2016 by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2017 and will reduce the market share of 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.6 percent by 2020 .
&quot; last week told the leading Fond@@ s@@ manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , at a business eating in Melbourne that Met@@ cash will likely be going within a decade . &quot;
Met@@ cash lo@@ ves it off to respond public to the comments made by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is understood that a committee member of Met@@ cash starts with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; IG@@ As market share has been dro@@ pped for 2010 by 18 percent to 14 percent , and income from met@@ re @-@ retail and food trade , which has approximately 1.@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has been reflected in 2012 by 43 percent , resulting in parallel printing on sales and mar@@ gins since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; however , the wholes@@ alers are hon@@ ored and invested more than 150 million $ to provide sales in hundreds of products every week and to supply chain retailers in improving their stores through fast growing fresh food and to provide a better selection of private food products . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ cas@@ hs , Ian Mor@@ rice said that the pri@@ cing and store @-@ storage programmes are to be set to El@@ an and hop@@ ed that the wholes@@ alers will return for the first time in the year 2017 for the first time in four years . &quot;
Than@@ asis Kok@@ si@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis courts Steve He@@ aly
Than@@ asis Kok@@ si@@ ak@@ is deserves more praise than criticism for its behavior .
Than@@ asis Kok@@ si@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; colle@@ ague &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gi@@ os and deserves to view the President of the Australian tennis Association Steve He@@ aly rather praise as criticism for its own behavior .
&quot; co@@ si@@ ak@@ is , the younger men of talented Du@@ os , which is always called &quot; &quot; Special KS &quot; , &quot; geri@@ ed by the inf@@ am@@ ous examination of Cy@@ top@@ os with St@@ an W@@ aw@@ rin@@ ka at the Montreal Masters in the spotlight . &quot;
&quot; in a fi@@ ery qualification game in C@@ inc@@ in@@ nati soon after they had to hit Ry@@ an Har@@ rison twice by the refer@@ ee , the Har@@ rison called Har@@ rison : &quot; W@@ aw@@ rin@@ ka had to hit Cy@@ top@@ os , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; as he recently seen as he sm@@ ashing a tennis vi@@ bes , after a v@@ ap@@ our a potential US @-@ open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet was def@@ ended by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ si@@ ak@@ is def@@ ended from He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth around the second place in the solo behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup @-@ pen@@ alty against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one thing about which I rather den@@ ied , is the fact that after my opinion was Than@@ asi a little into the disp@@ ute , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; he lost a rack@@ et as he lost for a thr@@ ill in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has a rack@@ et of fro@@ sted with himself , and I know Than@@ asis a good enough to know that he is not proud of that . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has achieved extremely well in the US Open extremely well , even among the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was a little too strict covered . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he has never worked into the team and so on , he is still a problem with the other players , he is very stur@@ dy and exhau@@ sted young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged for his own mer@@ it . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to take into account the decision which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right for everyone , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ long @-@ term part into the team . &quot;
&quot; first , we wish that the team is completely focused on the contest and not on all the controllers around &#91; Kyr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; and I believe that Nick was very fast to A@@ scen@@ sion , which he gets involved in the eyes of the public , and he has attemp@@ ted to support him , but we try to give him the consequences of his actions , I think it is best for the team and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe Re@@ fuge@@ e crisis : Hungary says Not@@ ary , clos@@ es the border , holds refugees back
Hungary explains the emer@@ gency and sail@@ ed the South @-@ border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all fixed to come to the country . everything with the aim to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
&quot; chaos followed by the border , as hundreds of migrants in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land @-@ based and Ser@@ bian officials with rebel@@ lion . &quot;
&quot; the people who had fl@@ ed against violence , for an unknown period in a stri@@ ps on the street between the two check@@ points of the countries firm and built tents . &quot;
but fru@@ str@@ ations fell .
as a poli@@ ti@@ cian for them we@@ athers the migrants &quot; open the border ! &quot; and cri@@ ed ins@@ ults against the Hungarian polic@@ eman .
some point out of prot@@ est food and water back .
&quot; Ser@@ bi@@ ens foreign minister declared it &quot; un@@ acceptable , &quot; that migrants would be returned from Hungary while more and more from Macedonia and Greece . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a colle@@ ague .
&quot; in the coming days we must take place talks with Brussels and other countries , &quot; said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the tur@@ bul@@ ence in the Hungarian border line came a day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ block at a strict meeting in Brussels no common imm@@ igration policy .
&quot; however , the Minister agreed to divi@@ de the responsibility for 40@@ .000 men , which would be achieved in over Italy and Greece . they pret@@ ti@@ pped their hope that finally within the next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would achiev@@ es another 120@@ .000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chanc@@ ellor Angela Merkel and Austria demand@@ ed a special summit of the European Union to discuss the imm@@ ig@@ as@@ equality of the continent .
&quot; yet , Hungary continued its hopes for a long run action of Brussels or from its neighb@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday Imm@@ er@@ ected Not@@ ary in two southern regions there were more powers to combat the crisis , so they could speed up streets and as@@ yl@@ um procedures . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian foreign minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plan to build a stand @-@ wir@@ el@@ ly along its border with Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after it has ended a fence at the Ser@@ bian border . &quot;
&quot; Charlie &apos;s News @-@ correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even pris@@ ons have been used in the competition , the St@@ ach@@ el@@ dra@@ ht @-@ fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
Hungary recently has become a significant comm@@ uni@@ tion from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
&quot; the prime minister Viktor Or@@ ban however consi@@ ders that most of the coming econom@@ ies are looking for better life , and not war@@ fare who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly in contradiction with other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new legislation , which leads to midnight in Hungary in strength , make the crossing of the border or the compla@@ ining of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high Za@@ ffer@@ ing , to set the government along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws also produce higher liability pun@@ ishment for condem@@ ned human re@@ ta@@ iler . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation that emerg@@ ed by the mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the emer@@ gency , &quot; &quot; said government Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs Rep@@ or@@ ters in the southern city Sz@@ eged . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree to the use of the military , which is expected for next week , but repor@@ ter from Associ@@ ated Press have seen difficult to armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ org@@ y Bak@@ on@@ di , Land security advis@@ ors for Or@@ ban , said that authorities to cross the border to cross the border , 15 others were already deeper into the country . &quot;
&quot; they summ@@ oned by placing the fence , so they are now in police cust@@ ody and become the provi@@ dence of pun@@ ishment according to the new laws . &quot;
authorities are there to be quick to fix the fence .
&quot; Hungarian officials closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after an enc@@ wag@@ on with St@@ ach@@ el@@ dra@@ ht to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos sur@@ rounds the most important Gren@@ zen@@ stein , near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary as the Hung@@ arians need a small office in a metal containers in order to process the data of people and oppressed a sense of people to go there . &quot;
&quot; around 20 succe@@ eded , but thousands of people remained outside . &quot;
another group of migrants are block@@ ed the most important highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would still den@@ y food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clin@@ ton War@@ head before Ber@@ ne S@@ anders in national survey
&quot; the former U.S. Prime Minister Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ dig@@ it lead in the democratic race for nomin@@ ations on the national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins you against ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has now support 47 percent of democratic vot@@ ers at the pres@@ idential elections ( 58 percent earlier ) , while S@@ anders stood in second position , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announce whether he received the pres@@ idency of the pres@@ idential Council , receive support of 15 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers of the pres@@ idential elections . &quot;
&quot; over five months before the beginning of the pre @-@ elections , most democratic vot@@ ers say that it is too early to say that their opinion will be determined by what candidates they will support . &quot;
&quot; but Clin@@ tons suppor@@ ters are in their choice faster than those of the other candidates . &quot;
&quot; since the CB@@ S @-@ News survey has lost Clinton at a series of dem@@ ographic groups , while S@@ anders had achieved some gains . &quot;
Clinton keeps a great advantage in women and temper@@ ate but these proposals have to be reduced .
their support in the men is significantly reduced ; and S@@ anders can only be back with 5 points .
Clin@@ t &apos;s advantage of democratic vot@@ ers under 50 years has dis@@ cour@@ aged and they are now on equal height .
but Clinton had a big jump with the older weights .
in the past month Clinton had another with two @-@ dig@@ it adv@@ ancement in the Liber@@ al but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point adv@@ ancement in this group .
&quot; about half of the democratic vot@@ ers of the pres@@ idential elections , they would say that they would support with enthusiasm , if it would be nominated by the party . &quot;
&quot; a quarter would support them with some processes , and another 15 percent would only assist you because they are the candidate . &quot;
six percent they would not support them .
maybe not surprising that Clin@@ tons has current suppor@@ ters especially of you are thr@@ illed .
&quot; the views are stronger mixed by those who did not support Clinton - just about a quarter , she would be enthusiastic . &quot;
&quot; whilst 48 percent of democratic vot@@ ers say they said Clinton with enthusiasm , say fewer mount vot@@ ers to say this about their nickname of Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clin@@ ton &apos;s suppor@@ ters are asked in an open question why they want to be the most common response to the fact that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that it is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
Clin@@ t suppor@@ ters is also previously mentioned in connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to the handling of problems and the ability of linen are also c@@ ited .
&quot; as the Vice @-@ president may be an potential for the pres@@ idential office , 57 per cent of the democratic vot@@ ers of the pres@@ id@@ ents may see him in the race - although one third thought he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; when democratic vot@@ ers of the pre @-@ elections are asked for who for the party would be their second choice , Bi@@ den is at the head . &quot;
&quot; by Clin@@ t follow@@ ers say more than half , that Bi@@ den would be a long way from S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; des decide to can@@ did not decide for nomin@@ ations of democr@@ ats , Hill@@ ary Clin@@ ton &apos;s jump in front of S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in competition at 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; five percent of democratic vot@@ ers see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election , but this figure is reduced by 78 per cent in the last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second with this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; &quot; select@@ able &quot; &quot; has ris@@ en . &quot;
&quot; however , on the question of what is more important in a Candi@@ date , democratic exchange of questions about the applic@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; similarly as last month , not a single democratic cont@@ est@@ ant or potential candidate for this vot@@ ers of the pres@@ idential elections are accep@@ ting as un@@ acceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates are encour@@ aging good results with some important mer@@ its in vot@@ ers of the pres@@ idential elections of their party .
&quot; sur@@ veillance view Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den is considered honest and trust@@ worthy and with strong managers . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den has the best ones at best ones with hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ ton &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot;
thirty percent of democratic vot@@ ers do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy twice as many are saying about S@@ anders ( 15 per cent ) but 27 percent have no idea of him .
the vot@@ ers of the pres@@ idential elections also sees Clinton , S@@ anders and bi@@ den ide@@ ological in accordance with their views . &quot;
with all these measurements about a quarter of democratic vot@@ ers no opinion of different .
&quot; as questions about Hill@@ ary Clin@@ t &apos;s questions about a personal e @-@ mail address and a server used during the term as a foreign minister , most democr@@ acies are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions are not affected . &quot;
but there is another story in the American public .
&quot; half of the Americans now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; in March , public opinion was in March , just after the issue of light came out . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the email contro@@ vers@@ y had no effect on their general opinions by Clinton , although 36 per cent said that their opinion has yet det@@ eri@@ or@@ ated by it . &quot;
&quot; there are mainly re@@ public@@ ans , more than six of 10 , which have said that their views of Clinton are worse . &quot;
&quot; despite the vot@@ ers of the vot@@ ers of its party as honest and trust@@ worthy , this continues to see a problem for them under registered sc@@ oring : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of the elect@@ ors do not hold them for an honest and trusted person .
at the same time 55 percent of the elect@@ or@@ ate land@@ scap@@ ed also see Tru@@ mp as not honest and not trust@@ worthy .
&quot; Clinton and Tru@@ mp , but get good notes at leadership . &quot;
&quot; of the six dedicated candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best with hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority sees something else rather than hon@@ est@@ ly , but like at Car@@ son many do not consider any opinion of him . &quot;
the bug@@ fixes for the sample of the 351 &apos;s democr@@ acies in the pres@@ idential elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves with nation@@ wide survey near Donald Tru@@ mp
Ben Car@@ son is located at the latest pol@@ l of CB@@ S News / New York Times close to Donald Tru@@ mp
&quot; in the two candidates , half of the support of vot@@ ers in the new survey , and others will lose dram@@ atically . &quot;
&quot; Republi@@ can elect@@ or@@ ers strongly support Tru@@ mp in large numbers . the support grows by 23 % in the last CB@@ S survey conducted by Fox News debate last month , around 27 % in the survey of Tuesday . &quot;
but Car@@ son sch@@ oss in the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey has also revealed that Car@@ son deals well with dem@@ ograph@@ ical groups and Tru@@ mp under republi@@ can cloth@@ s with university .
&quot; the rest of the field , except for Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio govern@@ or John Kas@@ ich , who has fallen with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gou@@ ver@@ ne@@ ur Scott Wal@@ kab@@ b@@ ke who is at the deep@@ est , and of 10 % support in the last month at now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; former Florida @-@ Govern@@ or J@@ eb Bush , the former govern@@ or of Arkan@@ sas Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida @-@ Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are located 6 % in third place . &quot;
the Trou@@ blesho@@ oting of 376 people of Republi@@ can vot@@ ers in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , the last week has been published , shows that Car@@ son falls into the envelop@@ e - he lands with 19 % support during the Republi@@ cans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support . &quot;
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tru@@ mp distinc@@ tly in front of Car@@ son .
&quot; with a view over one of the last week ascending Car@@ son , Tru@@ mp finds a few si@@ eves for former neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ ons , even after Car@@ son exc@@ used tru@@ mps faith in question . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tru@@ mp on the last Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the Eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even if excellent values can be measured only in the distance , extends for bath@@ ers already a trip to the Mediterranean to find even hot water . &quot;
a bath in Nord@@ see or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure on a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; no more to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the north and Baltic Sea in this week , the German Wetter@@ service shares ( DW@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; Bad@@ et@@ temperatures still offers the Mediterranean Sea : in the east it even comes up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic it is 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt is on 28 degrees .
five members of the Br@@ other@@ hood Association with the death of a Bar@@ rel College @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ ings
&quot; nearly two years , after a student in a schi@@ z@@ dic rit@@ u@@ als of a student association in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , dec@@ eased , will be submitted against five persons . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Bru@@ der@@ schaft Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during a introduc@@ tory day , which contributed to his death , contribut@@ ing to his death , shared the police . &quot;
&quot; officials said he was loaded with linked eyes with a 30 po@@ und back@@ pack of sand , and repe@@ at@@ edly , while he tried to go over a fro@@ zen field to a target . &quot;
Mr. Den@@ g de@@ pl@@ ed about head@@ aches , then it fell un@@ conscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Br@@ other@@ hood did not pass the emer@@ gency number 911 on , after Den@@ g fa@@ inted and wa@@ ited one hour before they brought him into a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to contact D@@ eng@@ s clothes to contact his symptoms and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national president of the Br@@ other@@ hood , to bring advice , said the poli@@ tic@@ ef Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point the members , ut@@ ens@@ ils began to hide and put the welfare of the br@@ other@@ hood basically about the &quot; Michael Den@@ g &quot; , &quot; said the poli@@ tic@@ ework Wagner . &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved and he died next morning at his wo@@ unds .
&quot; after an auto@@ p@@ inch , Den@@ g were repeated with bl@@ unt strength injury to head , tor@@ so and thig@@ h . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the chic@@ ane of the Br@@ other@@ hood , at least a student die since 1970 every year at the Sch@@ ik@@ anen , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a law@@ yer , the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation . &quot;
fr@@ action and its members must be held to account and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe received a pro@@ sec@@ ution because of the third Gra@@ des for the first five members .
&quot; two thirty members of the Br@@ other@@ hood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with Shi@@ p@@ ans attacks and formation of a cri@@ minal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to responsible for the people involved but if there is an organization leading - officially or in@@ officially - this , we will also draw them to account , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the Bar@@ nes College has forbidden the Br@@ other@@ hood , and the national br@@ other@@ hood has ra@@ ined its affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot;
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases the interest rates
&quot; a number of advertising comes , and the sli@@ ces will rise to W@@ aver , ren@@ dering for bon@@ ds , and the economy will be gli@@ ding into a rec@@ ession . &quot;
this is what we know .
what we don &apos;t know how long it all take and how long it will keep it .
&quot; in particular , the history for the economy is only a small guide to the procedure . &quot;
a rec@@ ession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate and last@@ ed 86 months .
&quot; agg@@ ression of the Federal Reserve on raising the interest rates is often , if not always , a factor where the economy and financial crisis react . &quot;
&quot; therefore representatives of the US central bank therefore emphas@@ iz@@ es that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period that is needed for norm@@ alisation . &quot;
in fact several variables play a roll .
&quot; in the end , the market share , however , that the whole excitement was possibly exc@@ es@@ sive because of a tongue of adver@@ se . &quot;
&quot; the first raise in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is likely to be interpre@@ ted by some as a signal for the end of the &apos; budget money &quot; , &quot; said Julian Press@@ op , Ch@@ ef@@ ö@@ kon@@ om at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of the U.S. interest to normal heights , but still at the low@@ est level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock , to fear that many . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effects . &quot;
here is a historical trends @-@ focused view on how some areas of the economy could react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the advance of interests can make things for a while vol@@ ati@@ le . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the increase in an increase , the impact is not so dram@@ atic . &quot;
&quot; there seem to be a t@@ endency that calls from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which might reflects the delay in monetary policy , said German @-@ Bank Analy@@ sten in a recent study which is subject to interests . &quot;
&quot; more precisely , the market has been in the past 35 years mostly in up@@ wards - about 14 per cent - on the way to the proportion of 9.5 % , with an average rate of yield in the previous six previous cycles of 14,@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis that published Bob Doll , chef at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s asset management . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tend to occur later in the H@@ eight@@ lifting cycle and the rate thus begins to decrease .
&quot; rec@@ sions are a fact of economic , but adver@@ tise it often fo@@ ster@@ ing . &quot;
in the current case the F@@ ed con@@ fron@@ ted with some conditions which could not have been acceler@@ ate and could speed up a rec@@ ession .
most remarkable is that the gross product is close to its low@@ est point in a tick @-@ mining of the F@@ ed .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 was raised by 118 at 118 only twice the nom@@ inal B@@ IP on 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 rose to 3.6 percent , only a few that this will take and expect for the third quarter according to the information of Atlanta F@@ ed only 1.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; interests in such frag@@ ile economic back@@ drop could be ris@@ ky and throw the question , &quot; &quot; whether it is different from this time , &quot; &quot; said the German Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants will have taken all year for a number of inser@@ tion in the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many Strateg@@ ic and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could increase an increase in this session , the Fut@@ ures trade means a pro@@ bability of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study all the cre@@ sts cycles from 1950 to today in a super cycle with increasing cas@@ ing when building the B@@ IP took place and on @-@ rec@@ ession very quickly after the start of recovery in the shade , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery of what the worst rec@@ ession in the observed phase was . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the lon@@ gest , which ended the F@@ ed since the end of the last rec@@ ession , the record was 35 months , and these are now 74 months . &quot;
&quot; the solid income was also vol@@ ati@@ le , as the market takes a proportion of advertising , and the pattern is rather similar in the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect of bon@@ ds is faster than with shares if that will change its strategic course .
&quot; when bon@@ ds the ren@@ dering appear to change the direction , once the first increase / down in the cycle takes place . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the eight@@ lifting cycle , the bon@@ ds immediately fall , said the German bank . &quot;
the Strateg@@ ic of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to collapse into longer and shorter bon@@ ds closer together and lead to a descent of the curve .
&quot; often we often bring better assign@@ ments even in such a climate even though , &quot; &quot; we are still careful to expect higher y@@ iel@@ ds , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fix@@ ed @-@ Income Analysis in Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; interesting , says Jones , that the markets have already been adapted to comp@@ ed @-@ strategy . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decl@@ ine of in@@ fl@@ ational maintenance , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of greater monetary policy . &quot;
&quot; short term interest has ris@@ en , the Er@@ agon is flat , credi@@ t@@ ans have expanded and the vol@@ atil@@ ity has ris@@ en - all the characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed has been cu@@ red its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in large and whole company , companies which will vote in major part of their business activities in the U.S. , when interest rates , and local products can be more attractive . &quot;
multin@@ ation@@ als businesses with high deb@@ ts are worse off since a rising dollar available their products on the global market and also makes the financing of their debt .
&quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; stocks that tend to be extremely positive for three months after an initial tick @-@ mining , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analy@@ sts in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed business with weak record in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 at average by 5 percentage points . &quot;
companies with high capital ren@@ dering as well as low vol@@ atil@@ ity at their shares and also shares their parts with low quality at the average 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
deb@@ ts become a major problem .
&quot; companies with a high proportion of flexible interest are most likely , you said Gold@@ man . &quot;
&quot; outside of pure corporation , the consumer will also benefit from increasing dollars . &quot;
&quot; au@@ sterity could see gains by higher y@@ iel@@ ds , even if experts are different from different opinions , how fast it will take place . &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says parliament@@ arians Andrew B@@ ingham
the conserv@@ ative member of the Parliament cri@@ tici@@ zed the station because of his &quot; thick@@ ening &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is not growing from commercial ri@@ vals .
he was looking forward to the BBC Music Awards and said that she only im@@ it@@ ated The Br@@ its
Parliament &apos;s Dam@@ ien Collins The Voice Of The Voice and said that this is not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; lead to Classic FM , claims a leading parliamentary committee and raise new pressure on the transm@@ itter to prove that he does something for what the private stations do not do . &quot;
&quot; the conserv@@ ative parliament@@ arians Andrew B@@ ingham was also the BBC @-@ Bos@@ ses , that the public @-@ legal radi@@ os@@ as &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished by its commercial bank@@ rupt . &quot;
&quot; Radio 3 - I use the word &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; - but it seems to transform itself to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
he was aimed at the BBC Music Awards that started last December .
the BBC Music Awards that started last year seem to be The Br@@ its only under another name .
&quot; so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples , where you only max@@ imi@@ ze what already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
&quot; BBC @-@ General Director proved to be the pione@@ er back and ar@@ gu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 far before its commercial ri@@ vals , when it comes to live music and clari@@ fication of the public . &quot;
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I will learn about classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really un@@ matched .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 , new music will find and new works on behalf , I feel really for important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey that tou@@ g@@ her to engage the audience when it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; however , Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC @-@ production , which during the hearing held in the Committee for the selection of culture , media and sports to come under fire , the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory ME@@ P Dam@@ ien Collins The Voice of the BBC , the musical talent @-@ show of the BBC , which was purchased from the Dutch producer TA@@ L@@ PA Media for estimated costs 22 million £ . &quot;
&quot; do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not especially distinc@@ tive ? &quot;
Lord Hall was insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show was produced with Pal@@ oma Fa@@ ith and Boy George as judges - &quot; in particular BBC @-@ way . &quot;
&quot; he added , he would like to find the company &quot; a hit from our house &apos;s st@@ alls &quot; when it comes the next time an entertainment series . &quot;
&quot; however , he ref@@ used to exclu@@ de the order from further rows of The Voice in the future or to spend money of the h@@ edge pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats . &quot;
Internet @-@ revenues have been responsible for this in August at slow@@ est side and the Black Friday can be responsible for it .
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month the low@@ est result had been the low@@ est result since the beginning of the Chronic@@ le in 2000
purchase online sales to shop three years ago by using phones to shop
experts believe that the Black Friday has received the spending on November Friday in November
&quot; for more than a decade , the virtual shop has been del@@ o@@ om@@ ed , and many of the main shopping streets of Great Britain have turned into spirit @-@ cities . &quot;
&quot; however , experts say that there are now signs that the online conver@@ ts will be st@@ aged , after new figures only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
the total expen@@ di@@ ture for August presented the low@@ est increase in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
&quot; experts say that there are signs that they are stag@@ gering pro@@ gressi@@ vely , after new figures are only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; if you look at the growth rate for the pre @-@ years and go back to 2000 , then Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G @-@ Verkauf@@ sin@@ dex@@ it to the Guardian . &quot;
he stated that the online sales would be strengthened for three years ago as a buyer began to sett@@ le with their phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments such as at home on the couch .
&quot; but now we comm@@ ent@@ ails that , and we may possibly experience that growth decre@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon that import@@ ed from America is import@@ ed , as one reason for the post@@ ing revenue . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that buyers seeking their purch@@ ases from this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times pointed out the average number of buyers to make their be@@ aks , and some dealers are thro@@ wn . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyer could be fought for snor@@ ing , buyers of this could be made . &quot;
a study of British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium provided that there was a bit more than 1 £ buy online from the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium .
in some products such as TV@@ s and Wash@@ ers more than one third of the purch@@ ases are now carried out on Web @-@ shops .
at the same time more than one quarter of the people buy clothes and shoes online instead of the Mo@@ de@@ ets in the interior .

&quot; the B@@ in @-@ Laden @-@ group has not published any statements about the collapse de Kran@@ e , and its representative were not available for opinion . &quot;
the roy@@ alty is also the group because of not the current security measures and because it does not co@@ operate with Meteor@@ ologist .

B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap European hand@@ y@@ men is over
&quot; British emp@@ loy increasingly crafts@@ men , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Laur@@ ence &quot;
the number of qualified ar@@ tis@@ ans from Eastern Europe has rise beyond

&quot; Ru@@ pert Steiner , City Chef @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent of Daily Mail
&quot; it is all@@ eged to have the British their heads and brushes in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European Cra@@ fts@@ men , who will perform working in their home . &quot;
&quot; if you are sk@@ ill@@ ful with a hammer or a brush for getting walls , you obviously belong to a minority . &quot;

at the moment the men survi@@ ved the men .
&quot; she said it was necessary to face the growing Demographic trends , the more female single @-@ househ@@ olds having more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Laur@@ ie said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our stores .
we have to move this more towards a balance .
&quot; in principle , half of our customers consists of women with 80 percent of decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a big role in the making process .
Mrs Laur@@ y that is one of only five women registered at the head of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index formular , has also interpre@@ ted their top team to reflect a equal number of men and women in a leader . &quot;

cause of A@@ ich / D@@ HL because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity to trial
the Landes@@ gericht Kl@@ agen@@ furt am held on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian Volley@@ ball @-@ Vi@@ z@@ em@@ ei@@ sters A@@ ich / D@@ HL because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and commercial education .
the acc@@ used familiar not guil@@ ty .
one of them had also been charged for Am@@ t@@ sm@@ iss@@ ants .
from this ac@@ cus@@ ation he has been pron@@ ounc@@ ed in May .
the current process has been dis@@ rupted .
&quot; according to Ober@@ stat@@ us@@ sus Robert Ri@@ ffel was transformed into temp@@ tation that the acc@@ used in the years 2006 to 2011 schol@@ ars of the association , about which they used in their functions disc@@ usses , for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; he damage the damage it with around 400,000 Euro . &quot;
the sports@@ men are also charged with financial damage .
&quot; he was decided by the President of the Sch@@ op@@ ener , Rich@@ as Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later time .
&quot; to the throw of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defense must assume that the association was created at no time a property . &quot;
&quot; the sports functional would have had led only effort @-@ damage and the sports club , for which they have been active from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they have invested a lot of time and money , made out the deb@@ ts - passed the passi@@ vation - passed the passi@@ vation of 2001 approximately 600@@ .000 Sch@@ illing ( approx . 44@@ .000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time we stood before the situation : do we carry the club continued or un@@ lock ourselves ? &quot; , &quot; told one of the acc@@ used , in the bread of the corporate level of the financial market . &quot;
with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants he then decided to take this task .
with all risks .
&quot; we have returned from money , our lives as safety in the bank accounts , &quot; he said with the agreement . &quot;
&quot; with the association , you have been agreed : you can manage the money free , it may only be made any deb@@ ts . &quot;
further be - in appropriate financial success the payout of the administration moti@@ fs have been fin@@ alized until 1991 .
&quot; therefore , one of the administration purposes have been paid only years later , namely in 2003 , when a plus was paid to the account . &quot;
&quot; thus also l@@ acks packages - and not detail@@ ing , the former Ob@@ mann explain the proceedings . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and sk@@ inks are governed by the two def@@ endants , the second acc@@ used . &quot;
why the pay@@ outs made by the association has not been realis@@ ed by the judges .
&quot; the association has not been interested in detail for the financial crisis , is important only the debt of debt , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; as in 2011 against the one function , an operation of Am@@ t@@ sm@@ iss@@ ants started , an amount of 120@@ .000 Euro has been transferred to the club account . &quot;
they were before they said the acc@@ used .
this fall photo was taken up on the name of the second def@@ endants and was not known according to his statement from the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; I wanted to know the judge . &quot;
this did not know the answer for a long time .
then he eventually said he has believed that this is the best for the club .
&quot; if something happened to him , nobody would have arous@@ ed something of this money , the Prosec@@ ut@@ or put into the space . &quot;
&quot; the co @-@ def@@ end@@ ant has been informed , justi@@ fied himself the functional . &quot;
this transfer was form@@ ulated as &quot; re@@ union . &quot;
why cont@@ em@@ nity ? we wanted to know Jud@@ ge and Prosec@@ ut@@ or .
&quot; in this , the first def@@ endants he did not agree with this form@@ ulation , because the club has never been a damage . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the law@@ yer says , &quot; &quot; With whom you are all from the tail@@ or . &quot;
&quot; am I a legal ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the functional , he has never been related to a p@@ enny content , it is only od@@ ometer and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; on di@@ ets , he made the club 1000 euro per month , however , the actual expense was however much higher , he added . &quot;
precise documents for the early years could not make the acc@@ used .
&quot; these are after a inspection , in which everything was judged as correct , no longer told them . &quot;
od@@ ometer was also the second acc@@ used .
&quot; all per@@ cep@@ tions were carried out in cash , in addition , he must have to go from his residence of the international market to the Bank to Blei@@ burg , he explained in his statement . &quot;
the main trial will be continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .

time of decision on interest rates for the US notation
&quot; the world is observed if the US @-@ Not@@ ch has two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to meet the important decision whether for the first time has been raised for almost a decade or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey of 80 econom@@ ists caused by Reu@@ ters , found out that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed is still somewhat longer consu@@ ming and the interest rates on the current state of 0 - 0,@@ 25 per cent will be kept . &quot;
&quot; it is a historical event , because it has seven years since the F@@ ed interest is set to NU@@ LL . &quot;
&quot; for the first time we approach the situation , in which a major central bank may cancel the zero @-@ area and start a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ de , leading employees at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is on a relatively good performance , billi@@ ons dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate just a small inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ro@@ bust@@ ous view of global circumstances . &quot;
&quot; it has war@@ ned the markets to raise to an increase , but the signs refer to that the chances of such a step is good . &quot;
the decision should be announced at 20.00 Uhr CET on Thursday

&quot; the president William La@@ For@@ ge said he kn@@ ow@@ ed nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something into Mr Lam@@ bs conception . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb had said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also felt a relationship with the authorities on Tuesday , there was no information , no evidence &quot; &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was taken by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said that she had been married about seven years , than a &quot; good man . &quot; &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United may not play a monthly failure for double frei@@ ght
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double Fra@@ ktur with Manchester at PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven won a double Fra@@ ktur of his right leg .
&quot; while this left the left foreign to t@@ ears , and gave it out for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al will not give hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a consider@@ ate attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno after the 20 year after the 20 year of old Sha@@ w in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the playing field and had requested oxygen before going to hospital .
Van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double leg and is located at the hospital . &quot;
he will be transferred tomorrow or maybe a day later and then generates in Manchester .
&quot; it is terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United Kingdom , it is very difficult and then fantastic playing , and then it happens . &quot;
in the changing rooms he had a tri@@ umph .
he w@@ ept .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double Fra@@ ktur , then it takes six months , and he will not play in group phase . &quot;
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a Red card and the suspension of an El@@ f@@ meters .
&quot; Nicol@@ a Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arb@@ iter , has not pun@@ ished the mex@@ ican . &quot;
Van Ga@@ al susp@@ ected that the Italian arb@@ iter had ambi@@ valent .
they can judge for themselves when I say that a mo@@ l and a red card .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; a tweet to Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how I am cap@@ turing me , my path to recovery begins now , I get stronger back again . &quot;
related to : Manchester United facilit@@ ates the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the defeat at PS@@ V
the England Def@@ ender has an additional incen@@ tive with the enlargement of Europe until the coming June .
&quot; Philip Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; &quot; it is a very serious injury . &quot;
if a player leaves the place with this kind of injury to the place they are all very sad about it .
&quot; it is never the intention of our players , to hurt an opponent . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ eno suffered a leg , when Mexico was played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the World Championship 2014 . &quot;
&quot; he is very difficult , because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you heard that it is a very serious injury , this is not good , &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball , which was in a different direction so it looked , as if he had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; talking to S@@ BS@@ 6 said Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard to be something like that . &quot;
I feel very bad@@ ly there . I am so sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ game of Chris Sm@@ all@@ ing .
certainly David Cameron The Lor@@ ax knows better ?
&quot; it is a matter who will learn all parents soon : if your child does a book , it will not take long until you know it almost anything . &quot;
&quot; unless , you may be David Cameron . &quot;
&quot; as he was asked by a supplier of child care systems , his favorite child &apos;s book was decided , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the 1971 published en@@ vironment@@ alist of Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , Cameron in a message writes on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to submit my children , because it seems to be a picture or a message that we have so far missed . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and well , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron was supp@@ os@@ edly discussed the action of the book , instead a advertis@@ ed of the movie version of 2012 will be added to expand the new characters and details in order to extend the fairly brief original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , who was his desire to see a real tree , whose genuine name Theod@@ or Se@@ uss Ab@@ sel lau@@ ght@@ ered and the 1991 died , but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if this has not been won &apos;t enough : the lyrics by Cameron was presented like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is made available on the website of Internet Movie Database , where everything is arti@@ ficial and even the air is a commodity , hop@@ ing a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he is confident to be a pr@@ ag@@ matic father , it seems invisible , as the local environment is so little familiar . here list@@ ens the action of the book so little familiar . here list@@ ens the action of the nam@@ ing Lor@@ ax , a dist@@ ress , cor@@ rupt beings , &quot; that is in the name of the trees . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR @-@ task was deleg@@ ated to an hel@@ per who had read The Lor@@ ax not 20 times in a child . &quot;
&quot; a down@@ ing @-@ street speaking , the text probably came by Camer@@ ons constitu@@ tive office . &quot;
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text of Camer@@ ons employees was delivered , but there were no other direct comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened with the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still hard . &quot;
&quot; across Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , is a difficult task , but if one has chosen the cad@@ re that has chosen the England for the tour , is a repeti@@ tion of the 3 @-@ 0 test series @-@ defeat is not on my map . &quot;
I would not close an aw@@ ay@@ bridge .
&quot; Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks site may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the batt@@ ing recording , and the school spirit is strong ; they will not wear scar@@ ring of 2012 , just a youth@@ ful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; the ball developed Mo@@ een Ali as a spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown number on test layer , is an option for attack . &quot;
&quot; following message : Adam Ly@@ th , from the England @-@ Test @-@ K@@ ader and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales . &quot;
&quot; a decision to sett@@ le Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his che@@ ek@@ machine in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analy@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; at its seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ cket@@ l are oriented on results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark on Joe R@@ oot , for example , and this led to the nom@@ ination , since - and I have told this - players are their own best cul@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; a long time ago , one could have extended the course of poetry , but he had control over his own destiny . &quot;
if he will hopefully bring further sales for Yor@@ k@@ shire has another chance .
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss pra@@ ised his attitude , even if he did not so good performances , and that don &apos;t surprised me ; he is above all a team @-@ guy . &quot;
the question how much time a test stroke gets to be his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton nine got .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance of home@@ coming and play@@ back .
the only sound &apos;s throw which one can rise was that England was first Jonathan Tr@@ ott in the Caribbean - but this lost opportunity is now in the past .
alex H@@ ales comes up and he is a stroke that I set high .
&quot; he is an X factor @-@ Cri@@ min@@ alist player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire in this season , when he scor@@ ed 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge Square , which was us very met . &quot;
&quot; he must receive at least the same opportunities as those before him , but this depends on the teams creation in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to beat Mo@@ een beside C@@ ook , which would bring an extra @-@ spin of the Bow@@ ler and four qu@@ icks , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I do not see why a dru@@ man cannot hit there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a devil of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een has not done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my early te@@ amm@@ ate Jus@@ tin L@@ anger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before it occurred in 2001 as Open@@ er .
he has made a three hundred rings immediately and did not look back .
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ re as Back @-@ up sp@@ inners , and in my limited use he has impressed me as a young man . &quot;
people may see his statistics on - average 31 with the rack@@ et and 35 with the ball - and think it is a p@@ unt but there is no large number of Backup co@@ ders who raise their hands and the co@@ aches have chosen himself for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has made a few clever ad@@ ditions to the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ den@@ e , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test@@ games could be a master@@ co@@ up . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est ker@@ le of the game , which will bring an abund@@ ance of experience as he has played under all the conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball @-@ phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful employment into the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as Coach , and as Mah@@ ela , he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the changing rooms , even if the messages in line with the previously mess@@ engers are standing . &quot;
&quot; Coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ ok@@ es , is not used in the One @-@ Day@@ gers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I for my part I have no problem with it . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but Co@@ aches and Team@@ watch will not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you must remember that like with players depend on their jobs from the results .
such decisions will not be easy to use .

&quot; in Bright@@ on , the TU@@ C chose the Annual General Meeting that it may not like this , when they risk the social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges L@@ fie @-@ Agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Finance Minist@@ ers climb towards summit meeting or bilater@@ al meetings in foreign capit@@ als , make a photo of yourself from a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they are allies for reforms . &quot;

&quot; it falls heav@@ ily to consider that it should be a leg to help the Sel@@ fie @-@ British to help their energy better to be used , Scotland &apos;s res@@ ign@@ ite from the UK - something that they do not want , because most of them have similar altern@@ ating tend@@ encies . &quot;

&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ otiation of the &quot; &quot; UK &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Great Britain has gained a lot of value from the ren@@ eg@@ otiation . &quot;
&quot; the Europeans know how idi@@ otic the Fle@@ et Street may be at their expense and which EU sc@@ ep@@ tics , the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press , as they were not inspired by Tony Ben@@ n insp@@ ected refer@@ en@@ du@@ ms 1975 but not that our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 supported . &quot;

&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans as Bl@@ air himself , as he had ref@@ used Camer@@ ons Spe@@ en@@ du@@ ms@@ n@@ bel , because Bl@@ air had rej@@ ected the principle concerning the unknown Constitution of the EU , which was then rej@@ ected by French and Dutch cloth@@ s in 2005 that was opened to him with a door . &quot;

&quot; it may take , but he must develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to gain the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa has left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns official position on Europe - I have been making it friendly - in development .
he says that we should remain in a reform@@ ist EU .
&quot; now , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps &apos;s traditional bubble t@@ endency and the wil@@ der ge@@ fil@@ den of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can probably say anything of them . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV this week said that Cor@@ by@@ ns was strug@@ gling in him , not ad@@ mit that Cor@@ by@@ ns appointment of the pro@@ vo@@ ic@@ ating John Mc@@ Don@@ nell as Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ anz@@ ler was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; he rem@@ ind@@ ed me of the 70 &apos;s years , when his old father is celeb@@ rit@@ ed , il@@ loy@@ al to his Labour cabinet , without going to go too far and lose his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys struggle was more attractive .
&quot; but to fight , in order to remain &quot; under all circumstances - Benn@@ &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ nell said , even what J@@ C told his fellow artists and members according to all reports on their cl@@ it@@ day on Monday . &quot;
&quot; whatever the tou@@ ching Bot@@ t@@ om @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n will give - remember that he even keeps me stir@@ red - news discipline remains essential and above all things in the ma@@ el@@ strom of soci@@ etal media , a gross venue of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ y@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it is correct to give Cameron no free card for Europe who allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the refer@@ en@@ du@@ m@@ sk@@ amp@@ agne to maintain an in@@ comprehen@@ sibility of how Mc@@ Don@@ nell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks for sure .
&quot; but Mc@@ Don@@ nell and Cor@@ by@@ ns basic am@@ big@@ u@@ ities in line with their Benn@@ ite Bel@@ ager@@ ungs @-@ economy , its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion under the left dis@@ si@@ dents that is a central principle of dog@@ matic disp@@ utes . &quot;
&quot; as with its am@@ big@@ u@@ ities , N@@ ato - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C will not start campaign to res@@ ign@@ ation , foreign diplom@@ ats will be oblig@@ ed to try to find in all a sense of their reservation at home . &quot;

experts cri@@ tic@@ ise report by Public Health England via e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; asser@@ tions of a state financial agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking emerg@@ ed from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tob@@ acco @-@ industry , they said . &quot;
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ j ) comm@@ it@@ ments by sending the Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report about e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; he published the &quot; &quot; principle &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have raised the load@@ ability of the data and directed towards the connections between some experts and the tob@@ acco @-@ industry . &quot;
&quot; a Editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month att@@ acked the &quot; extraordinary &quot; wind@@ y basis &quot; , &quot; on the p@@ he the most important conclusion . &quot;
&quot; two more researchers write in BM@@ G and asked whether the claim &quot; &quot; can be based on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ ewell , Professor of Clinical Epid@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the evidence of the effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public expects that the asser@@ tion of P@@ he that &quot; &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes about 95 % less harmful are based as smoking &quot; on a detailed review of after@@ care and mod@@ elling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 persons who were introduced to develop a model for multi@@ purpose @-@ criteria @-@ decision @-@ analysis ( Multi @-@ Criteria Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to bring their opinions regarding the damage of various nic@@ otine @-@ containing products to a synthesis . the results of the meeting have been summ@@ ar@@ ised in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ ewell said that a spons@@ or of the meeting is a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing directors was previously received by British American Tobacco funds ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
he under@@ has also wrote the references of BA@@ T to the Public Health in a Sustainability Report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants stated in the meeting , to obtain funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes producer , but not financing that he should have received after reports before the tob@@ acco company Philip Morris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for the selection of members of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums are not delivered , but these include several known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes feature , some of which are also specify a branch of industries in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tob@@ ac@@ control .
at the session also took the tob@@ acco @-@ direction of P@@ he .
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; blow@@ ing &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of hard evidence of the damages of most products in most criteria , written by Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ ewell . &quot;
&quot; however , no these links or restrictions will be discussed in the P@@ he report . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ ewell said that the asser@@ tions of P@@ he that there is so far no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes is used as a path to smoking for children or non @-@ smoking .
&quot; prof Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well@@ being at P@@ he said that the claims of BM@@ j has previously been respon@@ sive . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his ad@@ diction .
&quot; all evidence at@@ tach that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes compared to low are low , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term impact . &quot;
&quot; he has the clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence was occupied and what is not , especially when there is so much public confusion over the relative dangers of compared to tob@@ acco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 80@@ .000 men die annually in a disease with regard to smoking , and smoking costs the national health care period two billion € per year . &quot;
&quot; by clear pre@@ cip@@ itation of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fr@@ action of the damage caused by smoking , we meet our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC should first enter the East@@ Du@@ ders , says former Chief of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former chair of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said the BBC should stop to send programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals &apos; could give her right arm &quot; for Hit @-@ shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the radio fee is to be used only to make the type of programs , which are not sent by other UK transm@@ itter . &quot;
&quot; he cri@@ tici@@ zed the BBC for ensuring that it will probably be seen in public @-@ legal programs , which probably could be seen from a smaller audience to place the most popular shows of its ri@@ vals and Sen@@ ales like BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC @-@ General Director , Tony Hall , said , the company would like to do more in partnership with other organizations , said Johnson that he tried out six years at Channel 4 without success with the BBC in contact . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are on order or sends out which were clearly shown by not subsidi@@ fied ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson the Ober@@ haus @-@ communications Committee under his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the radio fee , what I mean or do not mean for a good idea , one should do at least on programs , the others do not do or on behalf . &quot;
&quot; they are sending The Voice in a first class window , because they want to achieve a broad variety of support for their future . &quot;
&quot; the idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke , it is ri@@ dic@@ ulous ; it is natural non@@ sense . &quot;
Johnson said : &quot; I do not see why a reg@@ res@@ sive control programs will also be financed without sub@@ si@@ dies .
&quot; the Voice is one such program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions . &quot;
hon@@ est@@ ly speaking other channels would give your right arm for it .
I am trying to see how this is public@@ ly to be public@@ ly television .
I don &apos;t think that this would be the BBC at all .
&quot; Johnson , an entre@@ pren@@ eur for series who was introduc@@ ing Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC t@@ ame for reviews was &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to ensure long term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular ship@@ ments of the BBC give this again , what was the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows how East@@ En@@ ders should sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the more public@@ ly @-@ legal Web @-@ programs should go to BB@@ C4 , but they do not perform their tasks , and they can arg@@ um@@ ed when they have created their own sacred missions to justi@@ fy 4 billi@@ ons of £ sl@@ aves , &quot; &quot; Well , natural , we have seen all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them into a timer in which nobody ever wanted to see them .
at the radio channel I said Johnson the Committee : &quot; I ur@@ ge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system regarding conditions to obtain the best value here .
&quot; of course , you think of course , we all think that you get a lot of money for 150 £ per year here , but for people who vote for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask myself whether this is true , because they consu@@ me not much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 @-@ Chef David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission to check and keep up to date and enter@@ tained . &quot;
&quot; he said , just little of the BBC @-@ production now officially classified as education - he said that there is 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in the radio and they should change one example in the public@@ ly @-@ legal television stations in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; to the question of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful on television turned out to make everything online available . &quot;

&quot; researchers said the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new procedure called Son@@ hal@@ etics , can be used in ultr@@ as@@ ound , to enable a range of brain , cardi@@ ac and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian , that the procedure of one day could replace the dep@@ ths of brain cancer , an inv@@ asive procedure , the electrical stimul@@ i in the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; du@@ b@@ wor@@ ms generally does not respond to ultr@@ as@@ ound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani turned out that they were used when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ s@@ copic bu@@ b@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bu@@ b@@ bles , he found out , strengthen the ultr@@ as@@ ound @-@ waves , which then enter into the wor@@ ms . &quot;
the rein@@ forced ultr@@ as@@ ound switches are based on structures that are called the TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and within the membran@@ es of some of the cu@@ es cells .
&quot; the sound @-@ waves provide the opening of this icons , and activate the cells that they are assigned to such a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; to create ultr@@ as@@ ound ref@@ ato@@ des , alter@@ ed Chal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically the wor@@ ms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ s TR@@ P @-@ 4 channels . &quot;
&quot; when he entered into the alter@@ ed creatures , the sound @-@ waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ blad@@ der and transferred to the wor@@ ms where they turn the changed sl@@ on@@ eur@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ tog@@ en@@ etics , a ground@@ breaking tool , the scienti@@ st allows , neur@@ ons with stimul@@ i of the light and turn off . &quot;
&quot; however , Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ as@@ etics would have some advantages over this technique might have . &quot;

it respon@@ ded to it with even lou@@ der music .
&quot; when they listen@@ ed at 5 o &apos;clock , they left their neighb@@ ours still two hours before they left their own music and beg@@ ging their door and came to their thir@@ sty test . &quot;
would it be not romantic if your future sp@@ ouse would happen to happen in the same Student assistant ?

the real @-@ contrac@@ tor Markus Ther@@ ner builds a lot of money in the medium @-@ edge Eck@@ ental town@@ houses for people who have not much money .
&quot; therefore about for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need residential area , but also the end of the mother and the bar@@ gain . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll show , how to do today still cheap and well build , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview
thousands of refugees are run in the apartment market .
the entre@@ pren@@ eur Markus Ther@@ e@@ er believes in knowing how rapidly cheaper space can be created : it builds in a project of town@@ houses for refugees .
Mr Gild@@ an : many refugees will run away on the apartment market .
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Sch@@ ner : the mass of mass in containers or Turn@@ stone has no sustainability .
because people remain a great part here .
&quot; in the light of the re@@ fuge@@ e camp , we need enough space in the coming decades . &quot;
a very b@@ anal@@ ed and three @-@ story town@@ house is the solution .
Gild@@ an : a town@@ house needs the least place .
it makes it easier .
this is different if you under@@ take the people in a fl@@ akes .
&quot; each of the six houses , which are currently built in the pilot project consisting of three units for four as@@ yl@@ um seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; each apartment has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge . &quot;
&quot; it can be that many refugees are saying , it is again peace , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can be easily re@@ built according to the respective needs .
how high are the cost ?
Gild@@ an : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house is based on 184 000 euros , without plot . &quot;
this is transparent .
six months has penet@@ rated .
this is appropriate .
do the buildings have their plans complicated ?
Gild@@ an : this legally did my project correctly .
&quot; particularly complicated , it is always the threat@@ ening D@@ amo@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ valu@@ ed special structure and location . &quot;
* * * * * *
&quot; it is still ex@@ poses , who creates three apartments in a trav@@ eller house , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in cities is missing the place .
and refugees and as@@ yl@@ um seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the associ@@ ates have respon@@ ded to their real@@ time project ?
Gild@@ an : there was what they have thro@@ wn to me , Lux@@ or built for as@@ yl@@ um seek@@ ers . &quot;
what is definitely not true .
&quot; but , do not miss the ri@@ vals for affordable apartments ? &quot;
&quot; Gild@@ an : true is it : we had a tree @-@ boom in Germany , but built luxury apartments , which can barely afford a more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , as well as normal people need residential . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the mother @-@ out mother or the right@@ eous . &quot;
I &apos;ll show how to invest still cheap and well equipped with them .
that &apos;s why it goes .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS if Apple update will be published
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by clicking on the settings app , click on &quot; General &quot; and then &quot; Software Update . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install . &quot;
&quot; some are bot@@ her@@ ed after the installation to problems as they receive a error message , the wed@@ ge that the &quot; software update is failed &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to deal with the problem , users can be recommended to either wait until the rush will go back or attempt to update over iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself takes you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may possibly make del@@ e@@ tion of apps to create space - but Apple has done this by the intensi@@ fication of updates un@@ likely , so it will be easier to delete it and then re@@ install it as soon as the process is completed . &quot;
it &apos;s worth to ensure that your mobile phone is loaded during up@@ dating or is located near a charger that is loaded until the battery is loaded .
&quot; if the cargo is too low , Apple does not mean that the update will be continued , as the phone may be off at half way , and this could lead to a break@@ through of updates . &quot;

&quot; besides the consult@@ ations , the new bon@@ net office offers also pre@@ vent@@ ing , health care and wellness . &quot;
so the Sal@@ udi@@ s was taken with the boat .
&quot; therefore , you can use additional offers such as over@@ convention , memory , or physi@@ otherap@@ ist treatment . &quot;
the offers of the station centre and the Sal@@ udi@@ s complement each other in an ideal manner .
&quot; Sal@@ udi@@ s stands for prevention , precau@@ tion and re@@ hab . &quot;

Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice Fel@@ ste@@ ausen and invested 310@@ 000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen .
&quot; moreover , Sam@@ e@@ non @-@ deb@@ ited Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic exchange in U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schw@@ art@@ z and As@@ endor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried cab@@ bert . &quot;
in many places in the countryside missing doctors - As@@ endorf against it has good luck : there takes no luck in Dr. Frank Müller on the 1st of October .
&quot; during Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ic@@ ausen comes into retirement , her husband is Karl @-@ Heinrich his successor to the next months still with half a place to the page . &quot;
&quot; after a reconstruction phase Müller opened the practice on 12 October , until then he invested 310@@ 000 Euro in the premises at St.@@ -@@ Marc@@ ell@@ us@@ strasse 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy over the first glance , when the rims directly got to know Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who currently holds its experts in the late hospital and will also join in practice . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the g@@ arb@@ age would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen and laugh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; when it was far as far , I was just inv@@ oked . &quot;
&quot; the couple liked the idea , in the future to operate the own practice , in the future . &quot;
&quot; the proximity and constant contact to the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we want to get to know the families over the years , and accompany . &quot;
&quot; as an advantage he also see , soon his own b@@ oss . &quot;
and so one became one who bought the house &apos;s house with practice .
they will continue to stay in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ z .
&quot; the second family @-@ grand@@ father Frank Müller has grown up , his medical inst@@ inc@@ t in Hanover , followed , as well as in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; currently he is active as Ober@@ atri@@ cian in Sul@@ ingen , he was also appointed as conduc@@ ting Not@@ ter in the circle Di@@ ep@@ holz , and is engaged in the DRC @-@ willingness fr@@ ill @-@ willingness fr@@ action . &quot;
from September 19th the practice will be prepared for the new b@@ oss .
&quot; during the sur@@ ge@@ on Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ste@@ ausen is working as domestic , his sp@@ ouse has speci@@ alised in the gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the g@@ arb@@ age , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to sett@@ le as home@@ opathy . &quot;
&quot; End@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll . &quot;
after the re@@ building the rooms are modern look .
we will offer more ultr@@ as@@ ound exam@@ inations as well as long @-@ term and loads EK@@ GS and need a bit more .
furthermore the ED@@ V will be completely renewed .
&quot; a grant from a total of 500@@ 00 Euro , the Mü@@ ll@@ ers get within the framework of a convey@@ or programme ( 25@@ ,000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is proce@@ eded , &quot; says Sam@@ t@@ non @-@ deb@@ ger@@ meister Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
about 2000 patients are coming according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll every quarter into practice Fel@@ it@@ ausen in the north @-@ German Average study are about 500 .
in As@@ endorf there is another hous@@ arz@@ t@@ prax@@ is .
a positive side effect of the res@@ e@@ over by Frank Müller : the ph@@ armacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
if no successor would have been found it would have been gone .
&quot; he is also visiting himself , he continues to look forward in familiar faces : assu@@ mes the seven medical professionals and the cleaning of the rock . &quot;
&quot; with their far@@ ewell ends in As@@ endorf an era , after all , the media has been practic@@ ed 30 years there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen and smiling . &quot;
a little thr@@ ust consu@@ me after the long time already .
&quot; but we still live in Hoh@@ en@@ mo@@ or , and many patients will certainly see them often , &quot; says the Intern@@ ist . &quot;
her husband are comp@@ lem@@ ented : &quot; we have a 6000 square metres @-@ plot . &quot;
&quot; so far I have always pressed before gardening , now it could be different . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the couple has two grand@@ children and trav@@ els . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot;
&quot; now the border contro@@ versi@@ es also went to our South @-@ border &quot; , &quot; said the Minister of Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain stable in parallel .
&quot; as before it is clear that everyone who want to place an eighth position , that is also &quot; &quot; of course &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of people stand in the for@@ eg@@ round .
&quot; but it is clear that there are clear signals , &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; people must know that we do not accept inj@@ less migration flows , neither on the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia are considering &quot; cor@@ rid@@ or &quot; - Slovenia den@@ ied
the Croatian government had previously closed , also Slovenia leads to refugees refugees in direction Austria and Germany and also address cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees to refugees . &quot;
he did not see the Prime Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach .
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors &quot; be absolutely un@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia , the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary - intensi@@ fied . &quot;
the border with Croatia was very much controlled by the Sch@@ engen area .
&quot; as the minist@@ ers st@@ ressed , Slovenia has its borders for refugees but not leaving . &quot;
&quot; every EU member needs to fill its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; st@@ ressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government , the first refugees were already tried in the night hours on Tuesday , in Ost@@ Croatian border on the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d passed over to develop the registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could take it into the near Ma@@ is@@ fel@@ dern .
according to local media have ever been playing in Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik constantly Polish cars with new refugees .
&quot; it is primarily for Syri@@ ans and Af@@ gh@@ ans , including many women and children . &quot;
even in @-@ house services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the days ahead , his country will be charged with around 4000 refugees , said Li@@ anko R@@ anko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; additionally , buses from Pres@@ evo at the ma@@ z@@ ed@@ on@@ ically @-@ Ser@@ bian border that were previously sent migrants to the Hungarian border , towards Croatia reported Croatian and Ser@@ bian media on Wednesday co@@ inci@@ des . &quot;
&quot; however , the government in Bel@@ grade , however , it may be the people to address certain routes : &quot; neither can we do , nor do we want to do this , &quot; which was called it . &quot;
&quot; according to the media report , in the morning a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Ser@@ bian border town of Si@@ D , in the course of the day further buses were waiting . &quot;
&quot; about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were the whole night from the approximately 500 kilometres distant ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian border with Serbia on the road .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has made us that Hungary has said to us that we are supposed to drive this here , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany . &quot;
&quot; hence , it could actually be predic@@ ted for ob@@ server deport@@ ees to the previous Balkans route of Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west route . &quot;
&quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; comprehensive options to work &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Croatian Minister of O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously st@@ ressed out that his country for the case of a strong hum@@ ili@@ ation of refugees have prepared according to potential excep@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; if he did not know , but he pointed out that Croatia was as a non @-@ Sch@@ engen member &quot; &quot; extensive opportunity to control the border control . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the strict controls performed , to quali@@ fy for membership in the Sch@@ engen area . &quot;
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU @-@ partner to face a good testimony that concerns the standard of the border contro@@ vers@@ y . &quot;
on the left side of the Hungarian Gren@@ zz@@ au@@ n River continue to move about 300 refugees .
&quot; according to Bel@@ grade media reports , they would have spent the past night at the border crossing H@@ org@@ os that leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
according to the details of the Hungarian authorities the two border cross@@ ings H@@ org@@ os and Back@@ i Bre@@ g is still completely block@@ ed .
&quot; whether the remaining refugees should now continue to travel to Croatian border , is still un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; the ser@@ b@@ ische Secretary of N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic was trying to so@@ othing the deb@@ ates in H@@ org@@ os , when the deb@@ ates about altern@@ ativ@@ ly gro@@ oves of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , early as early as early . &quot;
it would not be a very high re@@ fuge@@ e experience .
&quot; you could not say whether they would continue their journey over Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers of migrants at - dangerous - alternative gro@@ oves
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugees has already begun to distri@@ bute the refugees of maps showing the alternative routes through Croatia . &quot;
&quot; but the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harm@@ less : in parts of the border area , there is also 20 years after the rest of the Croatian train . &quot;
in the afternoon the Croatian police were announced that a team of minorities has been sent to the border region .

&quot; while I att@@ ing a passenger spont@@ aneously to rot@@ ating and the pro@@ position around &quot; &quot; my life &quot; &quot; to stop &quot; &quot; to stop war &quot; , &quot; to stop the war &quot; or &quot; not long , &quot; read the sent@@ ences like &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; and then go on . &quot;
&quot; again and again on the edge of small discussions about the promotion , about life , dealing with dying . &quot;
also Peter Hü@@ b@@ inger is just on site .
&quot; only when I clearly make it clear that for me at the end of this world , I can live responsible , &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onischen Werk@@ es Mannheim , which is jointly owned by Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband der Ö@@ k@@ umen@@ ical Hosp@@ iz@@ z . &quot;
therefore this public effective action to be achieved in the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; however , that not everyone wants to be public on the table , but ultimately understand@@ able , finally , it was a very personal thing . &quot;
&quot; the subject of death and mort@@ als , as before with tab@@ oos , the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , who have contributed much to the aim of the Hosp@@ iz@@ ine movement in recent years that people will open up the people . &quot;
a assessment that is shares by Angel@@ ika Go@@ de@@ fro@@ id .
the Dying and ob@@ ress belongs to the voluntary employees of the first hour .
&quot; by personal image con@@ fron@@ ted with the theme , read it a lot of literature and decided to engage in eu@@ than@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ iz@@ re took care of hon@@ orary Doc@@ atten@@ tions , they have immediately reported it and be in the founding in 1995 . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ de@@ fro@@ id belongs to a team of 45 volunte@@ ers - 43 women and two men - those affected by private homes , hospitals , nur@@ sing homes , nur@@ sing homes and in hosp@@ ice Saint Vincent . &quot;
all of them are carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ de@@ fro@@ id can deal with her mission and to deal with experiences and experiences .
&quot; I see life from another war@@ te , keeping it for precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; says it . &quot;
the offer of the ambul@@ atory ec@@ umen@@ ical Hosp@@ es Team is free and den@@ omin@@ ation@@ ally dependent .
the financial support of the health and donations of relatives and organis@@ ational perm@@ its the training as well as training and super@@ vis@@ ons of the Dying and ob@@ hut .

&quot; the tablets described on Saturday and are now displayed in the house of the Protest@@ ant church ( M1 , 1a ) , and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F2 , 6 ) . &quot;
&quot; also , there can be additional personal wishes on post@@ cards . &quot;
F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , fin@@ s out@@ look for 2016 &quot;
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appointments results for the last quarter , and the C@@ SG Gig@@ ant lo@@ wer@@ ed his prize for a whole year because of the weak@@ est demand for frei@@ ght services and higher costs in his soil transport service . &quot;
&quot; the company also said that she is planning to ack@@ n@@ owledge about 55@@ ,000 season workers for the holiday . &quot;
&quot; at this time last year F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company expects to set the company 5@@ 0,000 season workers . &quot;
the shares fell on 2.5 per cent in the pre @-@ market trading a 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a gain between 10,@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in fis@@ cal year , ending in the next May , 20 c@@ ents less than in the previous predic@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; analy@@ sts exp@@ elled according to a survey of Fact@@ set 10,@@ 84 $ . &quot;
&quot; the less@@ er view comes in spite of the price increases , an average of 4.9 percent will be effective and in spite of higher attri@@ butes for soil transport of heavy and large packages that will be raised from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said that it is nevertheless exp@@ ecting the result in comparison to the previous year due to cost , higher earnings and due to growth in the online trade . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company brings the &quot; solid sub@@ missions to consider the we@@ aker as expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; plans for the holidays of employment were announced a day later than those of the Rival UPS have announced , 90@@ .000 to 95@@ .000 additional labour forces , approximately the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , ended on 31 August ended F@@ ed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million $ , 6 percent more than last year . &quot;
&quot; the earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2,@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve by Z@@ acks Investment Research requested analy@@ sts predic@@ ted . &quot;
sales rose by 5 percent to 12,@@ 3 billion $ .
six of h@@ acks requested analy@@ sts expected 12.@@ 23 billion $ .
F@@ ed@@ Ex has a decl@@ ine at the international priorities in the last few years which brought its sales in its unity Express shipping .
but the boom in online @-@ shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex ground .
&quot; in the last quarter , sales of the ground transport increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the Express @-@ unit sub@@ mer@@ ged higher earnings because of higher prices , while the result because of higher labor market in frei@@ ght shop s@@ ank . &quot;
&quot; in the pre @-@ market trading , approximately one hour before the opening , for@@ ks the F@@ ed@@ Ex stock around 3,@@ 85 $ , or 2,5 per cent , on 15@@ 0.@@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , with 11 per cent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on 11 June . &quot;
&quot; at their most expected meeting in the year Federal Reserve Strateg@@ en spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ Mah@@ ag@@ oni table , to decide whether it is time for the first time since almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; threat@@ ening about them at the end of the completed , two @-@ stor@@ ey@@ ed seat sa@@ il is a wall screen of the United States . &quot;
the map is a remin@@ der that the F@@ ed @-@ Chair Jan@@ et L. y@@ ellen and their colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all the other things .
the central bank has provided a two @-@ fold contract by the Congress : Maximi@@ lian of the US @-@ Employment and prices here stable .
&quot; but since the major rec@@ ession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognized that there is an un@@ favor@@ able man@@ date man@@ date : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; this third man@@ date could be the X factor in a decision which is too tight for them to predic@@ t them . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to become bitter about the un@@ prec@@ ed@@ ented incen@@ tive since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most of the data of the economy show that it grows solid , the recent tur@@ bul@@ ences could boost the most recent tur@@ bul@@ es in the global financial markets , to rein@@ force these vol@@ atil@@ ity by the ab@@ olition of the tent for federal government - and be it only a quarter of a quarter . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation in primarily be the most important thing they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Ch@@ ef@@ ull@@ in at the m@@ ler company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think when looking for a pre@@ text , the interest rate was not to raise , the increased in@@ security around the global market enough justi@@ fication , continue to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
there is no con@@ sen@@ sus on what the F@@ ed is done , what is in@@ sured by itself the financial market . &quot;
&quot; about half of the econom@@ ists , which were recently asked from Bloom@@ berg , have prev@@ ail@@ ed this week predic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; however , financial markets expect a query , with a key indi@@ ces , which is only a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decl@@ ine in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the Strateg@@ ic can susp@@ ect the blow by doing so that another increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday jump@@ ed the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average value at 228@@ ,@@ 89 points or at 1.4 % at 16.@@ 5@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the promotion was trig@@ ger@@ ed by expectations that the F@@ ed policy consi@@ ders the sentence of this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Ch@@ ef@@ ö@@ kon@@ om at M@@ oody &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sent@@ ences at this time , he said . &quot;
&quot; if they do it , they would have to go very far in their explanation to so@@ othing the financial markets , so that it is not in panic . &quot;
&quot; other experts arg@@ um@@ ed that a publi@@ city would make so@@ othing the financial markets , because they would be the un@@ certainty about when the F@@ ed will act . &quot;
&quot; a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared to increase the sentence by 0,@@ 25 percentage points in this month , the first small step in a long shar@@ pen@@ ing of the mon@@ et@@ ary conditions that would be the strength of recovery in the U.S. . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in the spring and in early summer they said this year despite the complaints of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be required , an increase in the pro@@ position . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs in August demand@@ ed , the improvement due to the labour market this year was solid . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate increases to 5.3 % last month , the low@@ est for more than seven years and within the level of the levels , which sees the F@@ ed as full employment . &quot;
pay@@ roll have signs of recovery .
&quot; and although inflation is constantly going under the name goal of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason the temporary effect of considerably lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can cope higher interest rates and needs it because of the tension in the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ epher@@ d@@ son , Ch@@ ef@@ ö@@ kon@@ om at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot;
&quot; but the financial markets around the world gathered together at the end of the last month , after China had its currency . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ ow Jones Industrial aver@@ se fell in May around more than 16 % among his peak , as investors fear@@ ed that a slow@@ ing of the Chinese economy would under@@ go over the global growth of drug . &quot;
&quot; the market has a bit relaxing in this month , whereby the D@@ ow is now about 10 % below the tes@@ k of May . &quot;
for the F@@ ed Repres@@ ent@@ atives influence the market tur@@ bul@@ ences of the complex col@@ oring when to raise the interest .
&quot; if the events occur in the financial markets and the news on the weak@@ ness of Chinese econom@@ ies were not occurred during this session , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Cin@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the US . &quot;
&quot; now , he pres@@ upp@@ oses that they are waiting at least one month to get the impact better in the grip . &quot;
&quot; there are a lot of un@@ certainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy , and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is none of the main focus of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in their decision @-@ making . &quot;
but in the end of the end the F@@ ed monetary authorities have become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
&quot; the mere statement of the then suffering Ben S. Bern@@ anke in the year 2013 that the F@@ ed is its mon@@ et@@ ary expansion &quot; &quot; narrow &quot; &quot; con@@ fer@@ ries round about the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and econom@@ ies are increasingly im@@ per@@ ed , from the F@@ ed representatives can be monitor@@ ed by the F@@ ed representative , but also with other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; his decision making &quot; more art as science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ate , head of the global strategy for the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month , that &quot; the F@@ ed has a story of over@@ re@@ mn@@ ments on financial market movements are linked to the economic fundament@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; L@@ acker , un@@ author@@ ised Member of the Federal Open Market Committee , based on advertising , deci@@ ding decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce their gui@@ del@@ ine by 0.75 percent@@ ages in three sessions &quot; &quot; despite limited recogni@@ z@@ able impact on growth in the US &quot; , &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed Repres@@ ent@@ atives made these cuts .
&quot; the F@@ ed should focus aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the land@@ mark in 2008 , &quot; said Adam S. Poz@@ nan , former Member of the Committee on the accession of the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the latest tur@@ bul@@ ences come not in the proximity of this plane , he said . &quot;
&quot; it certainly does not want to get into the situation in which it is afraid of a advertising , because the markets see himself , &quot; said Poz@@ nan , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double man@@ date and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is alter@@ ed , I don &apos;t think they should have the time . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ shilfe for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany .
&quot; to give you a warm welcome , not without the commitment of infinite pers . &quot;
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a lot of people who support un@@ sel@@ y as@@ yl@@ um seek@@ ers in the city .
among them Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is with body and soul teacher .
they still taught them with their 74 locations .
every Thursday she does it in the as@@ yl@@ um seek@@ ers on D@@ ill@@ inger street .
&quot; it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan , to learn the German language . &quot;

Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ atric society Rio Grande promotes food for healthy breast@@ feeding
&quot; Brazi@@ lian pa@@ edi@@ atric organization spr@@ inkl@@ es tries to clari@@ fy in sho@@ cking ways of women on how important good diet is made during the lact@@ ation period . it does so with the presentation of pictures of babies , who are made up with portra@@ y@@ als of un@@ healthy food . &quot;
&quot; mother &apos;s milk is made up of a variety of proteins , f@@ ats , vitamins , and carbohydrates , the babies need all nutrients they need to establish a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young m@@ others are taken to increase their daily calcium intake , around 500 cal@@ ories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only di@@ al adaptation to the m@@ others . &quot;
&quot; a current study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ ine College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet was pregnant women in fact and protects the gen@@ es of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ors . &quot;
unfortunately an un@@ healthy diet of the child cannot influence the immune system .
excep@@ tions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Sp@@ orth@@ alle
the council of Bern@@ ried approved the conductor to the 2.3 million Euros of te@@ ar por@@ es .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ acher for solar @-@ system .
the plann@@ ers for the long @-@ train@@ ee train@@ simul@@ ator at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ artikel will be step by step forward : in the recent communities who worked subsequently into a major discussions with no major discussions .
&quot; previously , the Advisory Board had another application for an advanced &quot; exception &quot; &quot; resp@@ ecting &quot; &quot; resp@@ ecting &quot; &quot; of valid Beb@@ ding plan . &quot;
&quot; with the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; we went to the permission for a special form regarding the roof . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a &quot; &quot; addle @-@ lid is &quot; &quot; to be built with non @-@ con@@ ical first and roof level . &quot;
&quot; background of the planning is the planned use of the roof aper@@ ture for solar systems : &quot; &quot; therefore , we get a wonderful big Süd@@ west@@ ach , said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the session . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; liber@@ ation &quot; it went in turn around the at@@ tic , which should be held from energe@@ tic reasons - other than in the Py@@ au@@ ght Action - below ten degrees . &quot;
the volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; liber@@ ation &quot; &quot; is therefore necessary because the cultivation plan no &quot; excep@@ tions &quot; per@@ mis@@ sible - whereby the amber acts tend to be a restric@@ tive disp@@ enser . &quot;
&quot; it is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; &quot; we do not create a prec@@ ed@@ ence &quot; , &quot; so St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;

Klinik P@@ ei@@ ding@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ kk@@ berg is planned to be planned earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed new doctor &apos;s director at the hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station as well as the majority of employees are pul@@ led by P@@ ei@@ met@@ berg with Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; this shows the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the district , the land@@ lord Andrea Jo@@ chner @-@ White confirmed . &quot;
&quot; but a decision on which is the Super@@ visory Board , and the acc@@ ents of the next Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; if the plans are implemented , then all of the nearly 50 employees would continue to pass on the hospital in P@@ ei@@ mi berg . &quot;
move the vast majority of sol@@ le with fisher@@ men and the other existing station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are present .
&quot; the employees that cannot be offered with Sch@@ ong@@ au , is expected to be a job in W@@ eil@@ heim , such as Jo@@ chner . &quot;
the staff were informed about their plans .
trig@@ ger@@ ed the ren@@ unci@@ ation of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been the director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic , and now to a private practice is in direct proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; the question of who is to enter the follow @-@ up , according to Jo@@ chner , the name &quot; fisher@@ men &quot; in the game , who declared himself , starting from 1 October the leadership and to change with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; this is ordered for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this in any case a &quot; &quot; appreci@@ ation &quot; &quot; and a den@@ ing of the offer in the area &quot; &quot; inside medicine &quot; , &quot; says Jo@@ chner . &quot;
fisher@@ men is a specialist for Pac@@ emaker and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in the inner station on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
&quot; tempor@@ arily for the next two years he is supposed to introduce fisher@@ men with his team , when the Super@@ visory board ship , both houses leading up over 35 beds , which is still under 35 beds in P@@ ei@@ rig@@ berg after nearly 140 years . &quot;
&quot; so far , the land@@ kreis had planned this for 2018 , when the current renovation at the Hospital of W@@ eil@@ heim . &quot;
&quot; Jo@@ chner , Jo@@ chner , who is also against the Chairman of the Super@@ visory Board , he met the house that is owned by the Federal State , in future as an accommodation for as@@ yl@@ um web@@ s . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s I close &quot; . &quot; as it goes on with the real estate , Jo@@ chner could not say it has several refl@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; currently , there are a short term care of Car@@ itas and a diary of the Car@@ itas et . &quot;
&quot; what better could not happen , such an opportunity will not come back , &quot; &quot; says Fischer about the Qu@@ asi Mov@@ ing to the Le@@ ch , which was done by the staff &quot; &quot; positive and very understand@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house , has been working in the fisher@@ men for more than 30 years ago , have not been working . &quot;
&quot; he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues , to take over the post of the doctor . &quot;
&quot; the hospital P@@ ei@@ ter ( once 100 beds ) was threatened in the past decades again and again of closure , departments were closed , for example the surgery and the obst@@ et@@ rics . &quot;

lec@@ tur@@ fall with two last ones at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tra@@ kt@@ or@@ ers are difficult during their pen@@ isti@@ ls at the service in the afternoon by shots .
&quot; during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a Ma@@ is@@ feld near Pr@@ at@@ au ( Land@@ kreis Witt@@ enberg ) , there were several h@@ unters in action as the police agencies . &quot;
after a photograp@@ h suffered a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man severe in@@ jur@@ ies and were placed in hospitals .
&quot; just as it could come to the accident , was first un@@ clear . &quot;
the cri@@ minals .
&quot; Ver@@ mis@@ m 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhineland @-@ Palatinate , victims of Non@@ violence &quot;
he has led the police to the corp@@ ses who already miss 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhineland @-@ Palatinate .
&quot; at the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation of the 20 year old , the young people were killed and thro@@ wn their body into a channel in rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
one since Saturday the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhineland @-@ Palatinate is fallen victim to a non@@ viol@@ ent victim .
&quot; the hear@@ sal of the young woman was found at the service evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as Prosec@@ ut@@ or and police on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; as a tat@@ sus@@ pic@@ ion , one also applies to the all@@ eged 20 @-@ year @-@ party that result@@ ed in the statement , and the investigation into the place of the ly@@ re . &quot;
&quot; the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was already missed on Sunday morning after a visit to a week of autumn , in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen did not have been settled at home . &quot;
in search of young woman the investig@@ ators first refer to personal items of the offering .
&quot; in survey in freel@@ anc@@ ers and acqu@@ aint@@ ances , finally there was a tattoo against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; the mut@@ ated per@@ petrators led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the corp@@ se was found . &quot;
&quot; the red@@ emption gave the authorities to put into the police around , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old killed and the corp@@ se put in the can@@ al . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be held on Wednesday of the harbor , the investig@@ ators lay down on him k@@ illing . &quot;

refugees need accommodations : study war@@ ns before accomodation
the location on the German market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are searching for an affordable stay .
the pressure on the living @-@ market is growing .
the social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribu@@ tion@@ fig@@ hts of the German living @-@ market have long gone .
&quot; with the upcoming refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers from the EU more and more people on a market , which is already over@@ loaded in many major cities . &quot;
you will compete with comment on the Last paid @-@ pay@@ able apartments .
&quot; to cover the demand for cash @-@ in apartments , it would have to be built up to 400@@ .000 new units by 2020 . &quot;
the result is a study on behalf of the alliance of social housing .
&quot; as compared , this year in Germany 260@@ .000 units are ready . &quot;
&quot; thus , there are 140@@ .000 apartments . &quot;
&quot; refugees are no longer required after the first three months of their stay , as as@@ yl@@ um seek@@ ers to live in an initial recep@@ tive . &quot;
many come across to the apartment market and lie in the long ser@@ p@@ ents in front of the rent .
&quot; according to statistics of the Federal Government , the last year were lower than half of all as@@ yl@@ um seek@@ ers to rent . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the housing is not just on the increasing re@@ fuge@@ e . &quot;
the study also makes considerable om@@ issions in the housing policies of recent years .
Germany is a housing de@@ ficit in front of year ago that is larger from year to year .
&quot; currently lack@@ ed in the metrop@@ olitan areas already talked about 7@@ 70@@ .000 units , indic@@ ted Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
many occupation and therefore dwelt in Groß@@ städ@@ t not@@ th@@ aus@@ es in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults remained un@@ tar@@ ily due to the run@@ time on the living market un@@ vol@@ un@@ tar@@ ily longer at the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
in the large cities the number of square meters per cap@@ ita have fallen back in the past few years .
&quot; to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; soci@@ ally housing &quot; is a rest@@ art . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , new incen@@ tives should res@@ ume the social housing . &quot;
this might be exposed to the at@@ under@@ skin tax and the basic tax will be susp@@ ended to promot@@ ed apartments .
&quot; in addition , according to alliance attractive tax de@@ preci@@ ation is necessary . &quot;
the support programme for re@@ fuge@@ e income of the World Bank K@@ f@@ W is already working well in cities and communities .
&quot; a good week after the start was started on Monday night with 184 million euros , more than half of the currently available approximately 300 million euros . &quot;
now the project could even be stopped .

&quot; to Hungary is virtually no longer going through , there are more refugees crossing the way over Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb anno@@ unces the journey through Slovenia to North without hur@@ d@@ les .
dangerous is the route yet .
Croatia is facing the neighbor@@ ing country Slovenia through the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ or for refugees .
&quot; I talked to the slo@@ wen@@ ian Interior , and if it is necessary , we will organize a cor@@ rid@@ or , &quot; said the Croatian Minister of R@@ anko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Sch@@ engen zone .
the EU @-@ country Croatia is not yet an Sch@@ engen country .
&quot; after ab@@ olition of the Ser@@ bian Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees were broken down to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe . &quot;
500 people have come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik from the Croatian television stations R@@ TL .
Hungary had se@@ aled its border for refugees in advance .
&quot; new legislation that occurred on the same day in strength , make this decent as@@ yl@@ um process in Hungary practically superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
Croatia will allow refugees to happen .
Croatian Prime Minister of Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic said : &quot; You can go through , and we prepare ourselves for this possibility . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and to achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , there were people who did not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
Croatian police on the morning the first refugees had taken on the border of Serbia to the EU neighbor@@ ing country .
&quot; most of their belong@@ ings agree to Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came both by bus and taxi to the Ser@@ bian border town of Si@@ d .
immediately after their arrival they had tried to reach a walk over the green border to Croatia .
on the Croatian @-@ Ser@@ bian border the refugees don &apos;t escape to the Gren@@ ad@@ ale .
&quot; for this , the border cross@@ ings other dangers : there are still sharp min@@ es from the Yug@@ os@@ lav Civil War in the 1990@@ s . &quot;
Min@@ e@@ sp@@ er should now quickly create a safe passage .
&quot; after Hungary , after the closing of the border the border will hardly come more refugees . &quot;
on Tuesday the police were crossed .
just before the exp@@ ul@@ sion on Monday it had been 93@@ 80 .
the new Hungarian laws regul@@ ates the coming and damage of the Gren@@ ad@@ ale us as a crime .
&quot; in the south@@ eastern border city Sz@@ eged , there were therefore 35 cri@@ minal procedures . &quot;
the condem@@ ned pressure of sentence up to five years and the deport@@ ees from the land .
&quot; according to the information of the imm@@ ig@@ rant authorities , one I received a total of 94 A@@ sy@@ lan@@ es on Tuesday , nearly all - 93 - at the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
among the speakers are 13 families with small children and two el@@ derly persons .
at the end of the morning there were still 40 refugees stopped there .
&quot; however , no one has a view to get in Hungary A@@ sy@@ l . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; saf@@ er third country . &quot; &quot;
the ex@@ as@@ yl@@ um as@@ yl@@ um seek@@ ers are to be pus@@ hed there .
&quot; in front of the &quot; &quot; Trans@@ figuration &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke gathered only a few hundred refugees . &quot;
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke started workers to dream .
&quot; they gathered the tr@@ ash , the tens of thousands of people left in the road@@ side . &quot;
Sper@@ r@@ ash were abandoned and one of the recording in the bor@@ derland has been re@@ built .
at the goal of this ren@@ ame he wanted to give him no one .
Austria reach the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary only a few refugees .
the country also has its border contro@@ versi@@ al .
&quot; around 20,000 migrants were held to government officials but still in the country . &quot;
in Salzburg about 1400 people are waiting for the coming to Germany .
the road traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the order of the German authorities .
in Frei@@ um@@ ing regularly three groups of refugees were on foot on foot .
Mayor of &quot; designer &quot; over the border
&quot; we were busy after the bridge on Sunday with the Au@@ fr@@ atri@@ um , when suddenly ten people were standing up with passport , at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ te Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted to take the train to Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; because Germany on Sunday but because of the re@@ fuge@@ e stro@@ ms of rail trips had surpris@@ ingly damaged , so Stad@@ ler , he immediately offered his help and the rocks together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars about the border to the Middle Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; previously , we first had the un@@ expect@@ edly guests only once again , with J@@ ause and drinks . &quot;
&quot; we said equal , we take it by car to Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; this was self @-@ evident for us , &quot; so Stad@@ ler in O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let it take a generous don@@ ation - 100 Euros for the fire .
&quot; this is very happy about us , &quot; &quot; so Stad@@ ler . &quot;
the bookl@@ et were raised on Sunday evening in Wels by a regional train station in the direction of Pass@@ au in order to termin@@ ate it after the short notice that the rail transport was set to Germany but still over the border to try .
the regional train was placed before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein at the Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein is the border crossing generally high on the course .
&quot; the bridge @-@ festival with the Bav@@ arian neighb@@ ours of Sunday con@@ fin@@ ed , tags before a two @-@ brid@@ led sport@@ y - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
&quot; that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án , Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has now been sent to us , is a logical result of a apparently policy : &quot;
&quot; instead of being in the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately during the construction of structures to help humanity , our Federal Chanc@@ ellor has been officially recognized and public@@ ly established the attitude of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ lo@@ gue state of National Soci@@ alism . &quot;
ly@@ re @-@ bearing of this policy is not only those Austri@@ ans who are now con@@ fron@@ ted into the border areas with cha@@ otic states .
&quot; the ti@@ zen people will notice that the &quot; yellow@@ ed land &quot; that she invited them and welcome , nothing but another re@@ fuge@@ e camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a big challenge , given the ongoing re@@ fuge@@ e curr@@ ents and ful@@ filling winter , with us to produce decent conditions for protection seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; and there will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Konrad on the search for 35@@ ,000 hard@@ war@@ es Quar@@ ry
Konrad has full hands with the re@@ fuge@@ e .
Christian Konrad is it used to be his word weight .
the government has inser@@ ted the earlier mighty Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Ban@@ ker to set up lod@@ g@@ ings for thousands of refugees .
the chaos at the First@@ str . Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already get a grip on .
&quot; we have no hom@@ eless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he wrote about his first success . &quot;
&quot; accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had arrived on Monday to Austria was without great activity , &quot; &quot; Konrad and pra@@ ised the organiz@@ ational &quot; &quot; Master@@ power &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Interior spoke of a &quot; cau@@ tious situation . &quot;
&quot; total : Konrad with a requirement of 85@@ ,000 Quar@@ ter@@ ies in the Heur@@ iger year . &quot;
&quot; to meet the number , you must still be found 35@@ ,000 accommodations in the next few weeks - 20.000 shall the countries provide , 15@@ ,000 of the Bund . &quot;
&quot; if there are more refugees , we can create it . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a bar@@ rel without floor , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
in the state of the country he has already led the discussions .
&quot; they would have secured to him , nor for the coming refugees of lod@@ g@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Austria it is fine , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow , there will be a meeting with Card@@ inal Christoph Schön@@ born , where the church is supposed to help . &quot;
&quot; high expectations continues the as@@ yl@@ um @-@ ordin@@ ator also in the OR@@ F promotion , as well as we do . &quot;
on the platform 5 people can offer un@@ complicated accommodation .
&quot; in addition , you hop@@ ed to hotels that are empty throughout the winter . &quot;
Konrad and Ma@@ ier cri@@ tici@@ zed the standards of accommodation as &apos; very high .
&quot; in emer@@ gency , it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ s have to stick a certain amount of tow@@ el @-@ rail or size of the under@@ so@@ t . &quot;
for a fri@@ ght@@ ened time would have to be &quot; good standards . &quot; &quot;
&quot; that he was successful in contrast to the Ministry of Economic Affairs at the establishment of successful , Konrad with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an older Lord , which one says not without further into the face the fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
bel@@ iefs is his most important weapon .
&quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not cause the Republic no cost , as it asser@@ ted itself . &quot;
you want to increase your employees on three to four .
the own lod@@ g@@ ings had not yet been successful .
Konrad wanted to place a container at the Stephan@@ ing as an office .
but apparently there are problems with the permit .
Linz calls for better division
first no opening of municip@@ al orth@@ air sports and other buildings such as tips @-@ arena and design center for keeping refugees plans the city of Linz .
&quot; this is not currently necessary , as one might under@@ take these measures without these measures , &quot; said Mayor Klaus Lug@@ er ( SP ) . &quot;
for the emer@@ gency but further locations are to be checked on their de@@ ability .
criticism will be the manager in the division of refugees within the federal state .
also other distric@@ ts must make their contribution to their contribution .
&quot; seals , &quot; &quot; limits shall not be se@@ aled &quot;
&quot; in a longer telephone calls with the Bav@@ arian Prime Minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ( C@@ SU ) , Landes@@ mann Josef P@@ lek@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday the further proceedings of the Re@@ fuge@@ e survey . &quot;
&quot; Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer assured me that the German borders are not se@@ aled .
the re@@ work of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany are still possible .
&quot; however , the corresponding limit will now give you the appropriate limit . &quot;
bank@@ rupt@@ cies with refugees to Germany do not have to give it any more .
but the seek@@ ers would however be associated with regular bre@@ eds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; by the other EU member states to take a more intensi@@ fied solidarity in the re@@ fuge@@ e matter . &quot;
&quot; that now Austria has again entered into its borders , is a logical consequence of the procedure of the Germans . &quot;
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a question of time
the initi@@ ating of the &quot; New shi@@ py@@ ard &quot; in the line @-@ line is officially completed .
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production facilities , the b@@ ör@@ tic@@ ated IT Group has moved to S &amp; T , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the area of technology . &quot;
&quot; in the IT are the wise co@@ oks our raw material - and we must try that they work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T @-@ Chef Hannes Her@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
he could conc@@ eive , invest in Start@@ up firms in the New shi@@ py@@ ard and later also to be ak@@ eness . &quot;
&quot; right from the beginning , S &amp; T with the new neighb@@ ours co @-@ operate - of which he said : &quot; &quot; the next R@@ unt@@ astic is only a question of time . &quot;
&quot; $ 1,@@ 7 million Euro have been invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3.3 million euros in Tech@@ center , which one third of the city of Linz , the State Ober@@ österreich and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is held from Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meter space in the building are rented , for another 40 per cent give it requests . &quot;

&quot; this project had to take on the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of L@@ ia Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ti@@ k @-@ arcade sho@@ ots : finally , she has now received confidence in the form of another business . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop opposite of the business , in which it sold under other bags , cases , shoes and fabrics of different manufacturers , all about Dam@@ en@@ hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are from 75 Euro to have . &quot;
bigger pockets and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
since yesterday the new shop is in operation .
previously several weeks has been converted .
&quot; but I still remember , if I want to open a shop on a shop , &quot; &quot; says Brei@@ t . &quot;
&quot; decisive for the decision was among other things , that even the Fur@@ la producers who are in Bologna at home , from the idea of an own site , in which only her hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the n@@ ine@@ ties in the Groß@@ mann Linz , which sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has chosen Italian roots . &quot;

the Bru@@ ll@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
&quot; the Pf@@ al@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place , whose inhabitants are called . &quot;
this property is also associated with the Milli@@ on@@ aire the U.S. President wants to become president .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for set .
&quot; whether he is foreign to express , journ@@ alist or scientists in the international crisis of crisis - the applic@@ ants for the U.S. Pres@@ idency are strongly committed to the election campaign . &quot;
and cuts well off .
&quot; this is also registered in the fishing town of K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the agrit@@ ourism origin@@ ate . &quot;
the New York Habitat is a term for many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf at the Wein@@ straße .
man@@ cher in the 1200 @-@ inhabitants @-@ place is related to the 1200 laser cor@@ ners with it .
&quot; his grand@@ father came out of K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palatinate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in the elect@@ oral mode . &quot;
the Ch@@ all@@ städ@@ t Simone Wen@@ del was a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do the vill@@ agers about his goal to become the powerful man of the world ?
&quot; I think that somehow we find it exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their k@@ ies , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
the native k@@ all@@ städ@@ t has a am@@ using documentary on the place and its famous Spr@@ inkl@@ es to which besides Tru@@ mp also counts the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
&quot; Tru@@ mp , which is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) also to Word - so with the statement that he would surely would be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
to the king of the hearts he did not put it there .
&quot; I give respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to be the opinion that Tru@@ mp &quot; is a little bit like &quot; &quot; mau@@ l &quot; , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; allowed the Nickname &quot; &quot; K@@ all@@ jes@@ macher &quot; &quot; - to top : the Alb@@ ans , says it . &quot;
Tru@@ mp comes from the village of the offer@@ ings .
&quot; the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began in 1885 , when the later grand@@ father was em@@ ig@@ rated and opened in the U.S. a restaurant for Gold@@ gr@@ ä@@ ber . &quot;
corner@@ stone of the real estate was the first property sale in New York .
&quot; but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of Trag@@ ik : your desire to return to the homeland , command@@ ed the Bav@@ arian State to which the Palatinate was then belong@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tru@@ mp , because he once was ab@@ bey , the Director of the Institute for U@@ äl@@ z@@ ical History and Popular Culture , Roland Paul , for fil@@ start . &quot;
Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an illegal imm@@ ig@@ rants .
it stands in contrast to the mit@@ ry statements of the desc@@ end@@ ents .
&quot; the repe@@ at@@ edly talked to the Mexican imm@@ ig@@ rants in the USA and to the construction of a border wall , demand@@ ed illegal imm@@ ig@@ rants . &quot;
&quot; just as the pol@@ ished , that is not so lik@@ eable , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a remote master sh@@ mps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born Tru@@ mp , the Op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; win@@ em@@ akers in retirement sees the Americans rather dist@@ anced , &quot; he is always so thou@@ ght@@ ful . &quot;
believe he believes that Tru@@ mp comes ?
&quot; that can I not imagine , &quot; &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he has never had a c@@ avi@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ramm is mentioned as man@@ or K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a desc@@ end@@ ant of the family Heinz with a visit somewhat for the church org@@ el don@@ ated what generally well ank@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; so I cannot imagine , &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; they are better , if he did not want to choose the choice , because &quot; the one has such radical views , I do not know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had the sons for his grand@@ father in the U.S. , they had been such as he , &quot; would he never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter &apos;s Sarah B@@ üh@@ ler . &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; says it . &quot;
and : &quot; the grapes are also used without the president of Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; Wend@@ els movie , for the Tru@@ mp long inter@@ view@@ t , have 12 000 Kin@@ og@@ än@@ ger , also in the USA awak@@ ens the interest . &quot;
the above @-@ Bav@@ arian community Ram@@ s@@ au at Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is the first &quot; mountain@@ eering village . &quot;
&quot; from the hand of the Vice @-@ President at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ ennig , received the 1800 @-@ inhabitants village in the National Park Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden on Wednesday the award for public tourism . &quot;
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain@@ eering Burg@@ ers . &quot;
in the neighbor@@ ing country the dor@@ sal Alpine Club is responsible for the award of the award .
a &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf &quot; should be at most 2500 inhabitants .

&quot; the woman , at the Sam Wood in The Bachelor may eventually , was revealed in greatest sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
&quot; and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not be sure if she is the one that the last rose has received . &quot;
&quot; but when we with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on day , before the three two become , hyp@@ ed , you may have acci@@ dent@@ ally add a reference to who the winner will be . &quot;
Sam Wood continues to se@@ aled his lips to the fin@@ als on Thursday
&quot; all three women have settled on ly@@ rical way why wood is the perfect man and named his sense of hum@@ our , ambi@@ tion , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , when the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should receive W@@ oods &apos;s final rose ? &quot; &quot; could be their answers to the play@@ back , who won the heart of the wag@@ on . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki n@@ vest@@ ed both quickly - except itself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other on the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and ( Sar@@ ahs ) and S@@ ams energies , I felt that they were quite compatible , and I have thought that in the whole course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is standing with both feet on the earth , it is so much fun to be together with her &quot; she added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel pleasant and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood were well suited as a couple .
&quot; from her view he said M@@ ack@@ ay , that the house @-@ visit last week you made clear that Wood &apos;s might be &quot; &quot; its . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ condition@@ ally set up to him , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked to choose wood , if not them , then she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I do not know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the left @-@ loved girls ali@@ ke - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor is scheduled on Wednesday , 19 : 30h , on Ten . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to begin his NF@@ L career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in his move to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a clever decision .
&quot; some coach would have disp@@ ute Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bank , as he lost , as it is the Aus@@ sie Rugby Lig@@ a @-@ conver@@ tit at his first P@@ unt @-@ Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnes@@ ota . &quot;
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trust his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a p@@ unt return and also into the current play after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continue to show its true face in the changing rooms according to the game .
&quot; instead of his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team accompanied by the mill , he encour@@ aged them . &quot;

4 people killed but after polic@@ eman Rub@@ ber on prot@@ esters in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in the southern Nepal , after the police were dro@@ pped in a crow@@ ds , which demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , said an official on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke up on the day of Rup@@ and@@ eh@@ i , about 175 miles west of the capital of Kath@@ mandu . &quot;
&quot; Bis@@ hn@@ u pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ h@@ ak@@ al , leading Bezir@@ ks@@ burg , said that had more than 1,000 prot@@ esters outside of a police station , with some of you bri@@ cks and bran@@ db@@ om@@ b . &quot;
&quot; Mr D@@ h@@ ak@@ al said , the police have inser@@ ted Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and then moved into the air before they det@@ ached on rubber windows . &quot;
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civili@@ ans were viol@@ ated , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the pul@@ ated rub@@ bers of which is known that they may be able to kill , but traditionally produced as a less fatal alternative , apparently such a high level of deaths . &quot;
&quot; the examination was the last in weeks of viol@@ ent prot@@ ests in Nep@@ as southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of M@@ adh@@ esi can tell that new provinces , who would be formed in the framework of the proposed new constitution , which would decrease its political influence . &quot;
there were also prot@@ ests in the West Nepal by the ethnic group of the Laz@@ arus who want to have their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 poli@@ tici@@ zed , have been in viol@@ ent disp@@ utes since 10 . &quot;
&quot; killed , when the four major political parties were signed an agreement to divi@@ de the country in provinces , but an important step towards a new constitution , but a very contro@@ versi@@ al issue in Nepal , the centuries was centrally located . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legis@@ lat@@ ure acceler@@ ated the process after the dev@@ ast@@ ating earthquake , which killed in April thousands of people . &quot;
&quot; the bill introduced this week over certain cl@@ aus@@ ages in the constitu@@ tional design in Kath@@ mandu , and officials said that the new constitution might come into force on Sunday . &quot;

Google will start dou@@ bling @-@ donations campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
&quot; Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling @-@ donations campaign to bring 11 million $ for humanitarian organisations , who over@@ cast the European nations , since they came back from war and b@@ able countries . &quot;
Google has a un@@ usually personal approach to the announcement of the don@@ ate call on his blog .
&quot; instead of a manager let you make the announcement , &quot; wrote Rita Mas@@ oud , who was fl@@ ed with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; among our voy@@ age belong@@ ed to many dark railway and bus trips , as hunger , thir@@ st , cold and fear , &quot; wrote them . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the re@@ fuge@@ e and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , are looking for many people like my family des@@ per@@ ate according to help . &quot;
&quot; donations will go to four non @-@ profits and provide assistance for refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN @-@ Commission@@ er for refugees . &quot;

for slightly over@@ weight di@@ ab@@ etics can be helpful weight surgery .
the benefits of weights for slightly over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
&quot; it is still too early to tell if slightly over@@ weight people with diabetes after weight surgery longer live than those who won &apos;t @-@ surgical treatments . &quot;
&quot; the mort@@ ality data require a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery that wrote a edi@@ torial written on the new study in j@@ ama . &quot;
&quot; weight loss or ob@@ es@@ ity surgery , use different methods to res@@ ized the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the bodi@@ ly ability to take food .
&quot; over the years ob@@ es@@ itas surgery for the treatment of type @-@ 2 diabetes are proven to be efficient , but most studies have been carried out in people who are ob@@ s@@ ous ob@@ ese with a Body @-@ Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a degree of weight regarding size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24,@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is over@@ weight , and people with a BM@@ I more than 30 is regarded as ob@@ ese . &quot;
you can calculate your BM@@ I : 1.@@ us@@ Destinations / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study the researchers used by typ@@ ho@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital Data , which they have collected since 2007 in a study and compare two types of Adi@@ pos@@ itas surgery - Mag@@ enb@@ yp@@ ass and magne@@ tiz@@ ing - to medical treatments for type @-@ 2 @-@ diabetes among people who were slightly over@@ weight . &quot;
&quot; the average BM@@ I of those who were subj@@ ected to this operation , decre@@ ased from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
meanwhile the BM@@ I stayed with the one that did not @-@ surgical diabetes treatment received approximately equal to 29 .
&quot; among those who were subj@@ ected to a surgical procedure , about 36 % of diabetes effect , completely and at 28 % partially . &quot;
&quot; in the medic@@ ally @-@ treated group , in comparison to diabetes can only be made only by one percent and in part at only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results were better with the controls of blood pressure , the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Cholester@@ in &quot; generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , found the authors . &quot;
the researchers also monitor@@ ed the patient @-@ blood of Hem@@ m@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1C who reflects the blood@@ lines in the course of time .
&quot; Hä@@ m@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1C is best held under 7 per cent , write the researchers . &quot;
after surgery the average hem@@ m@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1C level of about 9 percent to around 6 percent .
&quot; however , in the medical treatment group it remained stable at about 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but these better &quot; gly@@ c@@ emic control &quot; - as you refl@@ ecting in the improved hem@@ m@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1C Level - reduced not the mort@@ ality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team will also see average results with the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ yp@@ ass surgery had lost more weight ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14,@@ 2 kg ) , matched even greater operations in BM@@ I ( 7.6 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded rather a complete over@@ coming of the diabetes ( 46,@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study has no survival for the surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of serious people in Sweden , that surgery leads to a longer life , he says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish trial , it was inter@@ fer@@ ous with ob@@ ese people who had turned in an ob@@ es@@ ity surgery , about 29 per cent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group , the conventional methods tried . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no advantage for the survival among the surgery patients , Black@@ stone , it was so@@ othing for persons with a BM@@ I under 35 , who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she told them . &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start producing more serious , as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; said it . &quot;
I gu@@ ess that as soon as they have accum@@ ulated this gen@@ etic changes that have established their bodies with ob@@ es@@ ity and diabetes is a revers@@ al really hard .

so also in the recently published novel &quot; actually we are not as &quot; by Luisa Binder .
&quot; moreover , the novel should be more interesting for H@@ uns@@ back@@ er readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot;

&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; Europe cannot include all refugees , the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the re@@ fuge@@ e crisis in the Middle East . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddh@@ ist leaders called for it to end the violence in the home countries of refugees .
the Dalai Lama spoke the problem of the ongoing re@@ fuge@@ e crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford .
he called that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of individual nations or even contin@@ ents .
he also emphas@@ ised that the reaction of western countries to the re@@ fuge@@ e crisis is ad@@ mir@@ able but the situation is not adequate .
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama in Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in dealing with the crisis pra@@ ised , he st@@ ressed that there is only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees , it is wonderful but in the meantime you need to think about long term solutions such as a true peace and genuine development , mainly by education , for these Muslim countries . &quot;
ultimately we must think about how the k@@ illing is reduced in their countries .
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama spoke the issue of violence and commented also George Bush &apos;s action after the terror@@ ist attack on 11 September and turned out that the viol@@ ent reaction of the USA moved a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after 11 September I put my sympathy in a letter to President Bush , and I told him , the way to sol@@ ving this problem lies in non @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his moti@@ ves were good , but he sat violence , and that has caused un@@ expected consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four @-@ fold increase from vene@@ er inf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the past 4 years
&quot; Gi@@ ft@@ contro@@ ll@@ ers in the United States report on an almost 400 @-@ process increase in the number of children under twelve years of age , the strong alco@@ holic and inf@@ ect@@ ants , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , conqu@@ er the cases of revenue of hand inf@@ ectious agents in children under 12 years of age groups , by 3,@@ 266 in 2010 at 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are getting more common to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the emer@@ gency room , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
he said that some children dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants can drink heav@@ ily while some things do to imp@@ ress their friends or due to a mut@@ ing on social media .
videos on YouTube show how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants only to drink because of a budget experience .
teen@@ agers has supp@@ os@@ edly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant with alco@@ hol@@ istic mouth@@ wash to get a tou@@ g@@ her bever@@ age .
younger children can be sc@@ roll from attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are par@@ fum@@ ed .
&quot; dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , wine @-@ grap@@ e and or@@ ang@@ es which are very appe@@ aling for children . &quot;
ham@@ en@@ ant inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
particularly in small children can already produce a few sy@@ ringe for alcohol po@@ is@@ oning .
&quot; it is highly focused alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , Medical Director of the Gi@@ ans@@ as Mountains at the Hospital of the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Channel Fox 4 in Kan@@ sa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you would not leave a si@@ ck whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children get in it , then it is a fast way to consu@@ me much alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year girl who had recently taken four spl@@ ash of straw@@ berry frag@@ rant and hand@@ craft@@ ed inf@@ ect@@ ants in school was brought into a good intake of treatment . &quot;
&quot; concentration was 179 , twice higher than the th@@ res@@ hold that counts in an adult law@@ ful than dr@@ unk , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a Emergency nur@@ ser@@ y that they treated in the G@@ win@@ ch Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah gave her words and was not able to walk when they arrived in the emer@@ gency .
&quot; doctors over@@ wat@@ ched them overnight in a separate children &apos;s disease @-@ house in signs of brain trau@@ ma , since the girl had fallen by the alcohol and having the head did he said Rit@@ ch@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; this was very fri@@ ght@@ ening , &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ahs Mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it would have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has parents and teachers recommended to use non @-@ alco@@ holic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants to use and hand@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
beyond Alcoholism det@@ oxi@@ fication were some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants associated with deaths .
&quot; in 2013 two women in Ontario women died in Ontario , according to the swal@@ low of hand@@ sh@@ ri@@ ds , which is a tox@@ ic , not de@@ formed ingredi@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; Health and health authorities would suggest that the product meth@@ anol is included , a fatal solution , rather than eth@@ yl@@ al@@ co@@ hol , which was noted as drug . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth category in the state New York , their &quot; &quot; Teacher &quot; &quot; teacher in the State of the US in January , making them an anti @-@ bacterial cultures around the class@@ room , so anno@@ unces a poli@@ ti@@ cian report . &quot;

&quot; we really need to really support Celtic , because the players are better doing . &quot;
&quot; now , we are so important . &quot;
W@@ arb@@ ur@@ ton careful in January @-@ transfers
despite his comments just a few weeks ago that he suggests a few January @-@ transfers , Rang@@ ers @-@ Boss Mark W@@ arb@@ ur@@ ton with the signing of the re@@ adily available and beh@@ ave that he will not dist@@ ur@@ b the unit of the I@@ bro@@ x @-@ squ@@ ad . &quot;
&quot; ex @-@ b@@ oss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; the January @-@ transfer window is very different from the summer @-@ window . &quot;
players who come in summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate with what you have seen with our own group in this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is lit by adding un@@ necessary player to add what you really need .
Celtic @-@ objectives
&quot; Sw@@ an@@ sea @-@ St@@ ür@@ mer Mich@@ u , with Celtic during the transfer period in conversation , announced that he could withdraw from when his contract with the Sw@@ ans . &quot;
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old has been pl@@ agues for two years with a trou@@ bl@@ esome Knu@@ ck@@ les and has not managed the finish of Wales this summer .
hearts focused on SF@@ A @-@ Battle because of N@@ eil@@ sons comments
&quot; the Hear@@ ts introduced 2 : 1 , when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent from the field and then lost 3 : 2 , but the red card of the Def@@ enders was later abandoned . &quot;
&quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains what he said , and hairy : &quot; I have no integrity in question , I have no achievement commented . &quot;
&quot; Griff@@ i@@ ths v@@ ow , Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le to avoid &quot;
&quot; the inde@@ fin@@ ely Hi@@ bee has been den@@ ied , after he added to have a song with decent articles about Ex Hear@@ ts players Rud@@ i Sk@@ ac@@ el . &quot;
the inci@@ dent occurred in a pub in the Ros@@ ebur@@ n of Edinburgh from a Edinburgh Derby in Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; it was a Derby , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; said the du@@ ms and added : &quot; it is surely to say that I don &apos;t return to Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le if it does not play for Celtic Glasgow . &quot;
Tan@@ na@@ di@@ ce Super@@ visory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee @-@ United @-@ Management
&quot; Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that the Management Board of Dun@@ dee United still has confidence in the management team , but along that the decl@@ ine has to end up on the playing field . &quot;
I think that Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son trust in us .

&quot; Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es dre@@ w that his team had to fight from Aber@@ deen des@@ per@@ ate against Hamilton Ac@@ cies , which brought them a adv@@ ancement of five points in front of Celtic at the top in front of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ on@@ eys mo@@ f@@ meter in the first half time . &quot;
&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; there is no crew that has won everything in poker , poker , or le@@ agues , the games of this kind could not have won . &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains un@@ changed while they increases in the UK altogether .
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained un@@ changed during the period of May to July at 16@@ 4@@ ,000 , while the number of people having no work for the United Kingdom as a whole in the same period for 10,000 to 1,@@ 82 million . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate was conducted by 5,@@ 9 percent on the U@@ CS of 5.5 per cent , as shown the numbers of the Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the employment in Scotland fell to 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2.@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; the employment rate for Scotland fell to over 7@@ 4,0 percent - a number above the UK average of 7@@ 3,5 percent . &quot;
&quot; Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented the latest numbers and said : &quot; &quot; the long term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly one year that Scotland made the historic decision to remain a part of the United Kingdom .
in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements on the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and decl@@ ine of unemployment .
dr@@ unk@@ ing the process
&quot; since the security guard could not be avo@@ ided , the employees ran the police . &quot;
only with the use of p@@ fe@@ ffer@@ spray the offic@@ ers could take the dist@@ urb@@ ing in cust@@ ody .
&quot; one of the good@@ ness , has been taken at a 16 @-@ year @-@ old 0,89 &quot;

why I will be wit@@ ness@@ ing an ex@@ position in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; a little later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will look at how a man brought to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens , and I hope that it is not happening , I will sit in an audience gallery in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Gl@@ os@@ si@@ p is ex@@ pi@@ ed by the Gi@@ ft@@ ect . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witness in his death .
&quot; the invitation was first mentioned in January for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shock@@ ed , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day moved closer , I began to fear me . &quot;
&quot; so , why should I do it ? &quot;
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good opportunity to tell the whole story about the death pen@@ alty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists can see ex@@ ecu@@ tions in the USA , and as often more applications are available as places are available , a mak@@ ab@@ ere lot@@ tery will be taking place to decide who is chosen . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media boats of 12 to five .
who is selected to observe it will be full of em@@ otion .
I cannot do that .
I will sit next to Richard Gl@@ os@@ si@@ ps dedicated friend where I have developed my own relationship over the months of telephone and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often lau@@ gh a lot if we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journ@@ alist , so it will not allow me to record a not@@ ebook and a pen to draw what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
&quot; a journ@@ alist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma anno@@ yed me on Twitter , to give me my imp@@ arti@@ ality . &quot;
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the ha@@ unts as he wants it and you get access .
I stri@@ ve me with her .
&quot; she dre@@ amed that she &quot; could have been better form@@ ulate , &quot; but they still thinks that it is wrong , what I do . &quot;
Richard Gl@@ os@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he does not tell me what I have to write , and I would not do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
he wants that an international repor@@ ters is present to write there .
&quot; if he die , he thinks that the public relations work will help against death pen@@ alty . &quot;
Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of pod@@ casts that I did . &quot;
I do not want to go back to all details here .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Gl@@ os@@ si@@ p is inno@@ cent .
his actions after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would render him to be one benef@@ ici@@ ary of action .
&quot; but I believe that a strong pro@@ bability , it is not of the dawn . &quot;
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justi@@ fy a blo@@ ody .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I can not claim to be truly objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters to which you can turn for it .
&quot; what you get from me is , what it is said to see a man an un@@ necessary death . &quot;
man to wet police @-@ followed hunt from the C@@ anning River to come
the C@@ anning Gu@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he spoke to the man of the C@@ anning River .
&quot; a man of Per@@ th , the police at@@ tach was successful , when he was in the sei@@ s@@ ory and sw@@ amp@@ y water , a few meters from a police station , he tried to return it g@@ ently , to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called on Tuesday to a gu@@ ilt @-@ rise in pel@@ vic cav@@ ity .
&quot; when they discovered the susp@@ ects , this one tried to escape into direction C@@ anning River . &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water@@ - and said &quot; &quot; I come out , come and get in me , &quot; &quot; said sen@@ ant Sh@@ and@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about how to make his uniform ill , therefore he turned out a reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; &quot; A good polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people funny things to try to escape , &quot; said sen@@ n@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ dine . &quot;

Peter M@@ oody claims that st@@ ew@@ ards eventually attemp@@ ted him to stop him and end the race @-@ sport
Peter M@@ oody claims that st@@ ew@@ ards from Racing Victoria tried to install a sp@@ y in its st@@ ables and dro@@ pped the race right away .
&quot; he aimed at the st@@ ew@@ ards and integrity of Racing Victoria and claimed that she was a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a racing @-@ day treatment , the last stro@@ h@@ hal@@ m on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; M@@ oody told Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for the racing sport and he found himself under difficult conditions , when it was the positive co@@ b@@ alt sw@@ abs in Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
&quot; he had looked at 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age sk@@ et@@ ches , and did not want to make it &quot; &quot; look like highly vi@@ ci@@ ous grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have been eating for a long time , but sometimes you are fru@@ str@@ ated that everything comes out once , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oody . &quot;
they know that it passed .
&quot; sometimes you have been respon@@ ded , and you must live with the consequences , and I must live with what I said . &quot;
I will go home today and sleep well .
&quot; I want to move away in my head , and I would like to think my owners think I will try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; if they begin to think I do not do this , then I should not be more train@@ ers . &quot;
I must then think about what I do with my license .
&quot; previously saved the bom@@ b in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the integrity of integrity had tried to speak its stable . &quot;
&quot; before eight@@ een months , Ter@@ ry B@@ ailey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stew@@ art in a room with a man - whom I will be asked , and offered him a employment in my st@@ ables to deliver information about what I do within my st@@ alls , &quot; said M@@ oody on Rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they apparently believe that I am a che@@ at .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly believe in their nos@@ es because they are in trying to deal with me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , eh@@ em . Chairman of the RV@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , acting President of RV@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ und@@ ro@@ mat , the latest CEO of RV@@ L , were aware of the time and are still today . &quot;
should I bring this to the view that it personally will be ?
&quot; the RV@@ L does not conduct your RV@@ L and makes people responsible outside train@@ ers , what is going on in the industry ? &quot;
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad@@ ly for the industry ?
maybe people think there that I am .
&quot; maybe they have to take me my license and come down , and I have no doubt that what I say , they can now think about it . &quot;
&quot; but I am now at the point where I am no matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
this really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and p@@ ushing them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the Fru@@ str@@ ating level of the trainer have built together with the long lasting Kob@@ alt study at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led that he said he might cast his license above the table . &quot;
&quot; M@@ oody , best known for his preparation for the un@@ protected master Black Caviar , marked the race @-@ treatment &quot; ri@@ dic@@ ulous &quot; &quot; after a pack of mud or clay on the horses began to beat the rules . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot;
&quot; I must take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my staff is mist@@ ak@@ enly mud on the leg .
it could have been so evening yesterday .
&quot; it could have been the whole day yesterday , which was so . &quot;
but it was also so on the race .
M@@ oody could be con@@ fron@@ ted with a three @-@ month Dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack of the race . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
&quot; people who make these rules , don &apos;t know about the horse . &quot;
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you go too far , &quot; said M@@ oody . &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy stri@@ kes against ri@@ vals because of claims
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has criticism of the Sl@@ ackl@@ ing his player as &quot; Agenda setting &quot; of two Premier League &apos;s Favorites of the NR@@ L .
Sydney Roo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ rator will allowed the Storm @-@ player &quot; Ring@@ strug@@ gles &quot; with his team during the high Storm @-@ victory in the qualifying finale in Sydney on the Fri@@ day@@ trip .
&quot; Bris@@ bane Bron@@ co Trainer Wayne Benn@@ ett made a few crazy note about the Storm Team , after his team achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on the Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; &quot; sample &quot; &quot; of the Rugby League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land does not work too well . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy pre@@ ached the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team , and said that she was concent@@ rating at the Sl@@ ackl@@ ing just to their &quot; contact . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy paste , added that the criticism of two leading train@@ ers on his team can make him clearly , since it was worried that they are worried about the Storm Team . &quot;
&quot; this emerg@@ es again - I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson about Ring@@ strug@@ gles , when they gave us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ ingham on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we have not changed throughout the year for nothing at our def@@ en@@ sive system or the techniques . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with s@@ ackl@@ es a real focus , and this has been made for us the trend . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . it is therefore probably not to lose an ordinary , so it was a bit like a shock for him . &quot;
it is a strange thing as it was always up to this season .
&quot; Bell@@ amy cement an idea of &quot; &quot; exciting baby &quot; &quot; and his ment@@ or rem@@ ind@@ ed that Benn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons the Premier League in 2010 won &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; football . &quot;
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he was compared to his game on Saturday evening with our day in the release and how exciting her game was , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George as a boring team was cri@@ tic@@ ised , and Wayne said that he will take care of a failure . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team to play , and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
&quot; this is the ballet , which you want to play if you have this kind of players . &quot;
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of so@@ ccer - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt , so they can play as these . &quot;
&quot; I build a stronger trust because they say these things , because they are a bit worried against us . &quot;
six weeks ago she did not think of us when it was about the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy pointed out that the game Storm against roo@@ sters is a higher result of the game bron@@ cos against Cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I have not seen it , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
or are p@@ aus@@ es do not make any points something exciting ?
for me it is the multi@@ tainer .
&quot; if they mention us , it means we will be able to meet them in a phase . &quot;
the Storm Team has free to receive this weekend as they have the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday evening in the morning of the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sale begins from next service tomorrow .
&quot; Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ deposit to Dro@@ gen@@ an@@ kl@@ age &quot;
&quot; a man who may dro@@ pped a li@@ fel@@ ong sentence because of his understanding , in the possession of 40 kil@@ ogram of co@@ conut , which were for@@ ged to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of 200@@ .000 $ . &quot;
&quot; Marko Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police on the Yacht Sol@@ ay met that came from South America through Vanuatu and in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c has been observed , as he met his fellow @-@ def@@ endants in the late afternoon and later in the café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police were 40 kil@@ og@@ rams of the drug in a Toyota echo . &quot;
&quot; despite a possibly li@@ fel@@ ong pen@@ alty for trying to own a commercial amount of co@@ bs , arg@@ um@@ ed the law@@ yer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c that there was no evidence whatsoever that he tried to own the entire quantity and that in the café being of a harm@@ less reason . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the flights to Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often trav@@ elled to Serbia , &quot; he explained the court on Wednesday . &quot;
in the cri@@ minal , he made the police over his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic@@ s mother and step@@ father had a deposit of 200,000 Dollar as security in common to achieve its release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the vi@@ able statements of the two persons , it is clear that the edition of a security of 200,000 Dollar is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; said Justice tu@@ ag@@ an . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not be enough to stop him , not to appear , war@@ ned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against deposit , under the circumstances that he scor@@ es his Australian and his ser@@ a@@ ic Pass to stand up on the police and stand up on a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;

&quot; he gave to that the search on the computer has been carried out by him , but it was done because he wanted to claim a polic@@ eman , to fri@@ ght@@ en a polic@@ eman . &quot;
he was asked about his interviews with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and the he asked to send more pictures .

J@@ VA Berlin @-@ T@@ egel : five square metres cells are human @-@ un@@ worthy
the Bundes@@ ver@@ fassungs@@ gericht has given an ex @-@ ha@@ un@@ ted T@@ egel in a single cell that was hous@@ ed in a small cell .
&quot; due to the violation of their human dignity , prison@@ ers are generally right to financial compensation , when they are hous@@ ed in small cells . &quot;
this has decided the Bundes@@ ver@@ fassungs@@ gericht in a decision on Wednesday .
suffer@@ ers may even return the judges even then to money if they were only a few days in the lead to close rooms ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 112@@ 7 / 14 ) .
&quot; with this was a ex @-@ ha@@ un@@ ted with his constitu@@ tional complaints in Karlsruhe , he was hous@@ ed in a single cell line between June and November 2009 in a single cell with around five square meters floor space ; the toilet was sp@@ atial yet . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man was transferred to an open foot according to the details of his bill , into a larger cell . &quot;
his ministry is due to the un@@ fortun@@ ate liability conditions against the land of Berlin .
&quot; however , the constitu@@ tional judges ho@@ es the judgment of the chamber law Berlin on and referred to the case for renewed testing there . &quot;
you will see the man &apos;s dignity .
Kammer@@ judgment is now decided about the amount of compensation
&quot; even if from legal reasons for the frag@@ ment period is only a few days of dis@@ man@@ t@@ ling for the compensation of a few days , be a comparison of compensation , was it meant . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , it would be a short@@ coming of the rule of the personality to fear . &quot;
the chamber sector must now clear the amount of money compensation .
the constitu@@ tional judges have often strengthened the rights of prison@@ ers in the past .
&quot; so they only spoke to April a heads of damage , because he was naked in a cell . &quot;
&quot; Human @-@ un@@ worthy is a decision of 2011 , including the multi@@ purpose of a cell without a separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Karlsruhe have also att@@ ested in the Berlin constitu@@ tional Court that had reached an un@@ it@@ ary accommodation in November 2009 . &quot;
the then compla@@ in@@ ant was accommod@@ ated over three months daily between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe .
the Berlin pris@@ ons were also reached in the last weeks because of lack@@ ing personnel in the headlines .
&quot; prison@@ ers will therefore always be included 23 hours , agg@@ ression increases , even too sleep@@ y even for the ten@@ se situation had already come . &quot;
&quot; after the information of the pen@@ it@@ ments are 21 locations in T@@ egel , because of offspring , 19 November 2016 away . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the Re@@ fuge@@ e policy : &quot; we are creating the &quot;
the migration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chanc@@ ellor is decided to accept them .
what is coming to Germany ?
&quot; around 800 000 Az@@ yl@@ um seek@@ ers will come to Germany after forec@@ asts of the Federal Ministry for Austria , by statement by Vi@@ z@@ ek@@ anz@@ ler Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to accommodate a million refugees . &quot;
German Chanc@@ ellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated in view of the unusual challenge dra@@ ver@@ ing : &quot; I say again and again : we can do that , and we create it . &quot;
&quot; what is coming to Germany , is suggested by the following overview . &quot;
&quot; needed for different forec@@ asts between 35@@ 0000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Finance ) , and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el @-@ Institut ) apartments annually - and for the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 25@@ 0000 residen@@ ces ) .
&quot; dram@@ atic is the lack of living room but mainly in pricel@@ ess rental objects : annually , 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social housing dating back to the rental price , and around these particularly cheap apartments will also apply to refugees . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Minister of Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to promote the promotion , of currently 518 million on one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el @-@ Institute : 80 000 social housing every year would have to arise and for this , the federal government would have to invest in the amount of 6.8 billion per year . &quot;
scientists and the Federal Ministry are explained that there are also more tax benefits for investment in housing construction .
&quot; after estim@@ ations of the Institute for labour market research , it is possible to extend the long @-@ term 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany in the long term . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany would not demand system@@ atically after their qualification to help them get started , cri@@ tic@@ ised Claudia Walter , project Management for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
but it is decisive for the integration of refugees and it is decisive whether they are able to work in Germany .
&quot; work is the key for social contacts , for appreci@@ ation in the reception , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of the imm@@ ig@@ rants , says migration of Christian Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , there has been a political turn : from working to refugees to recognis@@ e work . &quot;
&quot; while it used to be a working group for as@@ yl@@ um seek@@ ers from up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the Residen@@ ces , the as@@ yl@@ um seek@@ ers to a residence . &quot;
&quot; in society , the view of the qualified labour @-@ angels - was emphas@@ ised the view that it should be possible to allow refugees to access to the labour market . &quot;
a large hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is lack of English .
so far there is no adequate supply of general and person @-@ related courses .
research also show that jobs most commonly referred to through personal contacts .
the creation of networks is therefore according to the view of Thr@@ än@@ hardt of the König@@ s@@ weg .
&quot; the Berlin debt administration has found that only a few refugees were able to give their children to the kit@@ as , estimated 10 to 15 per cent : &quot; for the escap@@ ed parents , it is only once very important to joining the family , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ unds , spok@@ es@@ man for youth and family at the Berlin Sen@@ at@@ sver@@ w@@ altung . &quot;
&quot; to convince the family from the advantages of the K@@ ita , the management distributed in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need for employees should rise greatly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Sen@@ at would try to increase the voc@@ ational capacity - about by putting more universities . &quot;
in the countries students are prepared without German expertise in Wel@@ coming classes .
&quot; but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers and teachers , but , as in Berlin , even by teachers , who only have a qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no short@@ age , says Beate plays from the Berlin train administration . &quot;
the Deutsche Stud@@ enten@@ werk was estimated that about 20 percent of refugees to study in Germany .
&quot; strictly prohibited any state of as@@ yl@@ um seek@@ ers or imp@@ end@@ ent study - the only exception was to Berlin , interior Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has now added his attitude now . &quot;
&quot; up @-@ to @-@ consent , the access to the college could be facilit@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; for refugees with a stay of residence or Dul@@ se do not receive services after the as@@ yl@@ um seek@@ ers , if they begin studying a study . &quot;
&quot; the latter is not given no BA@@ f@@ ö@@ G , since it does not fall under the circle of the outside people . &quot;
&quot; Ge@@ dul@@ ated refugees had to have lived four years in Germany so far to be entitled to BA@@ f@@ ö@@ G , from 1 January 2016 to short@@ ened these funds to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but this financing of financing needs to be closed , for Steffen Kra@@ ch , Ber@@ lins State Secretary for Science , and the Deutsche Stud@@ enten@@ werk . &quot;
the students should immediately get BA@@ f@@ ö@@ G .
&quot; Islam will continue to play a more important role in the future because many refugees are Muslims , and for many is the religion an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should emer@@ ge Islam in the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ Ch@@ urch@@ es have been pursu@@ ed to a new state @-@ religion ratio . &quot;
&quot; important would also be the foundation of a Islamic State &apos;s Association , which is professional to take care of the new@@ com@@ ers . &quot;
the rights are also obligations .
&quot; thus , the representatives of Islam must be clear and willing to work with the state in many fields and to develop some control options . &quot;
&quot; this also includes willingness , to be part of religious fundament@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , commented on Thursday the concern , religious conflicts may also be registered in Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to take such conflicts in Germany , &quot; immediately have their right to stay here in Germany , &quot; said he said in the Bav@@ arian Rund@@ funk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the constitution on Arab@@ ian .
&quot; in future , integration will be much more than today a topic of the whole society today . &quot;
&quot; thus , the majority of discrimination is also required to change the reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism . &quot;
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - since a scar@@ ce decade and a anti @-@ discrimination law and a general equality law .
&quot; but it lear@@ ns very slowly , as the NS@@ U series showed , in the police and authorities the rac@@ ist motive system@@ atically ignor@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; equal opportunities for all : what migrants organizations and stak@@ eholders were committed to international agreements like the anti@@ rac@@ ist Convention , in the next few years , when the country must remain peaceful and use its new citizens - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general Germany , Germany is now able to provide the expected refugees to predic@@ t the anticip@@ ated refugees says Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; regarding Man@@ - Power and capacity , we create the &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , all money must flow into the system . &quot;
avoid fr@@ asses to avoid Mont@@ gom@@ ery to carry out all com@@ ers equal to the registration of health cards .
encour@@ aged performances could be dis@@ closed later with the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; and long @-@ term , it would be most frag@@ ile , so many people with the restricted use catalogue on the as@@ yl@@ um seek@@ ers . &quot;
otherwise the physi@@ cians make the language bar@@ riers to create .
&quot; so far , the Berlin health scienti@@ fic@@ ally proved to be proven to be worse by their diseases being worse than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , also in doctor &apos;s practice would have to be taken over . &quot;
&quot; it would be a lot of refugees , but also with more general health conditions at the emer@@ gency patient out@@ patient . &quot;
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; among refugees , there is clearly more un@@ treated disabilities , and among young people there are about HIV . &quot;
&quot; with the partly other hospitals c@@ rop@@ es German doctors from their education , but clearly , says Mont@@ gom@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ite @-@ loss or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not as hard to recognize , &quot; and regarding the trou@@ bles , whether by the refugees are even alle@@ vi@@ ating even alle@@ vi@@ ating in sight . &quot;
&quot; Syri@@ ans would have had a high @-@ condition educational system , several refugees are even doctors . &quot;
&quot; in order to practice , it would have to prove their qualification and bl@@ ur@@ ably further tests . &quot;
at least half of the refugees arrive in Germany is still ill @-@ psych@@ ic disease ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) psych@@ ic ill : most suffer from an post @-@ traumatic injury or under depression .
&quot; in@@ viol@@ ent of re@@ fuge@@ e , says Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recently published study of the Technical University Munich pro@@ claimed that every fifth of Syrian re@@ fuge@@ e trau@@ matis@@ ed in Germany .
&quot; who is in an post @-@ traumatic injury is suffering from other things to so called Flash@@ backs with resp@@ iration , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart , and death . &quot;
further symptoms are sleeping and concentration of tox@@ icity and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
&quot; to prevent the symptoms were chron@@ ic , be an early treatment necessary , said Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; to date , only four per cent of the psych@@ ic sick refugees arrive . &quot;
&quot; may be psych@@ ic sick as@@ yl@@ um seek@@ ers in the social @-@ states a request for a psych@@ otherapy , but the adaptation usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; moreover , in the social welfare , mostly of experts or doctors , who are not educ@@ ated for the psych@@ ic diseases , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this is often leading to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;

&quot; expected sales growth leads to a burden of more than 2.7 billion dollars over the fourth quarter , then HP has been in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; this re@@ struc@@ turing measures will be a competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive who is to conduct the unity according to the separation . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise is smaller and more foc@@ uss@@ ed than it is HP today , and we have a wide and deep@@ ened portfolio of shops who support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;

FC Ar@@ sen@@ al @-@ Kap@@ captain Mich@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb are behind the ver@@ last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; W@@ EN@@ GER st@@ ressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September , and provided his rehabilitation after plan , there is no reason why he cannot play back before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optim@@ istic scenario will mean that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England , and given its history in the next summer near the enlargement thr@@ ill . &quot;
the great shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended up the last season after a separate bu@@ ck hur@@ t@@ ling and then returned to his old pig during the pres@@ eas@@ ing season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not threat the career , &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
&quot; it is a bones , which is not good cur@@ sed . &quot;
this is not a bigger aff@@ air .
this was just an accident .
it was not connected with his kne@@ es or with the in@@ jur@@ ies he had previously .
&quot; it may be true of pure medical point of view , but like W@@ enger also recognized , there is a depend@@ ant danger of further in@@ jur@@ ies , always when a player tries to return in the season . &quot;
it also develops a un@@ pleas@@ ing pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister In@@ jur@@ ies Ltd reveals 23 different disorders of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut in six years .
he also played in 65 von Ar@@ sen@@ als 157 le@@ ather@@ ings in the last five playing times .
the bro@@ ader picture for ar@@ sen@@ al is that they have been in six of eight play@@ times since 2007 / 08 of one of the two Premier League Clubs that have to have the most vulner@@ ability .
&quot; W@@ EN@@ GER accepts the potential of a devil , but Ar@@ sen@@ al believes that an improvement in vulner@@ ability ratio during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes if you come back from a violation , you have a sus@@ pic@@ i@@ ous period , a time when you strengthen your body and fight mar@@ tial arts , &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body is stabili@@ zed , I am confident that he will do it and he will run a career out of the way he deserves . &quot;
&quot; ar@@ sen@@ al begins his Champions League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ sp@@ ur next Wednesday , and W@@ enger presents itself a rotation within the team . &quot;
&quot; H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not come to Croatia , which means Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ or@@ y and Art@@ eta is set to start . &quot;
W@@ EN@@ GER can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gi@@ b@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and keep the players who need to explo@@ it a little off @-@ off break , &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
&quot; although ar@@ sen@@ al clear favorites are , through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ me @-@ stadi@@ um belongs to Zagreb with the largest in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe . &quot;
&quot; Dynam@@ o is also un@@ loaded after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign launched in the last season . &quot;
the stadi@@ um was shi@@ fted on Tuesday evening through an earthquake focusing on Rich@@ ter@@ sk@@ ala 3.2 .
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; W@@ EN@@ GER is the opinion that Ar@@ sen@@ al has drawn up the teaching from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and remains of hope to lead the association with his first European Council tri@@ umph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
it has never worked out at Ar@@ sen@@ al .
&quot; we were in 2006 very close to this , but on the other side I am long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
we are ambitious but we are not a dre@@ amer .
Friend@@ ly Fest : the comedy show that hur@@ ries us serious lessons about men @-@ friendly
&quot; the lack of similar shows in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up , now even dou@@ bt@@ ful than ever before , as self @-@ ass@@ ass@@ ins among young men on a 15 @-@ year show . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important dead@@ ly cause in men at the age of 20 to 45 in Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ism ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a inher@@ ited life ) 2015 than the year of the man , with the aim of finding the culture in question the men to seek assistance when they need . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the struggle to tackle this challenge .
&quot; a recent study with more than 2@@ ,000 High @-@ school students impressed with depres@@ sive symptoms that when the suffer@@ er had a sufficient high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; its chances of recovery . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not depres@@ sed , hal@@ ogen@@ ated a circle of ment@@ ally healthy friends the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course you have to have to have friends , that a friendship may work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of more than social media , communication , focusing on style on substance is often more important than an important contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital life have the need to appear strong , life @-@ fun and successful to appear , dou@@ bled , even if in reality the insulation is domin@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; this superf@@ icial success is dominated by the domin@@ ating what psych@@ ologists ex@@ trinsic values , money , image , social status , all at cost in@@ trinsic values - our inner long@@ ing for personal development and friendship , which affects our mental health much more deeply . &quot;
and like a vide@@ osp@@ iel @-@ inv@@ entor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not be bought . &quot;
beauty with Friends was that these foc@@ uss@@ ing was put on the head .
&quot; every character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , defined by interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humor of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ lers Happy hug@@ s , moments when football gu@@ ess in cozy arm@@ chairs and long@@ ing from R@@ oss to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can certainly relate to it , even if they have often rec@@ all their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as an employee of telephone care it explained : ... &quot; my listen@@ er role for people who are feeling depres@@ sed and self @-@ haz@@ ard@@ ous , showed me really clearly how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
&quot; the men who contact us feel often not able to talk with friends . &quot;
&quot; the old re@@ de@@ dev@@ otion &quot; &quot; I come &quot; &quot; has a trem@@ endous effect as the feeling that it is perc@@ eived as a weak@@ ness when talking about problems . &quot;
little Friends is one of the shows that comes to me in mind when I try to offer long @-@ term preservation .
it most clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
&quot; so much my objective out@@ sider tips about the telephone number can also help people with desp@@ air , the long term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
and so if you visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the celebration of the day completely newly designed setting , why do not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better if you want to sit in Star@@ bu@@ cks someone alone , give him a smile and say hello hello . &quot;
one never knows what difference can make your friendship .
friends will be directed at Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - all of the 236 epis@@ odes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest

&quot; di Mary met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League deb@@ ü@@ ts as po@@ inting players who increased the French masters to their path , but after it finally scor@@ ed its advantage than Cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Sch@@ acht@@ eb@@ Don@@ ez@@ k also in group A takes a strong start to the Swedish Master , since it does not only seek the qualification for the K.@@ O.@@ -@@ rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , there was no class esp@@ iel by Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic@@ s missed opportunity in front of the gate . he later started in the game against his home town team and against the association , with which he began his illustr@@ ated career already in the year 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to win home or up@@ ward to win in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start to gain problems and relaxed , even if there are certain things that we have to exc@@ ite in the course of season , &quot; &quot; says Blanc . &quot;
&quot; this is a good sign .
&quot; we wanted to win and we have won , even though I got it da@@ ir@@ y that we have not yet achieved one or two more gates . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to his bre@@ ach of three changes to the Paris team , that on week@@ ends a 2 : 2 Un@@ decided to keep its own place against Bordeaux in the first le@@ ague , but he was engra@@ ved in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ inian wing stor@@ ms was referred to as the man because he was taken over the next stage in Europe when he was in the last month of Manchester United States , before he finished in Johan Wil@@ and finished in the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; however , someone believed that I would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malm@@ ö to hit the Celtic in a play @-@ off to achieve this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff contr@@ acting with nine national players on the field and was called a serious opponent . &quot;
&quot; but apart from a shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , which joined by Kevin Tr@@ unk P@@ fo@@ sten at the 34@@ th minute , offered them little in attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , I sometimes gave himself on , with some mis@@ ses and bad cut @-@ ups , not least from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was used not less than five se@@ eks alone in the first half , after Cav@@ ani had been used to re @-@ start after re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he pointed much more skill when he brought his fellow @-@ players into the game , and it was a pass of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , the Di Maria in a bar@@ rel @-@ shot , which was guided by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the fo@@ ster ... &quot;
&quot; the second gate still fell short after the hour brand thanks to Cav@@ ani . the dr@@ yers achieved the sixth Seas@@ on@@ tor , after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had left a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; it ended all thoughts that Malm@@ ö was able to come back into the game , and only an excellent input from Wil@@ low from short@@ est distance to stop David Lu@@ iz before replacement springs E@@ z@@ equ@@ iel Lav@@ e@@ zzi a gate at the end was det@@ ected . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malm@@ ö , age arm@@ or , gave later to having a class about his team and the Norwegian did , &quot; &quot; our last Champions League game was in December last year . &quot;
&quot; since then , we played only in the Swedish le@@ ague that did not have the same level . &quot;
the qualification @-@ games are not sufficient . &quot;
hut from Paris !
it was a great game of them !

Detroit Tig@@ hts Jung@@ le of Minnes@@ ota Twins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ OL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny .
&quot; formerly she was one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand at the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as Sp@@ o@@ iler , but played this part in Tuesday perfect against the Minnes@@ ota ples with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field . &quot;
the Twins p@@ added a chance for A@@ scen@@ sion within a game of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card .
&quot; for Detroit , although only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter R which was so hard to deal with half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all wins make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot;
Tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held its early offen@@ sive support since Detroit had extended three times in the first two interior then once in the sixth and then once again at the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) proposed 6 times in the 1 / 3 inside and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was a third of successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I will end this year strong , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to throw at the bul@@ l@@ ity every game , and therefore I will concentrate entirely on the game . &quot;
&quot; the designed Tiger @-@ h@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first r@@ ash since mid @-@ August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first hardcore hit of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since then he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on 6th July . &quot;
&quot; he has good ru@@ lers well weak@@ ened , &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( stroke ) , saw clearly better from the bul@@ l@@ les , and he carried it straight into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three oxen in the back at the end of the seventh sewing , the Twins had their best chance to get back into the game . &quot;
center FI@@ EL@@ DER By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the in@@ ning with one double on the left fiel@@ ding line .
right FI@@ EL@@ DER Aaron H@@ icks achieved a b@@ unt and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ cks to the stri@@ ke@@ out before it was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Hard@@ y .
&quot; hardcore survi@@ ved wall , the only man who con@@ fron@@ ted with which he was faced with the designed R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ schl@@ mann Miguel S@@ ano which was designed to set the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen a two @-@ run . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of run@@ ners and the final run of the second , Ver@@ hagen to the third bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe on a double play . &quot;
it was that in the Major League leading the last 27 times in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe has a double ball stroke
&quot; after Detroit had added a Insurance bro@@ kers , Berlin Wall a R@@ BI double , against the Cl@@ os@@ er of the Tig@@ ers Bruce R@@ ond@@ on and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; however , the right @-@ handed people say S@@ ano at three Pit@@ ches for his fifth save . &quot;
Detroit wrote the pr@@ el@@ ude of the game of an even not mov@@ able Phil Hug@@ hes .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers scor@@ ed three R@@ uns in the first two inside against the right @-@ stand @-@ veter@@ an that had been stopped in front of the game by the vulner@@ ability , after he had no more than one month ago . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wish , said Hug@@ hes , &quot; &quot; said Hug@@ hes , &quot; &quot; but I felt adri@@ ler but I felt and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches as in the third in@@ ning . &quot;
&quot; after they received the Le@@ ad@@ off bat@@ ter , H@@ ash gave a single to second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; a two @-@ out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to the game , who made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game . &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z finished his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the Run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed by a single on the right hand , managed by a further run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was cast out of the game as he tried to enter into the third , what the threat ended . &quot;
the Tig@@ ers took a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ FI@@ EL@@ DER Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; it was a great blow , &quot; &quot; I Twins @-@ Manager Paul mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he did not have a particularly well be@@ aten , but he has caught the right place . &quot;
Hug@@ hes found himself in a Pitch Count was not generated points in the third In@@ ning before it was replaced by the rel@@ ic Rig@@ h@@ th@@ and A.@@ J.@@ As@@ chter .
at Hug@@ hes it came to three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stri@@ kers .

Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
almost 500 years after the Reformation there is a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz .
in the presence of Stadt@@ Museum Ig@@ na@@ zio Marino was announced on Wednesday a so far place in the park on the Opp@@ io hill on the name of the German re@@ former .
&quot; in the &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; he is now hon@@ oured as &quot; &quot; German the@@ olog@@ ian of the Reformation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ osse@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the Work@@ station of the ev@@ angel@@ ical churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , past@@ or of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , rem@@ ind@@ ed that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es over centuries as a minority could often only live in secret . &quot;
&quot; with the place I become visible in symbo@@ lic , that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome was welcome . &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) held herself as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the annual revolution 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he received the town at that time as a ar@@ gu@@ ed sin@@ ner .
his negative impressions looks set to disp@@ ute him according to the view of histori@@ ans in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther then had initi@@ ated with his thes@@ es against the Abl@@ as@@ sh@@ ion and the split of the final Church .
Hammer artists invested in the personal interpretation of the Bible
&quot; Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) Dorn@@ enk@@ rone is one of the buildings , the Ott@@ mar Alt for his Bible . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and will be updated .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not at the ot@@ mar @-@ old Bible , which now has been released with magnificent images . &quot;
in the beginning the picture was form@@ ulated for ot@@ mar Alt which has form@@ ulated his very personal interpre@@ tations of Scrip@@ tures on paper and canvas .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - what is by no means syn@@ ony@@ mous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
&quot; on the contrary , it is adapted to the respective topics , it can quite inf@@ all . &quot;
&quot; about three years old James Alt on his Bible project , for which he has met a subj@@ ective @-@ artistic selection from the many topics of the &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; ar@@ ose are cycles that dedic@@ ate themselves like cross@@ roads , Pl@@ ages , command@@ ments or fa@@ ther@@ to our country . &quot;
&quot; with this , he has fascin@@ ated several partners : this is valid for the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with his focus on art books . &quot;
&quot; and there is especially the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has placed himself on the basis of the painting with the respective Bible . &quot;
&quot; he has interpre@@ ted the Bible of ot@@ mar Alt selected Jump@@ s and translated into the Today , into current co@@ her@@ ences . &quot;
these texts are like lat@@ al mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible in Martin Luther and each one set of the artist who form@@ ulated his very personal thoughts to the respective situation .
the jewel @-@ shell has golden Let@@ ter .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old is the same twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high level of in@@ timacy .
&quot; ultimately , emotions were ultimately not at all trigger for the bi@@ ble project : ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in Wer@@ nig@@ er@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belongs to the strict prot@@ est@@ ant ru@@ lers . &quot;
&quot; then the education happened time with the pipe , &quot; remember &quot; &quot; ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I have tried to stop that , to carry me again with the Lord Father . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to help the art in the fast @-@ time period , &quot; &quot; the perception of educational institutions is marked today of advertising , and that is loud . &quot;
Symbolism is there ur@@ ged .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures have always something mys@@ tical and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ os@@ au@@ r . &quot;
&quot; I would like to let the viewer fall into the pictures . &quot; &quot; let them have been able to discover and feel which force they have : &quot; &quot; the image is looking for its counter . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost opened on Tuesday at the presentation of the ot@@ mar @-@ old Bible in the ot@@ mar @-@ old Bible , &quot; &quot; ever said &quot; &quot; a lover of ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art , &quot; &quot; I like how to compre@@ h@@ end with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; old I have not heard this , the Bible is completely understood but to be chosen for him as well as mysterious themes . &quot;
&quot; this was not a collaboration on eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it comes to the pictures , the text explains merely . &quot;
&quot; for Hans Mö@@ g of Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to find his life to deep and freedom . &quot;
ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for g@@ ots both the ( bibli@@ cal ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and linen - is presented for the first time in an exhibition which will be opened on November 15 at the ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
start @-@ up for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn
&quot; plans made , place found , companies commissioned by a round @-@ course : one year later was nearly all finished - yet even before the official opening of the BM@@ X @-@ Bahn was at the end again . &quot;
&quot; om@@ issions in politics and administration , for neg@@ ligence , especially among the owners , who does not want to dul@@ les the train . &quot;
&quot; so hill de@@ cep@@ ted , looking for new space - now with the form of design and application for building permit . &quot;
&quot; the approval will go in October , the first simil@@ arity of Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now published in children and youth . &quot;
&quot; I hope that this year has happened since visible , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it should be started without &quot; &quot; more comm@@ enc@@ ement &quot; &quot; with the work at former indoor swimming pool . &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fied commitment to refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B strength@@ ens its commitment to refugees to 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga sets the weekend a significant sign . &quot;
the football is respon@@ ding to the sec@@ uring situation in Germany and ensures the policy on how to deal with the challenges of the upcoming problems .
&quot; I think it is the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; there can be no one in principle no one thing , that knows me nothing , I have nothing to do with that . &quot;
&quot; this must be interested every individual to get a grip on this topic , &quot; said DF@@ B @-@ Chef Wolfgang N@@ ier@@ s@@ bach . &quot;
the annual meeting with Chanc@@ ellor Angela Merkel held on 23 September in Berlin he wants to intensi@@ fy the re@@ fuge@@ e situation in Germany .
&quot; I &apos;m the next Wednesday in the ch@@ anc@@ ellor , and tre@@ ats there the Prime Minister Ms E@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the ch@@ anc@@ ellor . &quot;
&quot; there will certainly play a central role , he announced . &quot;
the football could help and wants to help .
but the decisive points must be put in politics .
the German football sector has therefore expanded its re@@ fuge@@ e &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; about four years .
&quot; on the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation , we en@@ sured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; explained N@@ ier@@ s@@ bach at the edge of the U@@ EF@@ A conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
also some states support this program .
already on this weekend the 36 distingu@@ ishing returns a significant sign when it is on the left Tri@@ kot@@ or@@ mel place of the otherwise usual Sponsor@@ en@@ logos ( Her@@ mes ) to implement the print &quot; We help - # Re@@ fuge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help us where and how they can only &quot; , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ us@@ ens Sport@@ i Völ@@ ler of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and marked the project as &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ fuge@@ e drama , everyone goes to everyone , no must notice . &quot;
&quot; we are able to so@@ ccer le@@ lig@@ ent@@ ists , no , we must use our radi@@ ance , our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have already been so incredibly successful to help , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
Hoff@@ en@@ hei@@ ms Managing Director Peter ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot;
&quot; for EM @-@ Quali@@ fying game against Hungary on this Friday , the national team invites people 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot;
N@@ ier@@ s@@ bach was supporting the support of refugees as a &quot; a major community of German football . &quot;
&quot; that every 36 Lic@@ ens@@ ers had started their own projects in their places , be great . &quot;
&quot; just as great , small and smallest clubs are there active . &quot;
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; that we have spent is lived in football .
&quot; it is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this year and next year , the association is working together with the DF@@ B choice and the federal government respectively , 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have already called the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; reported N@@ ier@@ s@@ bach . &quot;
reports : SAP @-@ pre @-@ f@@ ef receives an eye on accident
&quot; the committee of Europe &apos;s leading software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has lost several reports from the over@@ throw in early July the left eye . &quot;
&quot; after the accident at the stair@@ case in the house of his brother in the U.S. , he fell after midnight at a glass , which he saw in the left hand , the &quot; &quot; Business Week &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost gl@@ ut@@ ed , was impot@@ ent , then came out of tow@@ ed to the road - this has told us so the last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Where &quot; SAP @-@ co @-@ founder of the Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; however , Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could be able to do with his work . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the super@@ visory board in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot;
the 54 years old manager was present in the meeting and &quot; fully work . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thurs@@ day@@ run@@ ning@@ side ) will come back to Germany in October and further to the software of the software .
&quot; I am full for SAP da , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I have a whole time in regular contact with the Super@@ visory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t der &quot; SZ . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t comm@@ utes usually between Germany and the USA since the summer it was no longer in the German SAP controller in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; it was important to go with such a personal story to the public , said the manager at the &quot; &quot; SZ / &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; anyone can happen that something . &quot;
important is to be re@@ achable back if one is executed .
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ Roll@@ in magn@@ us@@ or except so@@ fi@@ ery ...
&quot; Magn@@ us@@ sen cir@@ cuits , a corresponding picture and explained , he saw the injury , when he is trou@@ bled from the wheel . &quot;
&quot; he therefore works in Singapore at the weekend as much as reservoir for the two tribe of Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and Jen@@ son Button in@@ question , as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan . &quot;
football : BV@@ B without rec@@ us against Kras@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ auer in the Tor
with Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund you lost all the hopes of a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group of group of the Europe League .
the nation @-@ player becomes a table leader of the so@@ ccer le@@ ague as well as in the Du@@ ell with the F@@ K Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 o &apos;clock / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately , we cannot draw it back to him , &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether Re@@ us will be open again on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ top@@ spiel against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B @-@ Coach is open : &quot; we reck@@ on with a return of him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in light of the high strain of his professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its headquarters in the Re@@ us position . &quot;
so he announced a change on the door@@ ke@@ e@@ position .
that &apos;s why the Roman ham@@ mond takes the place of tri@@ ke@@ eper Roman br@@ ki .
&quot; he trained on an absolute top @-@ level , &quot; pra@@ ised the football @-@ master the world master . &quot;
&quot; whether it comes to use in all Europe @-@ le@@ ague play for use , Tu@@ ch@@ el did however open . &quot;
with high pro@@ bability he will also pass the second game ride .
&quot; the for@@ ge statement of fellow @-@ players Re@@ us that the fin@@ al@@ yst for the BV@@ B is the goal to be the goal , holding funding player Julian W@@ eig@@ l for understand@@ able : &quot; &quot; therefore Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; I think we have a good chance to access the title . &quot;
Robot@@ er@@ auto@@ s : government wants the cutting edge for Germany
Germany shall be according to the will of the Federal Government on the change of cars of technological leader .
&quot; the Federal cor@@ ro@@ eton decided on Wednesday a Strateg@@ i@@ ep@@ ap@@ ier from the house of Verkehrs@@ minister Alexander do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( C@@ SU ) , which among other investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Autom@@ esse I@@ AA from a &quot; new mobile business era . &quot;
automated and net@@ worked driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less stress said it do@@ br@@ ind@@ ed .
he wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states who also address the I@@ AA in the industry with representatives of the industry .
the Strateg@@ i@@ ep@@ ap@@ ier of the firm jointly emphas@@ ises the importance of the mobile broad@@ band out@@ look and of a generous revol@@ ving on digital radio .
the testing of new technology currently arises a test route on highway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; with the driver &quot; &quot; no additional liability @-@ ups &quot; , &quot; the federal government wants to check the legal framework conditions and , where necessary to adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; thus , Germany itself wants to stand for about international that the per@@ mis@@ sible maximum speed of 10 to 130 St@@ und@@ et@@ ometer is raised up . &quot;
the German government will also stand up for a change from the Vienna Convention so far only to make people as a driver .
&quot; with automated driving , the car takes over the lead , the driver becomes more and more for passenger . &quot;
&quot; the technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras , capture the environment and process the data in sec@@ ondary . &quot;
according to one of the German Federal Ministry of Economic study will be highly automated driving on motor@@ ways up to 2020 .
&quot; nevertheless , the vehicles det@@ ected vehicles to be expected only far from 2020 . &quot;
the added @-@ value on the range of timet@@ ers systems and the high @-@ automated driving functions at the German site will appreciate the authors of the study for 2025 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; the digital connectivity of the car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; said the SPD @-@ traffic activities S@@ ör@@ en Bart@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in acci@@ dents and the security of personal data of the driver must be clari@@ fied but clearly clari@@ fied . &quot;
still the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are sc@@ ep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
&quot; one on Wednesday at the AA vor@@ ed survey of the For@@ sa @-@ Institute on behalf of the audi@@ tors DE@@ KR@@ A comes to the result , that only eight percent of German people believe in the coming ten years , 32 percent believe in the coming ten years only , 31 percent believe not in it . &quot;
in France 21 percent of respon@@ dents to 2025 with autonom@@ ous driving cars in the US are 33 percent .
&quot; anyway , the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to leave itself completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; after a collection of Dig@@ ital@@ ing B@@ IT@@ KO@@ M , only seven percent agree to complete control during the entire trip on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the highway that you can still think about 15 percent in the flowing circulation , at least 15 per cent . &quot;
good every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team@@ - and a double @-@ start at pong @-@ EM
the variety of dor@@ fer wants to stand in the single step after the current state from September 25 to October 4 .
the final decision will be closed at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; this is a giant loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough , even without Timo den Tit@@ le , &quot; said Bun@@ destag Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ ner during the EM @-@ teaching in Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ oll was at this time on the flight over a long @-@ term posted , as well as in China . &quot;
the 34 years old German Master will be expected on Friday .
&quot; without Timo is the dis@@ advantage , we are now no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; &quot; Single @-@ Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who guides the S@@ etz@@ board in J@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , but also rem@@ ind@@ ed of the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Timo was also lack@@ ing , and we have become Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; we should focus on ourselves , &quot; explained the cat@@ int@@ ran@@ ch @-@ fifth . &quot;

the first diagnosis clear@@ ed by the 20 year old fellow @-@ player from Bas@@ tian to a sh@@ in break .
G@@ aul@@ tier feels too old for a wom@@ b .
it is a mixture of very large fashion show and a wax@@ ing pres@@ et : the designer Jean Paul G@@ aul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins which are hor@@ ri@@ ble thanks to vide@@ opro@@ j@@ ections .
&quot; they wear the spectacular cre@@ ations of the French designer , who was among other things with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits to the big star of the mod@@ est scene - and so that he did men into tube . &quot;
&quot; I can no longer say that I am the n@@ ant of the Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; formerly it was hor@@ ri@@ ble , meanwhile it is real , &quot; said G@@ aul@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From pav@@ ement to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from the 18th September at the Kuns@@ thalle the hyp@@ o @-@ Cultural Foundation , it is a good luck that the mo@@ ot@@ ters has changed his initial attitude to a show over his person . &quot;
&quot; actually , he had been against it , for : &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition a bit after death , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if you die , one gets into the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously made the Canadian Montreal and Paris station earlier .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful gar@@ ments , &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger &quot;
&quot; it comes to tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits do not give an insight into the barely visible work of the man , the mo@@ de@@ history , without ever completed a training . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ olog@@ ically the show is not built , but it is a great chore@@ ograp@@ hed overall competition for which much effort has been run : to refres@@ h the doll@@ s , for example , is a sty@@ list is dedicated . &quot;
14 tons of material made the fe@@ eders according to the data of the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxi@@ me L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
just before the start of the Ok@@ tober@@ fest there was still a special shel@@ ter : a leder@@ h@@ osen out@@ fit with cor@@ s@@ ett .
Heidi meets Madonna .
&quot; he has always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; women are &quot; &quot; men &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , said G@@ aul@@ tier . &quot;
also G@@ aul@@ ti@@ ers &apos; old Teddy is seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , pr@@ ag@@ ous tal@@ ents of the designer . &quot;
as a child ( he was not a good student and poor in football ) he was attracted to his Teddy B@@ H@@ s and Dres@@ ses , said G@@ aul@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; to play with a pupp@@ et , his parents would not have allowed to him . &quot;
the thro@@ wing of fashion he wrote later on .
he stahl Mo@@ de@@ ay@@ ings and saw the designs of other designers like G@@ aul@@ tier in Munich .
&quot; later , I bought this . &quot;
for his first own fashion show he cannot pay the Models .
&quot; they got nothing , but was allowed to keep the cl@@ ots . &quot;
jewelry instead of she@@ er - plat@@ former tip as fashion @-@ ni@@ che
&quot; earlier , it went to the long Sti@@ ck@@ ery in and around pl@@ ung@@ es about it , meters to make . &quot;
embro@@ i@@ dered substances and tips were produced in large quantity for customers including for example to blank@@ ets and she@@ ers .
&quot; this alone does not work anymore , Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the Mod@@ ps Pl@@ auen . &quot;
instead the fashion is important .
&quot; in the initial hours of the pl@@ au@@ ti@@ st tip mode played a larger role , then it was displac@@ ed by the home industry and is now shown as ni@@ che . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : tip in jewelry , with accessories such as bags and at regional trails . &quot;
&quot; in general the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Vintage @-@ Mode &quot; , &quot; which appeared in past step@@ le@@ po@@ chen , an increasing adult . &quot;
those who are not served in the textile industry in Germany is no longer available on the market .
we have already made up half of all orders .
Mod@@ esp@@ lit Pl@@ auen is a member of nine further companies member in the branch of pl@@ ung@@ sten tip and embro@@ ider@@ ies .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
some 80 percent of revenues have been displac@@ ed in the last 15 years .
private experts and wholesale trade shows there is almost no more .
our products can hardly achieve our products in this ways .
the mass ware is produced a lot cheaper nowadays in the Asian region and is almost exclusively distributed by chains .
&quot; the weak@@ ening of the export , currently to Russia and the USA . &quot;
so enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; industry Association also attempts to focus through environmental awareness , such as Cor@@ dula Bauer from the Sti@@ ck@@ per@@ le explained in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; since this year we perform a quality sa@@ il , that shows that we produce ecological and soci@@ ally di@@ arr@@ ative . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this refers to the materials used .
diplom@@ a in U@@ te Schmidt instruc@@ t at the Snow@@ drop of the West@@ Sax@@ on University of Zwickau - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and is speci@@ alised in embro@@ ider@@ ies and tips .
&quot; in order to use the competition from the Asian region , you need to find high quality and innovative products . &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; arising a voltage between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the fact@@ ories that must be understood mainly economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design is often only vari@@ ated , in order to keep a customer @-@ down . &quot;
a couple of years ago with celeb@@ rating textile design ner@@ in Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter the historical snow @-@ pointed new .
the machine extended to some places small kit@@ chens .
the Pl@@ ume gold @-@ Championship in Bianca Hall@@ eb@@ ach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ght left out of it : &quot; formerly I could do nothing with traditional pl@@ ung@@ er tip . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball top for her jewelry .
in a elabor@@ ate process they character@@ iz@@ es the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people of the region identify with the topic of pl@@ ung@@ sten tip - young and old , &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies in the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers who want to live their ancestors in pl@@ agues and surroundings . &quot;
I see my jewelry as a modern amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors of the Pl@@ ung@@ ener tip .

&quot; according to &quot; &quot; Entertainment Weekly &quot; &quot; however , it is not a curi@@ osity , but a kind of continuation of which 20 years after the first film is played with the magical children &apos;s ma@@ ids . &quot;
it is about the experience of the N@@ anny family with the family Banks in times of the world economy in England .
