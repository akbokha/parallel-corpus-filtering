in the form of a stamp between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ inian Republic over the trade with H@@ amm@@ el and L@@ amm@@ ers
&quot; I honour me , on the recent negotiations between our delegations on the import of H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community relating to the application of the Common Market Organisation for sheep and goat meat . in the course of these negotiations the two parties as follows : &quot;
&quot; - fresh or cool@@ ed H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ; ) ; &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , the export options for H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat from Argentina are set to the following annual amount : 20 000 tons , expressed in battle body weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; to ensure a flaw@@ less functioning of the agreement is oblig@@ ated to ensure Argentina , by appropriate procedure ensuring that the advanced amount did not sur@@ pass the agreed quantity , and executed in accordance with conventional supply forms ( frozen or cool@@ ed ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change of supply form as a result of changes in technology and trade in trading , the two parties of this agreement will consult each other before introducing such a change in the number 10 mentioned below to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community takes the protective clause , they oblig@@ ated to bear the concern that in this agreement , the access of Argentina to the Community market will not be touched . &quot;

the con@@ fu@@ sions for these new Member States will be determined according to the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this is taken into account under number 5 named Ho@@ ech@@ al &apos;s set of exhaus@@ tion .
&quot; the total amount will be determined by the day of the accession of Greece to the community on 23 000 tons of the body weight , with the day of the accession of Greece . &quot;
the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development which could interfere with the marketing of Argent@@ inian H@@ amm@@ el and amphi@@ bian on the Community market within the agreed amounts .
&quot; in particular the Community measures , so that the sales of intervention stocks of frozen meat due to the implementation of the regulation of Argent@@ in@@ gian h@@ amm@@ uni@@ tion , and lam@@ bs do not under@@ mines . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and regulations of this agreement , the community agreed that every actual application of equipment and lam@@ bs is made only at prices and conditions , which are in line with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community at world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms are in a way out which is compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular article 10 paragraph 2 letter c ) of the Convention for interpretation and application of the article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of general inch and trade agreement . &quot;
Argentina ensures compliance with this agreement in particular that it has been issued within this agreement with the quantity of export licenses for the number of products referred to under number 1 .
&quot; the community is committed to meet all necessary measures , so that the provision of authorised products for pre @-@ mentioned products is made dependent on the template of a export license which is issued in charge by the Argent@@ in@@ ean government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system will be determined that the position of a security deposit for the issu@@ ance of the authorised products can be avoided .
&quot; in order @-@ to @-@ end @-@ regulations , the competent authority of the competent authority of the responsible body has been granted in regular intervals to the competent authority of the responsible body , for the export licenses , these data may be in@@ conclu@@ sive to identification country . &quot;
the committee contributes to it that the agreement is applied properly and worked smoothly .
&quot; he regularly checks the tendency on the H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat market of both parties and on the world market , as well as the sales conditions on these markets including conditions , which are of importance to the number 7 mentioned above . &quot;
&quot; the Committee carries out that the proper application of this agreement is not affected by this , that products from H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat under the agreement will not be executed under the agreement . &quot;
the committee discussed all questions concerning the implementation of these agreements and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this agreement are char@@ geable to the rights and obligations of the parties in the context of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the amount of year set is valid for the time from 1 January to 31 .
&quot; the amount paid by the entry into force of this agreement until 1 . January of the following year , quantity is determined in proportion to the total @-@ year volume and carries the seasonal character of trade . &quot;
&quot; this agreement applies to the territories in which the contract is applied to the establishment of the European Economic Community , and on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina . &quot;
&quot; it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after that time it remains in force , subject to the right of every party to cancel it by one year in writing . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the provisions of this agreement will be reviewed by the two parties before the 1 . April 1984 with regard to changes that need to be understandable to it . &quot;

in the form of a stamp between the European Economic Community and the Eastern Republic of Uruguay on the trade with H@@ amm@@ el and L@@ amm@@ ers
&quot; I honour me , on the recent negotiations between our delegations on the import of H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the Common Market Organisation for sheep and goat meat . in the course of these negotiations the two parties are as follows : &quot;
&quot; - fresh or cool@@ ed H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat ( Tari@@ f@@ site 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) of the Common Cust@@ oms Tari@@ ff ; &quot;
&quot; - frozen H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat ( Tari@@ f@@ place 02.@@ 01 A IV b ) of the Common Cust@@ oms Tari@@ ff . &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , the export options for H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay are set to the following annual amount : &quot;
&quot; to ensure a flaw@@ less functioning of the agreement , Uruguay , due to appropriate procedure ensure that the advanced amount did not sur@@ pass the agreed quantity , and executed in accordance with conventional supply forms ( frozen or cool@@ ed ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change of supply form as a result of changes in technology and trade in trading , the two parties of this agreement will consult each other before introducing such a change in the number 10 mentioned below to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community takes the protective clause , they oblig@@ ate themselves to bear the concern that in this agreement has failed access to the common market of the common market . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the inser@@ ting from Uruguay in one year passed the agreed amounts , the community reserves the right to expose the income from Uruguay to the rest of the year . &quot;
the community is committed to restrict the exhaus@@ tion on the inser@@ tion of this agreement to a high degree from 10 v.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; with the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Uruguay changes the number 2 fixed amount according to the scope of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an trade with each new Member State . &quot;
the con@@ fu@@ sions for these new Member States will be determined according to the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this is taken into account under number 5 named Ho@@ ech@@ al &apos;s set of exhaus@@ tion .
&quot; the total amount specified under number 2 is determined by the day of the accession of Greece to the community at 5 800 tons of the body weight . &quot;
&quot; the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development , which could interfere with the marketing ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an H@@ amm@@ el and amphi@@ bian on the Community market within the agreed amounts . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the Community measures , so that the sales of intervention stocks of frozen meat due to the implementation of the regulation of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ ish creations are not under@@ mined . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and regulations of this agreement , the community agreed that every actual application of equipment and lam@@ bs is made only at prices and conditions , which are in line with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community at world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms are in a way out which is compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular article 10 paragraph 2 letter c ) of the Convention for interpretation and application of the article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of general inch and trade agreement . &quot;
&quot; Uruguay ensures compliance with this agreement , in particular , that it has been issued within this agreement with the quantity of export licenses for the number of products referred to under number 1 . &quot;
&quot; the community is committed to meet all necessary measures , so that the provision of authorised products with origin in Uruguay is made dependent on the submission of a export license which is issued in charge by the ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ ischen government . &quot;
&quot; in order @-@ to @-@ end @-@ regulations , the competent authority of the competent authority of the community at the competent point of the community will be claimed ; these data may be charged according to identification country . &quot;
&quot; this agreement applies to the territories in which the contract is applied to the establishment of the European Economic Community , on the one hand and the territory of the Republic of Eastern Europe on the other . &quot;
&quot; it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after that time it remains in force , subject to the right of any party to cancel it by one year in writing . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the provisions of this agreement will be reviewed by the two parties before the 1 . April 1984 with regard to changes that they need to be needed . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would confirm your government with this writing .

&quot; the blood decrease is as@@ ep@@ tic ; the blood is derived from a closed , steri@@ le tube system in a steri@@ le bottle , in which the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans@@ as has been fu@@ elled before the death . &quot;
&quot; after ending the blood@@ shed , the bottle is immediately to close and cool to a temperature of 4 C up to 6 C . afterwards , it may only be opened immediately before the use of the blood . &quot;
&quot; Men@@ gen@@ otypes may not be more than 220 ml per liter of human blood than 220 ml per liter of human blood cells , and the hem@@ o@@ glo@@ bin@@ centr@@ ation may not be subject to 97 g per liter . &quot;
the blood @-@ group after the A @-@ B @-@ 0 system is previously due to hand the blood cells and the ser@@ um ; the determination of the R@@ h factor is carried out by examining the blood cells at a new sample of the spinal blood .
&quot; as far as for the blood group@@ ing in individual countries , or recommended procedures there are , these apply . &quot;
&quot; the designation R@@ h @-@ negative is only to be used , if specific investigations the non @-@ existing means of the anti@@ gens C , D , you and E have revealed . &quot;
&quot; according to this agreement , the blood for this agreement shall only be used for recipients of the corresponding AB @-@ 0 @-@ group . &quot;
&quot; the human thorough@@ ble@@ t is in ster@@ iler , swal@@ lowed bottle of micro@@ organisms , and to keep up to his use on a temperature of 4 to 6 C ; higher temperatures are allowed only during the examination and transport of necessary times , where the blood can be switched back to 4 to 6 C immediately . &quot;
a concentration of human red blood cells is a unity of human bloody blood that has been removed from which the largest part of the plasma has been removed .
it contains all red blood cells of unity from which it has been won ; other blood cells can be present or may be partially removed .
&quot; the liquid content of the concentration consists of either the remaining plasma or from a suitable is@@ ot@@ onic artificial solution , which was placed after removal of the plastic . &quot;
&quot; the volume of the red blood cells shall be between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product ; however , a higher concentration of red blood cells is used , so is the approximate percentage of the er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tic volume ( ha@@ em@@ ok@@ r@@ it ) on the label . &quot;
&quot; all processes need to be carried out under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions and must take place under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions , using a steri@@ le , closed system and only through pressure . &quot;
&quot; if an artificial @-@ water solution has been placed , so on the label also contains their volume and composition . &quot;
&quot; the human dry plasma is extracted from de@@ hydr@@ ation of the liquid , resulting in cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ gi@@ ation or sedi@@ mentation of human blood . &quot;
&quot; the human dry plasma is generated by refriger@@ ation , or any other method , by which a den@@ atur@@ ation of proteins is avoided . &quot;
the dry product can be easily applied in a water quantity that matches the liquid amount from which one went out in the manufacture of the substance .
&quot; the protein concentrations of such a solution must not be less than 45 g per liter , and the solution may not be the visible sign of hem@@ y@@ se@@ products . &quot;
donations to which ( using a fresh feed sample ) have been established a dangerous salary of I@@ so@@ h@@ amm@@ ol@@ y@@ sin or immune her@@ mag@@ glut@@ in@@ ine .
&quot; if the plasma is not mixed up within 48 hours of blood removal and frozen , the ster@@ ility of each unit must be proven in a blood amount of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; to turn off the damaging effects of bacterial products in the plasma , blood don@@ ors may not use blood pressure ; the ster@@ ility of every donation must be proven in a blood amount of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; to dimin@@ ish the risk of transmission of I@@ no@@ kul@@ ation@@ shep@@ atitis , are to conce@@ al compounds that are not more than 12 don@@ ors , or other methods which are known to put this danger down in a comparable way . &quot;
&quot; one of the liquid quantity , from which you went out in the production of plasma , corresponding water quantity ; the substance must be fully resolved within 10 minutes from 15 to 20 C . &quot;
&quot; a given Qu@@ antum plasma is dissolved in the amount of water the liquid quantity , from which it was produced , the solution will be subjected to the following tests : &quot;
&quot; one uses 1 ml solution to sufficient amount Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in or calcium chlor@@ inated , then the process can be accelerated in the brood @-@ oven at 37 C . &quot;
&quot; due to the 24@@ h drying process in the presence of phosph@@ or@@ th@@ pent@@ ine in the presence of phosph@@ osph@@ or@@ pent@@ ine , in the presence of phosph@@ osph@@ or@@ pent@@ ine , may not occur in the human dry plasma loss over 0,5 % . &quot;
&quot; human dry plasma is stored in a nit@@ rogen atmosphere or in the air @-@ empty space in a ster@@ il@@ en , swal@@ lowed bottle of all micro@@ organisms , and by possibility of any humidity ; it is light to protect and to hold on a temperature below 20 C . &quot;
human Alb@@ um@@ ine and fac@@ tions made of human Plas@@ m@@ ap@@ rot@@ an are preparations made of the protein component from which approximately 60 % of the total prot@@ otyp@@ ing of the human blood flow .
&quot; without regard to whether the end product can be flu@@ ke or dry , it must be heated to 60 C ± 0.5 C ± 0.5 C ± 0.5 C ± 0.5 C ± 0.5 C ± 0.5 C ± 0.5 C ± 0.5 C . &quot;
&quot; in preparation of human being , at least 95 % of the mass of the existing proteins , can be changed . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , no more than 10 mg immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ulin G may be present per gram of the product . &quot;
&quot; if the end product is free@@ ze , it must contain at least 950 mg protein per gram of the product . &quot;
&quot; the Group from the human Plas@@ m@@ ap@@ ron is produced as a solution , it must have a total prot@@ ein@@ centr@@ ation between 45 and 50 g per liter . &quot;
&quot; human album is manufactured as a solution , it must have a total prot@@ ein@@ centr@@ ation of at least 45 g per liter . &quot;
&quot; compar@@ es of vis@@ cos@@ ity and clou@@ ding as well as cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges with the Ultra@@ cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge and electro@@ ph@@ or@@ ese , which are made in front of and after the heat to the solutions , no sign of a den@@ atur@@ ation of the sol@@ dering proteins can be revealed . &quot;
&quot; after the heat on 57 C and six @-@ stage pup@@ il , in a mechanical foam device at this temperature , the solution must be completely free from visible particles . &quot;
I ) The counterf@@ eit tests with specific anti@@ sera have to show that in both preparations only human plasma is included ;
&quot; the electro@@ ph@@ or@@ ese is represented by fre@@ ish@@ ful particles under engaging and suitable conditions , the protagonist , which possesses the mot@@ ility of normal human plasma , in preparation of at least 95 % and in preparations made by fac@@ tions from human Plas@@ m@@ ap@@ rot@@ a at least 85 % of the protein mass . &quot;
&quot; in other preparations from the nation @-@ Alb@@ um@@ ine and in groups of human plasma @-@ red rot@@ ary , the sodium con@@ centric 0.@@ 15 mo@@ l per liter solution or re@@ her@@ able Tro@@ k@@ ken@@ nel may not exceed . &quot;
the calibr@@ ation of the fac@@ tions of human plastic rot@@ ary must not exceed 2 m@@ mo@@ l per liter solution or re@@ her@@ ded dry season .
&quot; the pH @-@ value of each preparations has to contain a protein concentrations of 10 g per liter with a solution that includes 0,@@ 15 mo@@ l Cali@@ um@@ chl@@ oride per liter , at a measuring temperature of 15 to 25 C 6.@@ 8 ± 0,@@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; due to the 24@@ h drying process in the presence of phosph@@ or@@ rhe@@ a , under pressure from a maximum 0.@@ 02 mm mer@@ cury , may not occur in the dry che@@ ating weight loss over 0,5 % . &quot;
human dry bo@@ be@@ ine is in a nit@@ rogen atmosphere or in the air @-@ empty space in a steri@@ le , fixed container under tender of micro@@ organisms and from the possibility of moisture to store ; it is light to protect and keep on a temperature below 20 C .
&quot; solutions from the nation @-@ Alb@@ um@@ ine and fac@@ tions made of human Plas@@ m@@ ap@@ rot@@ a are in ster@@ il@@ ar , conce@@ aled containers under the committees of micro@@ organisms . they are to be protected against light and to hold on a temperature of 4 to 6 C . &quot;
the label on the container contains all the information contained in the corresponding mu@@ ff@@ ett ( system 4 ) .
&quot; the normal human immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ulin is a feature made from plastic rot@@ ary , which was produced from human , the antibodies of normal adul@@ thood . &quot;
&quot; the applied manufacturing method has to ensure that the end product does not exceed the conditions described below , and does not support I@@ no@@ cul@@ ation shep@@ herds . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the manufacturing method has to ensure that the antibodies contained in the product product are concentrated in sufficient amounts . &quot;
the method is satisfactory for any rate in this respect if in the initial and end product antibodies for at least one virus and a bacterial tox@@ in .
&quot; during the production , no anti@@ sep@@ tic or bacterial substance must be placed ; to ensure the bacterial ster@@ ility and the stability of the final product , can give it a suitable preser@@ vatives and an appropriate stabil@@ isation of stabil@@ isation . &quot;
the end product is delivered as a solution whose immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ in@@ con@@ centr@@ ation must be between 100 and 170 g per liter .

a re@@ agen@@ z to the blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples that contain the an@@ tigen that contains the anti@@ body or another on the label used hom@@ olo@@ gue .
&quot; a re@@ agen@@ z is used in the form recommended by the manufacturer , so the following factors or appar@@ itions do not occur : a ) h@@ ub@@ y@@ tic properties ; &quot;
the title is measured by getting re @-@ di@@ lution of the re@@ warding re@@ car to the double in a suitable medium .
&quot; the Tit@@ er is the recipro@@ cal value of the number of strongest ser@@ um fertili@@ zation , in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated exclusively in the volume of blood cells in the total volume . &quot;
&quot; for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents that are supposed to be used to object , the activity is expressed by the time that is required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object bearer . &quot;
the World Health Organization has set up for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood @-@ regulation International norms and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are developed at the time standards .
&quot; according to definition , it contains a specific number of inter @-@ national units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the Tit@@ ans that are observed in single preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
( 1 ) The effectiveness of the re@@ agents to the blood group control of most specific@@ ity is expressed as a Ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ary that is observed in a series of dil@@ uted by er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ presses .
the title gives the di@@ lution of the reproduction in the last mixture within a series when a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic visible aggreg@@ ated appearance occurs .
&quot; the effectiveness of the re@@ agents to the blood group , for the International standard super@@ visor ( in the time of anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) , may be expressed on the basis of the in@@ tim@@ eliness of un@@ familiar re@@ agents in comparison to the International standard feature or in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; if one brings them back to a volume of 1 ml , so the anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B S@@ eren contain 256 International units per ml . &quot;

the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ car in flu@@ essi@@ ger shape according to the label is most effective one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ ir@@ ation date for dry re@@ agents depends on the results of the shelf @-@ testing ; it is backed by the governmental authorities .
&quot; dry re@@ agents are kept in an atmosphere of in@@ ated gas or in a vacuum , in which they have dried up and that is shut up , that no moisture can enter . &quot;
a dry re@@ agen@@ z may lose at the most 0,5 v.@@ H. of his weight if it is tested by further drying via Ph@@ osph@@ or@@ pent@@ ine at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm H@@ g within 24 hours .
&quot; to prevent bacterial growth , the competent authority can determine that the re@@ agen@@ z ( or with the dry re@@ agents supplied sol@@ vents ) have been added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided the re@@ agen@@ z with the added substance continue to fu@@ ck the requirements of specific@@ ity and effectiveness . &quot;

&quot; for the international exchange rate specific re@@ agents to the blood group , as such as cannot be artificial , at least as long as not as long as an International Convention on a uniform system has come about . &quot;
&quot; re@@ agents at the blood group control are in such a way and in such quantities , that that in a container is not only to carry out tests using the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells . &quot;
&quot; the quantity must be so large in a container , that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol . &quot;
the manufacturer collabor@@ ates on all production levels and controls of re@@ agents to result in blood @-@ regulation written records .
&quot; proper samples of all re@@ agents entered are so long been accepted by the laboratory , until with some likelihood may be assumed that the batch will no longer be used . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ agents used for the blood group of determination can contain substances human , animal , vegetable ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these constitute the effective share , the others are the necessary tools to reinforce the effectiveness and maintaining the stability of the reconstruction . &quot;
&quot; for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are divided into three groups according to the source of their effective proportions . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain strictly substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ agents can contain no substances of human origin . &quot;
&quot; on each individual container is a black on white printed label in English and French , the following information contains : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer , &quot;

I allow myself to propose the following agreement as a basis for cooperation between the European Economic Community and the International Council for marine research .
&quot; 1 . the European Economic Community , represented by its Commission , is named &quot; &quot; Council &quot; , &quot; to ask recommendations concerning the management of fish stocks and related questions , and the Council will come as far as possible . &quot;
&quot; 2 . on the agenda of the Commission &apos;s responsibility in the management of fish stocks , the Council agreed to submit all the relevant reports of its work groups to assess the inventory , as well as reports of its advisory fishing committee . &quot;
&quot; 3 . the Council and the Commission are regularly advised to intensify the cooperation between the two parties , and in particular the possibilities of examining the Commission to establish a closer link to the Advisory Board of fisheries . &quot;
&quot; 4 . the community will pay a sum of 3@@ 76 000 d@@ k@@ r , and pay annual payments at the signing of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the annual fee will not contain the costs of meetings , which will be conven@@ ed by the Commission on special request . &quot;
5 . three years after the agreement of this agreement the provisions of both parties are once again examined .
&quot; no new provisions will be agreed , so extends the agreement on the basis of existing provisions until new agreements have been negotiated . &quot;
&quot; every party at all times has the welfare , under compliance with one @-@ year period of notice of the agreement . &quot;
&quot; with regard to Klau@@ sel 3 , the Council agreed to recognize a scientific representative of the Commission to recognise the observer status in meetings of the Council &apos;s Advisory Committee for fisheries management . &quot;
