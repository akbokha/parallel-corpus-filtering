the present document is a summary of the European Public Health Administration report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) in which explains how the Committee for Human@@ itarian Sciences ( CH@@ MP ) has been judged to make recommendations concerning the application of drug .
&quot; if you need more information about your disease or its treatment , please read the package ( also component of the E@@ PA@@ R ) or contact your doctor or a pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as a 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of melting ( tablets , which dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for inser@@ tion ( 1 mg / ml ) and as injection solution ( 7,5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. wir@@ res thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing of things that are not present ) , mis@@ trust and ins@@ isting ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental disorder , in which the patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods abnormal up@@ surge ) alternat@@ ely with periods of normal mood . &quot;
&quot; A@@ bili@@ fy will be applied to the treatment of moderate to severe Man@@ ical episodes and the prevention of Man@@ ical episodes in patients , who have addressed the drug in the past . &quot;
the injection solution is applied to fast control of t@@ apped anxiety or behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces when the or@@ ale intake of the drug is not possible .
&quot; both diseases can take the solution to the inser@@ tion , or the melting pot in patients may be prepared , causing tablets trouble . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time , the same as A@@ bili@@ fy , should be adapted to the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; this affects the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters &quot; , i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells each other . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole seems probably mainly as a &quot; partial ag@@ onist for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ lo@@ yp@@ tam@@ in ( also known ser@@ otonin ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ lo@@ yp@@ tam@@ in and dop@@ amine , but in less dimensions than the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters affect to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; da dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ lo@@ yp@@ tam@@ in at schizophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , carries Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thus reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy , to prevent re@@ activity of symptoms , was investigated in three studies over up to a year . &quot;
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared to two studies in 8@@ 05 patients with schizophren@@ ia or similar diseases which were compared to a placebo over a period of two hours .
&quot; in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was tested over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with p@@ operated dol , in another study the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy and placebo , in another study the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy and placebo , in which the Ottoman symptoms have already been stabil@@ ised with A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared to a study of 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that were raised by Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
&quot; in all studies , the changes in the symptoms of the patients were examined using a standard sc@@ ala for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients studied in the treatment of treatment . &quot;
the company also conducted studies in order to examine how the body absor@@ bs the melting pot and the solution for inser@@ tion .
&quot; in both studies with the injection solution patients showed A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5,@@ 25 mg , 9.5 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms imp@@ aired as the patients who received a placebo . &quot;
when used to treat the bi@@ polar disorder decreased A@@ bili@@ fy in four of the five short @-@ time studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than placebo .
&quot; A@@ bili@@ fy prevented also up to 74 weeks of effective , up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the re@@ acting of Man@@ ischer episodes before previously treated patients and if it has been administered in addition to an existing treatment . &quot;
A@@ bili@@ fy injections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses decreased also more effective than placebo the symptoms stri@@ cken and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side @-@ effects of A@@ bili@@ fy to take ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extr@@ ap@@ pyramid , aci@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( im@@ pregn@@ ation ) , gran@@ ary ( tre@@ p@@ ation ) , gran@@ ary ( tre@@ p@@ ation ) , gran@@ ary ( tre@@ p@@ ation ) , gran@@ ary ( tre@@ p@@ ation ) , gran@@ ary ( tre@@ p@@ ation ) , gran@@ ary ( tre@@ p@@ ation ) , gran@@ ary ( tre@@ p@@ ation ) , gran@@ ary ( tre@@ p@@ ation ) , gran@@ ary ( tre@@ p@@ ation ) , gran@@ ary ( tre@@ p@@ ation ) , gran@@ ary ( tre@@ p@@ ation ) , gran@@ ary ( tre@@ p@@ ation ) , gran@@ ary ( tre@@ p@@ ation ) , gran@@ ary ( tre@@ p@@ ation ) , gran@@ ary ( tre@@ p@@ ation ) , gran@@ ary ( tre@@ p@@ ation ) , gran@@ ary ( tre@@ p@@ ation ) , gran@@ ary ( tre@@ p@@ ation ) , gran@@ ary ( tre@@ p@@ ation ) , gran@@ ary ( tre@@ p@@ ation ) , gran@@ ary ( tre@@ p@@ ation ) , gran@@ ary ( tre@@ p@@ ation ) , gran@@ ary ( tre@@ p@@ ation ) , gran@@ ary ( tre@@ p@@ ation ) , gran@@ ary ( tre@@ p@@ ation ) , gran@@ ary ( tre@@ p@@ ation ) , gran@@ ary ( tre@@ p@@ ation ) , gran@@ ary ( tre@@ p@@ ation ) , gran@@ ary ( tre@@ p@@ ation ) , gran@@ ary ( tre@@ p@@ ation ) , gran@@ ary ( tre@@ p@@ ation ) , gran@@ ary ( tre@@ p@@ ation ) , gran@@ ary ( tre@@ p@@ ation ) , gran@@ ary ( tre@@ p@@ ation ) , gran@@ ary ( tre@@ p@@ ation ) , gran@@ ary ( tre@@ p@@ ation ) , gran@@ ary ( tre@@ p@@ ation ) , gran@@ ary ( tre@@ p@@ ation ) , gran@@ ary ( tre@@ p@@ ation ) , gran@@ ary ( tre@@ p@@ ation ) , gran@@ ary ( tre@@ p@@ ation ) , gran@@ ary ( tre@@ p@@ ation ) , gran@@ ary ( tre@@ p@@ ation ) , gran@@ ary ( tre@@ p@@ ation ) , gran@@ ary ( tre@@ p@@ ation ) , gran@@ ary ( tre@@ p@@ ation ) , gran@@ ary ( tre@@ p@@ ation ) , gran@@ ary ( tre@@ p@@ ation ) , gran@@ ary ( tre@@ mor ) , gran@@ ary (

&quot; moreover , the committee came to the result that the benefits of the injection solution in patients with schizophren@@ ia or in patients with the German episodes of Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , when an or@@ ale therapy is not suitable to over@@ ride the risks . &quot;
June 2004 the European Commission submitted to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . an approval for the transport of A@@ bili@@ fy in the entire European Union .
&quot; AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe German episodes of the bi@@ polar @-@ I@@ - disorder and for the prevention of a new German episode in patients , which had overwhel@@ m@@ ingly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes of the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a contrac@@ tion of 15 mg / day once daily independently of the meals .
&quot; an increased effectiveness in doses about a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of schizophren@@ ia and Bi@@ polar @-@ I@@ - disorder in patients ≥ 65 years have not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of these patients , a lower initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis should be considered , when clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ duction is derived from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ er@@ z@@ ole @-@ dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
the occurrence of su@@ icide behaviour belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epidemi@@ ological study showed that it was not increased in patients with bi@@ polar disorder .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be applied with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( el@@ yo@@ cardi@@ ac disease , hypo@@ vol@@ an@@ a@@ emia , treatment for hyp@@ ot@@ ony , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with hem@@ ac@@ ular drugs ) or hyper@@ ton@@ ie ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , one year or less , there were occasional reports over during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia . &quot;
&quot; if in one with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the patient treated signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ nasty , should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; when a patient develops signs and symptoms which pointed to a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ otic , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , must be ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be applied in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese or in case of cases which are applied with cl@@ amps , with caution . &quot;
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psych@@ osis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease had patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in comparison to placebo .
&quot; there were , however , in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the contact for unwanted zer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ azi@@ de or death , was reported in patients who were treated with atyp@@ ical anti @-@ psych@@ otic agents , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y . &quot;
there are no precise risk estimates for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related unwanted events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents treated to patients who allow direct comparisons .
&quot; Poly@@ di@@ p@@ es , poly@@ ur@@ ry , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in terms of deterioration of the glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; a weight gain is generally observed in a schizophren@@ ic patient and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia , due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ ous Man@@ ia , in which weight gain is known as a side effect , or may lead to severe complications as well . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advisable when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines with in@@ contin@@ ous side effects such as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 @-@ Ant@@ ler Fam@@ oti@@ din , a stomach acid blo@@ cker , reduces the rem@@ nant rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is not relevant as clin@@ ically . &quot;
in a clinical study with healthy pro@@ ban@@ ds a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased the Au@@ c from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ um 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , like flu@@ ox@@ etine and par@@ ox@@ etine , similar effects , and therefore should be made similar dos@@ ages reduction . &quot;
&quot; at C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; &quot; poor &quot; &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ isi@@ ans may result in higher plasma bit@@ ors by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plas@@ ma@@ con@@ centric compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive Met@@ abol@@ isi@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; if you consider the common usage of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefits should over@@ ride the potential risks to the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and HIV @-@ inflammatory , should have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dos@@ ages reduction . &quot;
&quot; after receipt of the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , the dosage of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be raised to the Dos@@ age levels before the beginning of the companion therapy . &quot;
&quot; dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , can be calculated with a moderate increase in the Ari@@ pi@@ er@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole per day does not have any significant effect on the met@@ adata of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ methodology xy@@ morph@@ in@@ at @-@ rati@@ o ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( war@@ color ) , and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ an ) . &quot;
the patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; due to the insufficient data base for the safety of the people and due to the concerns in the animal studies , this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy unless the potential benefits are clearly made to the potential risk of fo@@ etus . &quot;
&quot; however , as well as in other anti@@ psych@@ otic medication , the patients should be warned of dangerous machinery , including power vehicles , including power vehicles , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on it . &quot;
the following side effects are more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side listed below is defined by the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schizophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study conducted over 52 weeks in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ ar , D@@ yst@@ onie and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ oper@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study , over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients were under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study , over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14,@@ 8 % were treated with patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in therapy . &quot;
man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled study about 12 weeks was the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3.5 % in patients suffering from Ar@@ pi@@ er@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.@@ 3 % in patients under neck dol treatment .
&quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was charged with patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment . &quot;
during the long @-@ term experience period over 26 weeks at a placebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ er@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients with placebo treated patients .
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , during which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratories , revealed no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; increases the CP@@ K ( Krem@@ atin @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of the patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole patients , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; on the side effects that has been reported in connection with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ lep@@ tic syndrome , sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ intended or inten@@ tional acute over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ations were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death succession . &quot;
&quot; although there is no information about the effectiveness of an im@@ modi@@ fying treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole before ; however , it is unlikely that ha@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis is in the treatment of an over@@ dose of benefit , since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plastic rot@@ ary . &quot;
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole at Sch@@ iz@@ ophren@@ ia and Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder on the combination of a partial ag@@ onal effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ - recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed in vit@@ ro a high aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 recep@@ tor , and 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recep@@ tor , and 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a , to the ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to the alpha @-@ 1 in@@ soles and to the hist@@ amine H@@ 1@@ recep@@ tor . &quot;

&quot; in a Hal@@ f dol @-@ controlled study , 52 percent of the share of respon@@ dents who have a reference to the study of study , in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ f dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values of measuring instruments defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depress@@ ants scale , showed a significant stronger better than with Hal@@ f dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study on 26 weeks of stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schizophren@@ ia , for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a significantly higher reduction in return rates , which was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and at 57 % of placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an ox @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study conducted at schizophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients involved in schizophren@@ ia ( N = 18 or 13 % of the value of cost @-@ value patient ) in significantly less patients ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . &quot;
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage with flexible dosage with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole a compared to placebo over placebo over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with a fixed dosage with a fixed or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole towards placebo no exagger@@ ated effectiveness .
&quot; in two plac@@ ements and active mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a German or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene showed a placebo over placebo over a week 3 and a consumer effect , which was comparable to that of lithium or neck dol in week 12 . &quot;
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole also pointed out a comparable share of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the Man@@ ia , such as lithium or neck dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study about 6 weeks with patients with a German or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , which in part 2 weeks not to reflect on li@@ thi@@ um@@ - or Val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeu@@ tical ser@@ um , revealed the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in comparison to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks in German patients , with regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar retrosp@@ ect , predominantly in the prevention of a relap@@ se in the Man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on vit@@ ro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for stretching the N @-@ de@@ ple@@ tion by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 cataly@@ tic . &quot;
&quot; the mean Eli@@ min@@ ation period is nearly 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ag at nearly 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ ising via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and at nearly 14@@ 6 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; &quot; poor &quot; &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ isi@@ ers over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; at Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in the phar@@ mak@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy pro@@ ban@@ ds , as well as showed no gender @-@ dependent patient in a pharmac@@ o@@ cular study . &quot;
a clear evaluation of Phar@@ mak@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics revealed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in ethnic affili@@ ation or the impact of smoking on the Phar@@ m@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ o@@ cular properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and el@@ hydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy pro@@ gangs .
&quot; a single dose study at Pro@@ ban@@ den with a multi @-@ radi@@ ger liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect regarding the impairment of the liver function to the Phar@@ m@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the class C , which is not enough to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on the safety of security , re@@ productive re@@ tention , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and Can@@ cer@@ o@@ genic potential , the pre@@ clinical data cannot recognize any particular dangers to the human being . &quot;

&quot; in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis has been determined as a result of the failure of sul@@ ph@@ ate @-@ con@@ ju@@ jug@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( Au@@ c ) at the recommended clinical dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ fold of the recommended maximum dose when people based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the concentrations in the human G@@ alle found at the highest recommended daily dose of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , not more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of apes , and are far below the border values ( 6 % ) of vit@@ ro sol@@ ub@@ ility . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits these effects were observed according to dos@@ ages , which led to exc@@ uses of the 3@@ - and 11@@ ples of the mid @-@ Ste@@ ady @-@ State Au@@ c at recommended clinical di@@ al@@ d@@ osis . &quot;

AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y injection solution is used to fast control of Agi@@ dity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schizophren@@ ia or in patients with the German episodes of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if an or@@ ale therapy is not attached .
&quot; as soon as it is clin@@ ically attached , the treatment should be finished with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole solution and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
to boost res@@ or@@ ption and minimize the vari@@ ability , an injection at the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep in the glut@@ eus @-@ Maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under re@@ traction of adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.2 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) can be given depending on the individual clinical status considering the drug or acute therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) .

there are no investigations on the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ iness of injection in patients with Agi@@ ousness and behavi@@ oral disorders which were otherwise caused by schizophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
&quot; if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is additionally considered necessary to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ iness solution as necessary , patients should be observed in terms of an extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure in case ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
studies on safety and effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ iness solution are available for patients with alcohol or pharmaceutical poison@@ ing ( caused by prescribed or illegal medicines ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be applied with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( el@@ yo@@ cardi@@ ac disease , hypo@@ vol@@ an@@ a@@ emia , treatment for hyp@@ ot@@ ony , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with hem@@ ac@@ ular drugs ) or hyper@@ ton@@ ie ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;

&quot; clinical manifestations of a m@@ n are high fever , muscle sti@@ ff@@ ness , changing consciousness and signs of autonomous instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ die , swe@@ ating and heart@@ beat disorders ) . &quot;
&quot; Poly@@ di@@ p@@ es , poly@@ ur@@ ry , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in terms of deterioration of the glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; a weight gain is generally observed in schizophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar Man@@ ia , due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ ous Man@@ ia , in which weight gain is known as side @-@ effect , and may lead to severe complications . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was greater compared to some of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in a study , in which healthy pro@@ ban@@ den Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg doses ) was applied as a mal@@ ination in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arity and at the same time Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular . &quot;
&quot; 105 The H@@ 2 @-@ Ant@@ ler Fam@@ oti@@ din , a stomach acid blo@@ cker , reduces the rem@@ nant rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is not relevant as clin@@ ically . &quot;

the following side effects occurred in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ iness solution more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side listed below is defined by the following criteria : frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
107 The following side effects are more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ a@@ pra@@ z@@ ole as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( see section 5.1 ) :
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study , over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients was under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was charged with patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment . &quot;
during the long @-@ term experience period over 26 weeks at a placebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients with placebo treated patients .
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , during which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratories , revealed no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; increases the CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of the patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole patients , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;

110 and behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ iness injection solution with statisti@@ cally significant improvements from Agi@@ ousness / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders associated with placebo and was similar to Hal@@ oper@@ dol .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 2@@ 91 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as Agi@@ ousness and behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole solution associated with a statisti@@ cally significant increase in symptoms regarding the Agi@@ ity and behavi@@ oral disorders associated with a statisti@@ cally significant reference to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - Re@@ ference @-@ reference . &quot;
the observed average improvement of the starting point on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score on the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; in analyses of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe deliber@@ ations , a similar effectiveness was observed in terms of overall population , but a statistical signature could be determined due to a decreased patient &apos;s number . &quot;
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1.@@ 2@@ 28 schizophren@@ ia ( oral ) compared to placebo a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms .

in clinical trials an increased moral risk and risk for serious cardiovascular events have been observed if er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents were observed by over 12 g / d@@ l ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have not shown any significant benefits that is primarily attribut@@ able to the gift of epo@@ chs when the ha@@ em@@ glo@@ bin@@ centr@@ ation is due to the control of the ill@@ iter@@ acy symptoms and the prevention of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions necessary .
the Hä@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ an increased by about 1 g / d@@ l ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / d@@ l ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of high blood pressure .

&quot; following current findings by treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with kidney failure , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ zed , the progression of kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency is not accelerated . &quot;
in tum@@ our patients the treatment of therapy of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be taken into account for the assessment of therapeutic efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ Gift and the Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response ( patients who need to be trans@@ fun@@ ct ) .

the decision for application re@@ combin@@ ant Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ads should be based on a benefit risk involving the patient &apos;s participation that should also take into account the specific clinical context .
&quot; in patients , intended for greater electri@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , if possible , before the beginning of the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia investig@@ ates and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients who undergo a greater electri@@ fied orthop@@ edic surgery , as they should have an increased risk of thro@@ har@@ b@@ inger and vas@@ cular disease , especially in an underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it may not be excluded that in treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa worth patients with an initial type of epo@@ e@@ tin worth of &gt; 13 g / d@@ l an increased risk of post@@ operative thro@@ m@@ bot@@ her@@ nia / vas@@ cular events can exist . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled studies , it has not been proven to improve overall survival or reduce the risk of tum@@ ours . &quot;

the most common side effect during the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dos@@ is@@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hyper@@ ton@@ ic .
an increased incidence thro@@ mbo@@ vas@@ cular events ( see Section 4.@@ 4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients under the treatment with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ines .

in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treated patients and the patient .
&quot; in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treated patients with an@@ a@@ emia due to various more common mal@@ ign@@ ancies , statisti@@ cally significantly higher mortality than with the controls . &quot;
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis and related complications in associated human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treated patients and by controls .
there is an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bol@@ dened events which will be treated with re@@ combin@@ ant Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and cannot be ruled out a negative effect on the overall survival .

A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is applied to treating the following diseases : • oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease which makes the bone br@@ ittle ) both in women after the men@@ opause and in men .
&quot; it is applied in patients with a high frac@@ tory risk ( bone mar@@ ches ) , including in patients who have suffered a low trau@@ ma of the kno@@ b ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get the touch of a disease , which changed the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should be given a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or inj@@ ecting into a muscle . &quot;
&quot; the administration of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can reduce the symptoms in the three days after in@@ fusion of in@@ fusion , like fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headaches . &quot;
&quot; to treat the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must be prescribed by physicians who have experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; since the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is like in Zom@@ eta , a part of the data material for Zom@@ eta was taken up by A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , almost 8 000 persons were involved in oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of vert@@ saw and hip frac@@ tures was investigated over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study formed 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , who had suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; it was investigated the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years . &quot;
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two studies in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared six months with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) .
main indic@@ ator for the effectiveness was whether the salary of the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( an enzyme building ) in the blood is norm@@ alized or at least 75 % compared to the starting point .
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of spine women was reduced by patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( without any other oste@@ opor@@ ose@@ ente ) over a period of three years compared to the patients under placebo by 70 % . &quot;
in comparison of all patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without any other oste@@ opor@@ otic medication ) with those under placebo the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study with men and women from A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a had 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 92 from 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side @-@ effects of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less common in repeti@@ tive in@@ fu@@ sions .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must not be applied in patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ ate or one of the other components .
&quot; as with all Bis@@ phosph@@ ates , patients at A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a are subject to patients at A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a to the risk of kidney , reactions to in@@ fusion and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( Ab@@ die of bone tissues ) in the ja@@ ws . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a provides guidance material for doctors who use A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a to treat A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as similar material for patients , in which the side effects of the medicine should be explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor . &quot;

&quot; to treat post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended once a year . &quot;
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture the administration of in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a will be recommended for two or more weeks after the operating supply of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a should be prescribed by physicians who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a a long R@@ emis@@ sion period was observed in patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , accordingly twice daily 500 mg elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently low @-@ trau@@ matic envelope of hip , the initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 , i.e. or@@ atory or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , can be reduced by using Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
patients with kidney disease ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) In patient with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended because limited clinical experience is available for these patients .
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary , as the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
&quot; children and young people A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended for use in children and young people under 18 years , because data are missing for in@@ conceivable and effectiveness . &quot;
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because for these patients population only limited clinical experience .
a pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ emia is before the start of therapy with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a through adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the rapid setting of the effects of Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone structure , a temporary , with symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ emia can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , accordingly twice daily 500 mg elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer disease , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , poor oral hygiene ) should be performed prior to an application of Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate a dental treatment with appropriate preventive dental treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients who require dental attacks , there are no data available to whether the interruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen in oral area . &quot;
clinical assessment by the treating doctor should be basis for the treatment plan of each patient and are based on an individual benefit assessment .
&quot; the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , can be reduced by using Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the incidence of patients reported as serious by @-@ effect cases was increased in patients , the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 % ) ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot;
&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis Studies ( P@@ FT , H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fr@@ ac@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was the overall prevalence of bi@@ kers between A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 2,@@ 6 % ) and placebo ( 2.2 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) unwanted drug impacts are listed in table 1 . &quot;
kidney functional disorder Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid was associated with kidney functional disorders that are considered to increase the kidney function ( i.e. an increase in the ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure .
the change in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance ( annually before administration ) and the incidence of kidney failure as well as a restricted kidney function were comparable to in a clinical study in oste@@ opor@@ osis between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in Ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of gift was observed at 1.8 % of patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients compared to 0.@@ 8 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of the laboratory studies , the temporary as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic calcium range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , at 2.3 % of patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , treated in a large clinical study , treated at 21 % of patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get @-@ studies treated patients . &quot;
all patients additionally received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study to post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis in the study to prevent clinical questionn@@ aires after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) .
&quot; in the study , for the prevention of clinical frac@@ tures , the vitamin D @-@ mirror were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received a initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis vitamin D before the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions after the administration of Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid in a large clinical trial was reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion place , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reports ( 0.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;

&quot; the early stages @-@ spheres ( α , and β , with the above @-@ mentioned ½ values ) probably represent the fast res@@ or@@ ption in the bones , and the ex@@ cre@@ tion of the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; in the first 24 h 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is tied in the urine , while the rest is tied mainly to bone tissues . &quot;
&quot; the overall body clearing is independent of the dose 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ influenced by gender , age , race or body weight . &quot;
&quot; an extension of the in@@ fusion period of 5 to 15 minutes led to the withdrawal of customs of customs - concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the area under the curve ( Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation against time ) . &quot;
a dimin@@ ished clearing of by cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ En@@ z@@ ym@@ ology of metabolic substances is unlikely because Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed and because it is a watch@@ ful or not a direct and / or irre@@ versi@@ bly , hydrogen @-@ dependent in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -

&quot; according to the CH@@ MP directive on risk management systems for human medicines , the R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; &quot; Peri@@ o@@ dic Safety Update Report &quot; &quot; ( PS@@ UR ) . &quot;
&quot; a revised R@@ MP should be filed • If new information may be known , which could affect the current statements of security , the pharmaceutical company plan or activity to minimize the risk of minim@@ ization . • inside 60 days when an important milestone ( to pharmac@@ o@@ y@@ ancy or risk minim@@ isation ) has been reached . • In request of the E@@ MEA . &quot;
&quot; Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a sub@@ stan@@ z@@ class , which is called bis@@ phosph@@ ate , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the touch . &quot;
&quot; decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially o@@ estrogen , which are formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass , which is observed in men . &quot;
&quot; at the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get takes place the bone structure too fast , and new bone material is un@@ arranged , which makes the bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a works by norm@@ alized the bone structure once more norm@@ alized with a normal bone formation and gives rise to the bones again strength .
&quot; if you are having dental treatment or have a dental surgery , please inform your doctor that you will be treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; when applying A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a with other medicines Please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you are taking other medicines / apply or have recently been taken / used even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor , it is particularly important to know whether you are taking medicines from which they are known to the kidneys . &quot;
when using A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a together with food and drink you worry that according to your doctor &apos;s instructions sufficient liquid before and after the treatment with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once per year , which is administered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion into a v@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have recently broken the hip , the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a will have two or more weeks after the operating supply of the sleeve . &quot;
mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg that will be administered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion into a v@@ ene .
&quot; since A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a works for a long time , you will eventually need another dose for a year or longer . &quot;
it &apos;s important to follow these instructions exactly to follow the calcium mirror in your blood in time after in@@ fusion is not too low .
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can work for longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
if the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was fit immediately with your doctor or hospital in order to arrange a new date .
before ending the treatment with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a Falls you are considering the end of treatment with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . please take your next doctor of doctor true and discuss this with your doctor .
side effects in connection with the first in@@ fusion often occur very frequently ( with more than 30 % of patients ) after the subsequent in@@ fu@@ sions are less frequent .
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headaches , occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; currently it is unclear whether A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a causes this irregular heart attack , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms when you get A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;

&quot; if the drug is not used directly , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions of application , usually 24 h at 2 ° C to 8 ° C are not exceeded . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ traumati@@ zing sleeve , the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended , the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a two or more weeks after the operating supply of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; before and after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , patients must be supplied sufficient with fluid ; this is particularly important in patients who receive a di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid setting of the effect of Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone structure , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ emia can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , respectively at least twice daily 500 mg elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ traumati@@ sed hip frac@@ ture , a initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. or@@ atory or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended in front of in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;

the summary of the E@@ PA@@ R for the Public The present document is a summary of the European Public Health Administration report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) in which explains how the Committee for Human@@ itarian Sciences ( CH@@ MP ) has been judged to make recommendations concerning the application of drug .
Ac@@ tos are used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It may be applied alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( in particular overweight patients ) . • It can be applied together with another di@@ abet@@ es@@ drug medicine ( Du@@ al@@ therapy ) .
&quot; in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) are used , which cannot be satisfactory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ ph@@ onic packaging or ins@@ ulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ ph@@ onic packaging or ins@@ ulin can be retained , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of the sul@@ ph@@ onic leu@@ ka@@ emia or ins@@ ulin is reduced . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s own ins@@ ulin can be improved better and the blood sugar mirror , which makes type @-@ 2 diabetes better set . &quot;
&quot; for more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of Ac@@ tivities in Tri@@ ple@@ otherapy has been examined ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ ph@@ onic acid , in addition , they received either an account or placebo for 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies the concentration of a substance was measured in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) , which indicates how good the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that the blood sugar has been reduced by doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ otherapy study , the effect of the additional gift of accounts for the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ac demonstrated in a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional gift of placebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and ins@@ ulin was studied in 2@@ 89 patients , the patients , the Ac@@ tos in addition to ins@@ ulin , compared with 0.@@ 14 % in the patient , which took additional placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side @-@ effects related to Ac@@ tos were visual disorders , infections of the upper respiratory tract , weight @-@ taking and hypo@@ cr@@ atic ( dimin@@ ished sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos must be applied neither in patients ( allergic ) to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , which might be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic K@@ eto@@ azi@@ de ( high ket@@ one mirror - ac@@ ur@@ esp@@ ace - in the blood ) . &quot;
&quot; it has been decided that ac@@ tos in the context of a mon@@ otherapy ( in a few use ) is intended to serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients , where met@@ form@@ in is not shown . &quot;
October 2000 the European Commission issued the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for authorisation from accounts in the entire European Union .
&quot; the tablets are white to white , round , curved and carry on one side the markings &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the wording &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also displayed for combination with ins@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar has been inadequate with ins@@ ulin or in@@ compatibility due to contra@@ indications or in@@ toler@@ ability ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
&quot; the application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age are not available , so the application is not recommended in this age group . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from the presence at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier her@@ edi@@ tary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose of dose . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a heart failure , weight gain or oil , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a heart failure , weight gain and oil , when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is applied in combination with ins@@ ulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular Out@@ come study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and existing advanced macro@@ vas@@ cular disease was performed .
&quot; in this study , an increase in reports on heart failure , however , did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
in patients with increased output liver liver scores ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard area ) or with other signs of a liver may not be used Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on .
&quot; when the AL@@ T mirror are increased until the 3 @-@ times the upper limit of the standard area , the liver scores are as soon as possible to control . &quot;
&quot; if a patient symptoms developed to indicate such a patient symptoms , such as un@@ resolved nausea , vom@@ iting , colon@@ isation , Ap@@ peti@@ t@@ lessness and / or darker Har@@ n , are the liver values to be checked . &quot;
the decision to continue whether the treatment of patients with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should continue to be led by the laboratory parameters of the clinical assessment .
&quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a dos@@ ages weight gain has been proven to stir up fat and in some cases associated with a fluid . &quot;
&quot; as a result of a her@@ modi@@ cally , under the therapy with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , under the therapy with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a slightly reduction in the middle hour of hem@@ ost@@ it@@ az@@ one ( relative reduction to 4 % ) and the hem@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction to 4.@@ 1 % ) . &quot;
similar changes have been observed in compar@@ atively controlled trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients suffering from 3 @-@ 4 % and ha@@ em@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 3 @-@ 4 % and ins@@ ulin ( relative reduction of the hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ s by 1 @-@ 3 % and the ha@@ mat@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased ins@@ ulin @-@ sensitivity , in patients , the pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as or@@ ale branch or as branch @-@ combination therapy with ins@@ ulin , is the risk of a dos@@ is@@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the market launch was reported under the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , on a occurrence or deterioration of a diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular cord with a reduction in visual acu@@ ity . &quot;
it is unclear whether there should be a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms if patients report more disorders of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable oph@@ thal@@ mic declaration should be considered .
&quot; in a summary analysis of messages from random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one &quot;
the repar@@ ation incidence amoun@@ ted to 1.9 questionn@@ aires per 100 patient @-@ years with the pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated women and 1.@@ 1 questionn@@ aires in women who were treated with a comparison medication .
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study conducted over 3.5 years for investigation of cardiovascular events , questionn@@ aires at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.2 % ; 0.5 % per 100 patient years ) who were treated with a comparison medication per 100 patient years ) who were treated with a comparison medication . &quot;
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient desires a pregnancy or this entry is the treatment ( see Section 4.6 ) .
&quot; studies on the investigation of the interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effects on the pharmaceutical drugs or pharmaceutical co@@ dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. or@@ ale contrac@@ ep@@ tive , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ kan@@ al@@ blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ former are not expected . &quot;
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) resulting in an increase in the Au@@ c of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one around the 3 @-@ times .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) performed in a reduction of the Au@@ c of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one decreased in pregnancy the hyper@@ ins@@ ulin and increased ins@@ ulin resistance of the parent and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the federal growth .
&quot; very frequently &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , individual cases : unknown ( not invaluable from the present data ) . &quot;
these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ g@@ or and the brake inde@@ xes of the lens as they are observed also in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic active ingredients .
&quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T An@@ sti@@ ce occurred frequently on such as under placebo , but more rarely than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; in an Out@@ come study in patients with existing advanced macro@@ vas@@ cular disease , it was the incidence of a severe heart failure under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one to 1,6 % higher than under placebo if pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one b@@ z@@ w . &quot;
&quot; since the launch of the market , it has rarely been reported about heart failure under the Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , however , when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was applied in combination with ins@@ ulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; there has been a summary analysis of reports from random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with the pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated groups and more than 7.@@ 400 patients treated with compar@@ ably treated groups . &quot;
&quot; in the study conducted over a period of 3.5 years of current pro@@ active study , questionn@@ aires at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) with patients treated with a comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days occurred no symptoms . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one seems to have an activation of specific core prescription drug ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) , which leads to an increased ins@@ ulin @-@ sensitive activity of liver , fat , and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces the glucose production in the liver and the peripher@@ al glucose rate in case of ins@@ ulin resistance increases .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de as mon@@ otherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the time until after the therapeutic effect of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after the treatment of therapy , a blood sugar ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one at 69 % of patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de ) could be maintained . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo@@ controlled study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar were dis@@ continued despite three im@@ on@@ ati@@ ger optimi@@ zing phase with ins@@ ulin , to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo random@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; in patients under the Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the middle H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % , compared to the patients which continued to only ins@@ ulin ; a reduction in ins@@ ulin treatment was observed in the group treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies over a year , a statisti@@ cally significant deri@@ vation of the Alb@@ ula in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ az@@ one was shown in comparison to the initial values . &quot;
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( Mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , on 18 weeks investigation into type 2 @-@ diabe@@ tics .
&quot; in most clinical trials compared to placebo a reduction of the total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids , and a rise in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as slightly , however clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL levels observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced in comparison to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de the total plastic wall gly@@ cem@@ ic and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol levels . &quot;
compared to placebo a statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol levels has been observed while under met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de dimin@@ ished values have been observed .
&quot; in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was reduced not only the so@@ ber tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d@@ mirror , this both via an effect on the tri@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic absorption as well as the hep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a cardiovascular Out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and existing advanced macro@@ vas@@ cular disease were random@@ ized in groups of up to 3.5 years , in addition to existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular therapy either pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo . &quot;
&quot; after or@@ ative application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is rapidly resor@@ ting to un@@ changeable Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one on plasma usually 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis the contribution of M @-@ IV is the effectiveness of the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II minim@@ ized is minim@@ ized . &quot;
&quot; in Inter@@ actions studies , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effect on the Phar@@ m@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical co@@ dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) or lo@@ wers the plas@@ ma@@ con@@ centric of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; after or@@ ative application of radio@@ active mark@@ i@@ ed Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the mark@@ er was mainly found in the subjects ( 55 % ) and a lower amount in the resin ( 45 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the mean Plasma Eli@@ min@@ ation period of un@@ changeable pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is within the people 5 @-@ 6 hours , and that of the entire active Met@@ abol@@ ites is 16 - 23 hours . &quot;

&quot; this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on the hyper@@ ins@@ ulin and increased ins@@ ulin resistance of the parent , thereby dimin@@ ished the availability of the metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the federal growth . &quot;

&quot; in a further study of two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in each have been studied with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials about 1 year , a statisti@@ cally significant deri@@ v@@ ation of the Alb@@ ula in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ az@@ one was shown in comparison to the initial values . &quot;

&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ ane was divided into a total of 2@@ 94 patients with type 1 diabetes where the pancre@@ as no ins@@ ulin can produce , and type 2 diabetes , in which the body is unable to utilize the ins@@ ulin . &quot;
&quot; in the study , after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which shows how good the blood sugar has been adjusted after 12 weeks . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ ane led to a withdrawal of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c sp@@ els , which pointed out that the blood sugar levels were similarly strong as with another human@@ ins@@ ulin . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ ane should not be applied in patients , which may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human@@ ins@@ ulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the cans of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ ane may need to be adapted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar ( the complete list is available to pack ) . &quot;
the Committee for Human@@ itarian Medicine ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ ans over@@ l@@ acked the risks of diabetes in the treatment of diabetes .
October 2002 shared the European Commission to Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S approval for the marketing of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ ane in the whole of the European Union .
mixed ins@@ ulin products are usually applied once or twice daily when a fast initi@@ als effect will be desired together with a long lasting effect .
the injection needle must be at least 6 seconds long under the skin to make sure the whole dose has been inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar can be improved significantly for example by an intense ins@@ ulin @-@ warning symptoms . the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia symptom has changed and should be advised accordingly .
&quot; any changes regarding strength , brand , ins@@ ulin , ins@@ ulin , ins@@ ulin , ins@@ ulin , ins@@ ulin or ins@@ ulin @-@ method ( through re@@ combin@@ ant DNS against ins@@ ulin origin ) can lead to a change in dosage . &quot;
&quot; if changing to Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ ane is required in patients with a dosage adjustment , it can be necessary at first dosage or during the first weeks or months after switching . &quot;
&quot; some patients , at which hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions came up after a change of animal ins@@ ulin in human ins@@ ulin , reported that the early warnings of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia had less pronounced or different than with their previous ins@@ ulin . &quot;
&quot; before travelling , going over several time zones , the patient should be pointed out to get the advice of his physician , as such trips can lead to other times , that ins@@ ulin and meals must be applied to other times . &quot;

&quot; Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who already have signs of cryst@@ all@@ ings , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or tox@@ ins ( &quot; &quot; stones &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; stones &quot; &quot; i.e. greater pri@@ mor@@ als that can lead to artic@@ ular and bone damages ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ inary tract is still over 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ ite , the dose can be increased at once a day of 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , still toxicity may still occur ; therefore , patients may take at least during the first six months under treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic even further medicines for preventing po@@ ison . &quot;
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ tation as it has not been studied for these groups .
&quot; in the first study , recorded by 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy three different Aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) compared with one of the placebo ( hypo@@ medi@@ kam@@ ents ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ uri@@ dic ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied in a dose of 300 mg each day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day . &quot;
&quot; main indic@@ ator for the effectiveness was the number of patients , their ur@@ inary bars in the blood for the last three measurements under 6 mg / d@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of the patients , the Aden@@ ur@@ ic took place in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients having a ur@@ inary level in the blood of under 6 mg / d@@ l . &quot;
in comparison this was about 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and with none of the 134 patients under placebo .
&quot; the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headaches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( Nau@@ sea ) , rash and abnormal liver values . &quot;
&quot; in particular , in patients with the heart of heart , there may be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; at the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ inary epitheli@@ um in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but it could also be a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; treatment of chronic hyper@@ uri@@ tic disease in diseases , which have already led to ur@@ an@@ tics ( including one of the history of the history known or currently present tox@@ ins , and / or a Gi@@ cht@@ arthritis ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ser@@ um acid level after 2 @-@ 4 weeks still amounts to &gt; 6 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , a dosage increases on AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney disease , the effectiveness and safety so far have not been fully investigated ( creative Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
children and young people since children and young people have no experience in children and young people who are not recommended using F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this patient group .
&quot; in case of organ@@ ically transplan@@ ts , it is not recommended for organ@@ ically transplan@@ ts , the application of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ ate in this capacity is not recommended ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
cardiovascular disease In patients with isch@@ a@@ ary heart disease or de@@ compensated heart failure the treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ ate is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as with other har@@ n@@ se@@ atic medicines , it may come during treatment start to an acute attack because due to the reduction of the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ sä@@ ur@@ es@@ pi@@ eg@@ els initially may be mobili@@ zed in the tissue . &quot;

&quot; it is therefore recommended , before the beginning of the F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ treatment and in the further course depending on the clinical use of a liver test ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ on was done no exchange studies on F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ ate but it is known that the X@@ O @-@ Hem@@ p can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line level ( an in@@ hibition of the met@@ ation of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease where the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after men@@ opause in which there is a risk for a low vitamin D mirror .
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ - and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; to avoid a irritation of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient may take up to after the first food intake of the day , the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet should not lie down . &quot;
&quot; since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately in pharmaceuticals , which are approved in the European Union , presented the data from earlier studies and published literature . &quot;
&quot; the company also conducted a study with 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis , in order to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE regarding the increase in the vitamin D mirror . &quot;
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D @-@ mirror had been treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 11 % ) than those with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also presented data to indicate that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on dose corresponds exactly the dose , which is needed for preventing bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side @-@ effects ( observed for 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headaches , pain of movement apparatus ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive apparatus ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , sor@@ cer@@ ation , dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gie ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( diar@@ rhe@@
&quot; in patients with limited hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , Vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other components , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be applied . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied in case of the food waste , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( ger@@ in@@ consistent calcium levels ) or in patients who are not at least 30 minutes long standing or sit . &quot;
January 2007 the European Commission issued the company Mer@@ ck Sharp &amp; D@@ oh@@ me Ltd . approval for the marketing of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the entire European Union .
&quot; capsule @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a button on one side and &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; on the other side . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , beverage or inhal@@ ation of drugs ( including An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ - and Vitam@@ in@@ supple@@ mentation ) for the day .
&quot; the following indications are to be observed precisely to reduce the risk for ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation , and associated side effects ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) : &quot;
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed up by the day with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not leave the tablet as a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a . • The patients should not take place before the first food intake of the day that shall be at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
&quot; B. pe@@ p@@ tic Ul@@ kus , active gast@@ ro@@ intestinal alpha bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal in@@ al@@ tra@@ kt , except P@@ yl@@ or@@ la@@ sty , only under special caution should be given ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; Ö@@ sop@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as oil @-@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a and ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ oms , rarely followed by ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al rop@@ es , were reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partly were these severe and required a hospital reference ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore look attentive to all signs and symptoms to point out the adverse reactions such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gie , pain while dro@@ pping or retro@@ ern@@ ern@@ ale pain , or new or imp@@ lim@@ ati@@ al so@@ d@@ burn , to apply the medicine and get medical advice ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of severe ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side @-@ effects seems to be increased in patients who are not properly taking correctly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms , which refer to a ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation . &quot;
it is very important that all Do@@ ing instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
&quot; while in large @-@ scale clinical trials with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate no higher risk was found , rarely ( after market launch ) stomach and du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ zer@@ a , including some severe and with complications , reports ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the j@@ aw , usually related to a tooth extraction and / or of a local infection ( including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapy has been predominantly intraven@@ ously intraven@@ ous Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; there are no data available to provide the clu@@ es , whether the subscri@@ ber of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ therapy in patients who require a ortho@@ surgical procedure , reduces the risk of a oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the j@@ aw . &quot;
clinical evaluation by the treating doctor is crucial for the therapy planning on each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
patients should be instruc@@ ted to take notice of the intake of a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE the tablet for the next morning after they have noticed their om@@ is@@ tion .
&quot; you should not take two tablets on the same day , but take the intake of one tablet per week , as originally planned on the scheduled week@@ day . &quot;
&quot; other diseases , which affect the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) , should also be treated at the beginning of therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE . &quot;
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate food and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplement , an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da and some or@@ ale medicines may affect the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if taken at the same time . &quot;
therefore patients must wait at least 30 minutes after the intake of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate at least 30 minutes before they take other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; although specific Inter@@ actions studies were not performed , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines , without clin@@ ically relevant exchange effects . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and therefore it is not valid during pregnancy .
&quot; animal studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on leave no indication of direct harmful effects in terms of pregnancy , the embryo / fet@@ al or post @-@ nat@@ al development . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the j@@ aw was reported in patients under Bis@@ phosph@@ ate , but most reports were reported by cancer patients , but was also reported in Oste@@ ology patients . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the Ser@@ um @-@ Cal@@ ci@@ um took up to &lt; 8.@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 2,@@ 0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the Ser@@ um@@ - Ph@@ osph@@ ate to &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency . &quot;

Ad@@ vaginal is given adult patients who was given a kidney or liver transplan@@ ts to prevent a de@@ ple@@ tion of the transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
&quot; as Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has submitted the results from previously done studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft and data from the published literature . &quot;

&quot; main inde@@ er of the effectiveness was the number of patients in which the transp@@ l@@ ant was rep@@ ain@@ ted after a treatment duration of one year ( for example , how often renewed organ@@ transp@@ l@@ ant or a resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , recent studies of 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients were conducted with liver transp@@ l@@ ant and studied patients with liver transplan@@ tation , as compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft from the body . &quot;

&quot; only doctors , who are familiar with the immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy and the treatment of transp@@ l@@ ant patients , this drug ad@@ ress or changes in the immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of systemic exposure to tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us this can lead to transp@@ l@@ ant tat@@ too or to increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ isation . &quot;
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; re@@ alizations of the formulation or the regime should only be made under the eng@@ or@@ ally control of an experienced physician in the transp@@ l@@ ant medical physician ( see sections 4.@@ 4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; in a sequence of conversion to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug surveillance and corresponding dosage adjustment must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains intact . &quot;
&quot; the Dos@@ age of Ad@@ vaginal , should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of de@@ ple@@ tion and toler@@ ability in individual cases and to blood @-@ level regulations ( see &quot; &quot; Recommen@@ dations &quot; &quot; below &quot;
&quot; after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vaginal , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us talent should be controlled prior to conversion and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; on Day 4 the system of systemic , measured as a talent mirror , with both formulations comparable to both kidney and le@@ ber@@ ated patients . &quot;
me@@ tic@@ ulous and repeti@@ tive controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transp@@ l@@ ant under Ad@@ vaginal in order to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate after@@ math phase .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , an adjustment of the Ad@@ vaginal Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as can take several days before the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the condition of the patient allowed in the first post@@ operative phase , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment intraven@@ ous ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrations for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) are introduced with a dose of ca . &quot;
duration of the application Z@@ ur repression of transp@@ l@@ eness must be maintained ; consequently the maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ tation &apos;s pro@@ phyla@@ xis Pro@@ phyla@@ xis Pro@@ phyla@@ xis The or@@ ale Ad@@ vaginal therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a day daily gift in the morning .
further dosage adap@@ tions can be later required since the Phar@@ m@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of the stabili@@ zation of the patient after the transp@@ l@@ ant .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation Pro@@ phyla@@ xis of the Tran@@ ale Ad@@ vaginal therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a day daily gift in the morning .
&quot; dosage recommendations - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ raf must be revers@@ ed by twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules at once daily intake of Ad@@ vaginal capsules , so this conversion in proportion is 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the whole daily dose . &quot;
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After a conversion from other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants to Ad@@ vag@@ ant once daily must begin treatment with each in kidney and liver transp@@ l@@ ant initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis for the pro@@ phyla@@ xis of the transp@@ l@@ ant tat@@ too .
&quot; the heart transp@@ l@@ ant in adult patients , which are converted to Ad@@ vaginal , is an or@@ ale initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day every day . &quot;
&quot; other transplan@@ t@@ ants received not clinical experience in a or@@ alen initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of 0.@@ 10 - 0,@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in case of pan@@ elled initi@@ als in a or@@ alen initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of 0.@@ 3 mg / kg / day , in a oral initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of 0.@@ 3 mg / kg / day for application . &quot;
dosage adap@@ tations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function Z@@ ur maintenance in the targeted area can be necessary in patients with severe liver disorders that may be necessary in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions .
&quot; patients with reduced kidney function , As the kidney function is not an effect on the Pharmac@@ ology of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not required . &quot;
&quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ ality of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of the ser@@ um of ser@@ um is recommended ( including a regular determination of ser@@ um Cre@@ ativity ) , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ lays and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) . &quot;
conversion of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in at Ad@@ vaginal At the conversion from a Cic@@ los@@ por@@ e to the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is advisable ( see sections 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) .
&quot; recommendations to the valley level in full blood The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of de@@ ple@@ tion and toler@@ ability in the individual case , under the aid of full blu@@ ff@@ t @-@ tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ level controls . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley level during the first two weeks after transp@@ l@@ ant , followed by perio@@ dic controls during the maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; blood @-@ Tal@@ levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vaginal , dosage adjustment , changes of immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy or in simultaneous application of substances , which could change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us thorough@@ ton@@ ation ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Ad@@ vaginal is a medicine with a low Clear@@ ance , adjustments of the dose may need several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered . &quot;
&quot; according to clinical studies , the information in clinical studies make sure that a successful treatment in most cases is possible if the valley levels in the blood 20 n@@ g / ml not exceed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical practice , the valley levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in full blood usually lie in the full time after liver transplan@@ t@@ ations in the period of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and with snow and hearty transplan@@ ts patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; during the rec@@ ol@@ ding therapy of liver , kidney , and cardi@@ ac transplan@@ ts were generally used blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious unwanted events , including transp@@ l@@ ant tat@@ too or other side effects , which can occur in the sequence of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us under@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; re@@ alizations of the formulation or the regime should only be made under the eng@@ or@@ ally control of an experienced physician in the transp@@ l@@ ant medical physician ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; 5 Z@@ ur treatment of adult patients with transp@@ l@@ ant treatment , which proved to be proven compared to other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants as therap@@ ists , are still no clinical data for the retar@@ ded formulation Ad@@ vaginal . &quot;
&quot; to pro@@ phyla@@ xis of the transp@@ l@@ ant tat@@ too , for adult heart transplan@@ ts and transp@@ l@@ ant tat@@ too , there are still no clinical data for the retar@@ ded formulation of Ad@@ vaginal . &quot;
&quot; due to possible interactions , which can lead to a lowering of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ bo levels in the blood and a de@@ ton@@ ation of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the cur@@ ran@@ nel ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) is to avoid or prevent other plant healing during a treatment with Ad@@ vaginal ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea a particularly me@@ tic@@ ulous monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us concentrations in the blood , since the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels can be subjected to significant fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , there was a chamber of Lyme cardi@@ om@@ yo@@ path@@ ia recorded as a cardi@@ om@@ yo@@ path@@ ia and observed hyper@@ tro@@ phy , which can therefore occur under Ad@@ vaginal . &quot;
&quot; further factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart suffer , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , hypertension or liver disorders , infections , liquid over@@ load and oil . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants , the effect of sunlight or ultra@@ violet light should be restricted by appropriate clothing or use of a solar protection by means of a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients are taking the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us symptoms , symptoms for Pr@@ es such as headaches , changed state of consciousness , cro@@ ws and visual disorders , a radi@@ ological investigation should be a radi@@ ological investigation ( e.g. . &quot;
&quot; da Ad@@ vaginal cem@@ ented , retar@@ ded , l@@ act@@ ose , is presented in patients with the rare her@@ edi@@ tary Gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ intolerance , l@@ act@@ ase deficiency or gluten @-@ Gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ absorption special caution . &quot;
the simultaneous application of medicines or herbal remedies known as Hem@@ mer or induc@@ tors from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can increase the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and therefore reduce the blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or reduce the blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
&quot; therefore , it is recommended to change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood levels at the same time of current substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A metabolism , and adjust the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain equ@@ itable concentrations accordingly ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;

&quot; Phar@@ m@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies report that the increase in blood levels mainly from the increased bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , due to the in@@ hibition of the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal combustion , results . &quot;
&quot; high dose pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as it is used in acute reactions , the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can increase or reduce the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood . &quot;
effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore the simultaneous application of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 metabolic .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ tiv@@ a can put down the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid @-@ contrac@@ tiv@@ a and thus can increase the hormone exposure , is especially careful in decisions regarding recep@@ tive measures . &quot;
the results of animals have shown that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us potentially reduce the Clear@@ ance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and extend their half @-@ time .
the results of a small number of investigations on transp@@ l@@ ant patients do not provide any indication that under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us compared to other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ors the higher risk for unwanted events with regard to the course and result of pregnancy .
&quot; in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the newborn is recommended to possible harmful effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially regarding its impact on the kidneys ) . &quot;

&quot; Adv@@ ate is used for treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with hem@@ hi@@ lie A ( one through the lack of factor VIII @-@ conditioned , inn@@ ate blood disorder ) . &quot;
dosage and frequency of application are based on whether advoc@@ ating to the treatment of bleeding or the prevention of bleeding for surgical procedures is applied .
patients with hem@@ hi@@ lie A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency that causes blood@@ stream issues such as bleeding in joints , muscles or inner organs .
&quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but according to a method that is known as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; : &quot;
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was brought in to the formation of the human being factor VIII .
&quot; Adv@@ ate is another approved in the European Union , similarly , it is similar , but the drug does not contain proteins or animal origin , so that the medicine contains no proteins or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ hi@@ lie A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the medicine was examined using the prevention of blood cells as well as surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study the effectiveness of Adv@@ ate was awarded in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood @-@ sep@@ tum in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood @-@ sep@@ tum with &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; good &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , py@@ re@@ xie ( fever ) , and the formation of antibodies to factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ate must not be applied in patients , which may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against the human being factor VIII , mouse or ham@@ ster @-@ protein or any of the other components . &quot;
March 2004 shared the European Commission of Ba@@ x@@ ter AG appro@@ ving the acceptance of a advent of Adv@@ ate in the entire European Union .
&quot; dosage The dosage and duration of substitution therapy is based on the severity of the factor VIII @-@ defect , after the place and the extent of the blood and the clinical condition of the patient . &quot;
&quot; in the following case of mor@@ r@@ ha@@ gical events , the factor VIII activity in the relevant period does not fall under the stated plastic bars ( in % of the norm or in i.e. / d@@ l ) . &quot;
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until pain and acute impairment are eliminated .
injection all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the danger to the patient is above .
&quot; during the treatment process , controlling the dose of the too far and the frequency of injections is recommended to the control of the factor VIII @-@ plastic bars . &quot;
individual patients may differ in their response to factor VIII to reach various in vi@@ vo recovery and have different semi @-@ value times .
3 Pro@@ phyla@@ xis Z@@ ur &apos;s long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis in patients with severe hem@@ hi@@ lie A should be given between 20 and 40 as a factor VIII per kg body weight by 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor is not to be achieved or if the bleeding is not ruled by a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out in order to indicate an in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or@@ values , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so other therapeutic interventions must be er@@ ased . &quot;
&quot; the en@@ rich@@ ment speed should be directed after the patient , with maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutral antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ hi@@ lie A .
these In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII aligned Ig@@ G immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ine which will be quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say .
&quot; the risk of having to develop inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ relate with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 extern@@ alization days is the biggest and of genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ positions days and an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ sch @-@ known inhibit@@ or development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the re @-@ occur ( lower ) inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of the here@@ hi@@ lie A in women , there are no experience whatsoever about the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; the A@@ DR@@ s were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , all previously untreated patients who have higher risk to the formation of inhibit@@ ors , headaches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , commonly ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , rarely ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of the patients was calculated by the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) calculated . b ) The unexpected waste of the blood pressure factor VIII @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els occurred in post@@ operative ( 10 - 14 post@@ operative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE In@@ fusion .
the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the time and both the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirror in the plasma as well as the Clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient values on 15 post@@ operative day .

&quot; in previously , patients of a current clinical trial formed 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ ATE patients inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; the immune response of the patient to traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by the investigation of antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed a statisti@@ cally significant up@@ surge as well as an ongoing peak of antibodies against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell disease , otherwise , however , no sign or symptoms associated to an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; in four patients , over the appearance of Ur@@ tik@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophil@@ es gran@@ u@@ rolog@@ y@@ tes were reported in several repeated product texts as part of the study . &quot;

&quot; based on the data available since the initial data has been reviewed by the CH@@ MP , the CH@@ MP has been valued as positive , but considering that the security profile has to be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP on the basis of the safety pro@@ fil@@ s of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a filing of PS@@ UR@@ s all 6 months , decided that the approval in 5 years should apply for a further development process . &quot;
December 2008 shared Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited to the Committee for Human@@ itarian Medicine ( CH@@ MP ) officially that the company has res@@ igned its application for approval for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
&quot; usually , however , the chest , the brain , the bones or the past@@ ure parts ( tissues that connect the other structures in the body , surrounds and leans ) of it . &quot;
&quot; this is a sort of virus that has been changed genetically , that it may carry a gene into the body &apos;s cells . &quot;
&quot; with the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ an , it is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; that has changed so that there is no copies of itself and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ex@@ in could have been pr@@ un@@ ed directly into the tum@@ ors , thus enabling cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein . &quot;
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is made of not def@@ ective in the human body made available p@@ 53 @-@ gene , carries usually to restore damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA can not be recovered . &quot;
&quot; at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i Cancer , in which the p@@ 53 @-@ gene is broken , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company presented data from a study with a patient , at the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i Cancer in the field of sub @-@ construction , entered into bone and brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP had tested the answers of the company on the questions , were still some questions un@@ answered . &quot;
&quot; based on the examination of the initial submitted documents , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions that will be sent to the company . &quot;
according to the CH@@ MP was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ ine in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i Tum@@ ore will bring benefits to patients .
&quot; the committee also had concerns about the processing of drug through in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
&quot; the company did not notice the CH@@ MP not in knowledge of whether the return consequences for patients , which currently has clinical trials or &quot; Com@@ modi@@ fying Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in . &quot;
changing active medicine means that the tablets are so composite that one of the effective components immediately and the other slowly is released over a few hours .
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is applied to the treatment of the symptoms of seasonal allergic Rh@@ initi@@ s ( ha@@ y fever , through an allergy to pol@@ len ) , with patients with nas@@ al sli@@ ces ( pet@@ ri@@ fter nose ) . &quot;
for adults and young adults over 12 years the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a tablet that should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food .
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and will be termin@@ ated as soon as the symptoms , above all the swelling of the nose @-@ grin@@ der ( hidden nose ) , are sealed . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be traced to the sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
&quot; the main @-@ effective symptoms were the changes in the severity of the hypo@@ cris@@ y symptoms , which were reported by the patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment . &quot;
&quot; during the study , the patients bore their symptoms all 12 hours into a diary with a standard sc@@ ala , as difficult symptoms have been in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; when considering all gras@@ ps of the nose reported the patients , the aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , about a decrease of symptoms by 4@@ 6.@@ 0 % , compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in the patient who took pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the nas@@ al sli@@ ces was seen , the patients under the aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a allevi@@ ation of symptoms by 26.@@ 7 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who took the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( watch for 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ st ( throat infection ) , mouth @-@ drying , ti@@ bility , in@@ som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sle@@ e@@ iness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ enz ( sle@@ e@@ iness ) , in@@ som@@ atic disorders , and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze can be used in patients who are potentially hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , pseudo @-@ substance or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) , are not applied . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze must also be used in patients with hypertension ( t@@ worth@@ less water ) , cardi@@ ac or vas@@ cular disease ( hypertension of the thy@@ roid ) or have already had a hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke ( hypertension the thy@@ roid ) or have a risk for a hem@@ or@@ ha@@ gic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission adopted the company SP Europe for the marketing of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in the whole of the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is to swal@@ low in the whole ( i.e. without them to cr@@ ush or che@@ wing ) . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied to children under 12 years due to mis@@ conception and effectiveness ( see Section 5.1 ) in children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the use time of 10 days since during long @-@ term application the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine can take time with time .
&quot; after the decrease in the swelling of the mu@@ gs in the upper respiratory , the treatment can be continued when required with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ as as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; as Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine contains , the medicinal product is also contra@@ indicated in patients who are treated with mon@@ o@@ am@@ in@@ oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors or within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is applied to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ entary activity with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ tin , cab@@ ur@@ id , cab@@ ur@@ id , gra@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ edr@@ ine , ox@@ y@@ met@@ ac@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) . &quot;
safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy have not been checked for this patient collective and the data does not extend to pronoun@@ ce appropriate recommendations for dosage .
the safety and efficacy of the aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver disorder and the data does not extend to pronoun@@ ce appropriate recommendations for dosage .
&quot; patients must be informed about the treatment in the occurrence of a hyper@@ ton@@ ic or a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ or , heart rhyth@@ m@@ ical symptoms , nausea or any other neurological symptoms ( such as headaches or rein@@ forcement of headaches ) must be dropped . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of the following patients , patients under D@@ IG@@ ITA@@ L@@ IS • patients with hyper@@ ton@@ ic disorders • patients with hyper@@ ton@@ ic disorders in an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder construction or bron@@ chi@@ pas@@ mus in An@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before implementing the mat@@ ological tests , since Anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka can prevent otherwise positive reactions to indicators , prevent or reduce their extent in their extent . &quot;
&quot; in the context of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , where Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were added in addition , however , no clin@@ ically relevant exchange effects or changes of the Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in has been observed . &quot;
&quot; at the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or tests , no significant differences could be determined between the patients with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and those treated with placebo treated patients regardless of whether des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in alone or with alcohol was taken . &quot;
&quot; this is not yet identified for Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible enzymes , so that interactions with other medicines could not be completely excluded . &quot;
&quot; Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in hem@@ med in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the drugs C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 did not inhi@@ bit and neither a sub@@ strate nor an In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ kop@@ red is one . &quot;
the in@@ conceivable of the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not guaranteed to have experiences of a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies however no increase in frequency of abnorm@@ alities compared to the frequency when compared to the normal population .
&quot; since reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to the human being , and on the basis of vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ c properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be found that it may come in very rare cases to a ben@@ ding , which can lead to an impairment of traffic noise , or the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; the symptoms can vary between a Z@@ NS depression ( Se@@ dation , Ap@@ no@@ e , dimin@@ ished mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , lift , con@@ vul@@ sions ) and a Z@@ NS stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tering processes . &quot;
&quot; headaches , anxiety , sensu@@ ality , heart rhyth@@ mia , thirst , distur@@ ban@@ ces , coron@@ ary pain , di@@ shar@@ pen@@ al , di@@ sil@@ ently , t@@ wilight , ten@@ acity , visual disorders , and hyp@@ ot@@ ony or hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; a Z@@ NS stimulation is especially probable in children as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ dry , p@@ up@@ ill@@ en@@ rigid and - di@@ lat@@ ation , Hau@@ ling , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , and gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; this close both the im@@ itation of the release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines like IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mac@@ ular cells , IL @-@ 6 , and IL @-@ 13 from human mac@@ ular cells , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 out of human mac@@ ular cells . &quot;
&quot; at a single dose trial with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg does not affect standard measurement sizes including the strengthening subjective blows or the tasks associated with the flies . &quot;
&quot; controlled clinical trials were found at the recommended dosage of 5 mg every day , no increased frequency of sle@@ ep@@ iness compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; the or@@ ale application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in recommended dosage can give further sympathetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ st or manifestations of a Z@@ NS arousal . &quot;
&quot; there were 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , where 4@@ 14 patients Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets were received . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the total @-@ level for symptom atics ( except nas@@ al @-@ s@@ skin @-@ swelling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of the aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the dimin@@ ishing effect , determined by the nose @-@ sli@@ mming effect , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
the efficacy of the aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of sex , age or ethnic affili@@ ation . &quot;
in the context of a single @-@ dose study of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in within 30 minutes of administration in the plasma .
&quot; according to the per@@ oral application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with healthy promot@@ ers over 14 days , the fly @-@ weight of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was reached in day 10 . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ type study , which was carried out with the formulation as tablet to healthy adult Pro@@ ban@@ den , was found that four Pro@@ ban@@ den Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in poorly uni@@ form@@ ities . &quot;
&quot; a component Inter@@ actions study reveals that the exposure ( C@@ max and Au@@ c ) from pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , according to the all@@ u@@ bi@@ edr@@ als of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in bio@@ fuels , was in exposure to the gift of an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on the safety of security , toxicity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and Re@@ productive Tox@@ ic@@ ity , allow to recognize the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , however , not to recognize any particular dangers for the human being . &quot;
&quot; the combination of no greater toxicity than their individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine . &quot;
the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ als was a combination of up to 150 mg / kg / day and a rab@@ bit in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day not ter@@ ato@@ genic .

&quot; for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once daily , in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; for children aged six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies with some 4 800 adults and young people with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies of patients who were also as@@ thma ) .
&quot; the effectiveness was measured by changing the symptoms of symptoms ( ju@@ ck@@ iness , number and size of qu@@ add@@ les , impairment of sleep , and efficiency on the day ) before and after six weekly treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies were presented , in order to prove that the body will take the sy@@ rup , the solution and melting in the same way as the tablets and the application in children are harmless . &quot;
&quot; in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies have been taken into account , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us became an average withdrawal of the symptom ( symptom score ) to 25 to 32 % , compared to the acceptance of 12 to 26 % in patients who received placebo . &quot;
&quot; in both studies at Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the cancellation of the symptom was after six @-@ week treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % in the patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us must not be applied in patients , which may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; January 2001 , the European Commission adopted the company SP Europe for approval by A@@ eri@@ us across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to allevi@@ ate the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see below 5.1 ) . &quot;
there are limited experience from clinical studies for the effectiveness in the application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in for young people from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous disease changes and may be resum@@ ed after the crash of symptoms and may be resum@@ ed by the symptoms .
&quot; in the persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms , 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) , patients can be recommended during the most aller@@ gen time . &quot;
&quot; clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in the context of clinical studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in tablets , in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were added in addition ( see below 5.1 ) . &quot;
in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study was in@@ conclu@@ sive of A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol the powerful effect of alcohol ( see below 5.1 ) .
&quot; however , patients should be figured out that in very rare cases it may come to ben@@ ding , which can lead to an impairment of traffic noise , or the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials at different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tik@@ aria , were reported in the recommended dose of 5 mg every day 3 % more side @-@ effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects on which is reported more common than in placebo were fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , mouth @-@ drying ( 0.@@ 8 % ) and headaches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; at a clinical study with 5@@ 78 you@@ thful patients from 12 to 17 years old , the com@@ mon@@ est side effect headaches had been treated at 5.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and at 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dosage study , in which up to 45 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( ninete@@ en clinical dose ) were administered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines like IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mac@@ ular cells , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mac@@ ular cells . P @-@ sel@@ ek@@ tin to End@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ al@@ cells . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study with multiple entries , in des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dosage of up to 20 mg was administered daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the ninth of the clinical dose ) was administered for ten days , is not an extension of the Q@@ T@@ c Inter@@ v@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; at a single dos@@ ages trial with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg does not affect standard measurement sizes including the strengthening subjective blows or the tasks associated with the flies . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving the symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and redness of the nose , ju@@ ck@@ ling river and redness of the eyes as well as j@@ ot@@ rei@@ z on the palate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rhet@@ oric can also be classified depending on the duration of symptoms alternatively in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and pers@@ istence allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent Rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent Rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as shown by the total level of cargo for the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ economics , A@@ eri@@ us effectively was reduced by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s caused by seasonal Rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tik@@ aria is investig@@ ating for more forms of the Ur@@ tik@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ ology in the different forms is similar and chronic patients may be able to recru@@ it more quickly . &quot;
&quot; since the hist@@ am@@ in@@ fre@@ is@@ cation is a caus@@ al factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ular disorders , it is expected that Des@@ lor@@ ry is also confirmed in other forms of the Ur@@ tik@@ aria in other forms of the Ur@@ tik@@ aria as well ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tik@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving p@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of qu@@ add@@ les at the end of the first tin . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti @-@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka , in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tik@@ aria , the minority of patients , which did not respond to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka , from the study . &quot;
an improvement of the itch by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in treated patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of the sleeping and of the wax significantly as it was measured by a 4 @-@ point scale on evaluating these variables .
&quot; in a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ ine@@ tics study , in which the patients Dem@@ ographi@@ cs were comparable with the general seasonal Rh@@ initi@@ s @-@ population , was achieved at 4 % of patients a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in . &quot;
there are no clue to a clin@@ ically relevant grief after even daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days before .
&quot; however , this is not yet identified for Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible enzymes , however , so that interactions with other medicines have not been excluded completely . &quot;

&quot; clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in the context of clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were added in addition ( see below 5.1 ) . &quot;
in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study was in@@ conclu@@ sive of A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol the powerful effect of alcohol ( see below 5.1 ) .
the overall prevalence of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group as well as with the placebo group .
&quot; in clinical trials with adults and young adults in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tik@@ aria , were reported in the recommended dose 3 % more side @-@ effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and young people , where up to 45 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( ninete@@ en clinical dose ) were administered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
children aged between 1 and 11 years old who were asked for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy in question received a daily disaster of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
&quot; because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tik@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in adults can be en@@ rolled for children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study with multiple adults and young people , the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dosage of up to 20 mg was applied over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and young people , in des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the ninth of the clinical dose ) was applied for ten days at adults , there was no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c Inter@@ v@@ alls . &quot;

&quot; June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. of the Committee for Human@@ itarian Medicine ( CH@@ MP ) officially launched its application for approval of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to the prevention of avi@@ aries H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 @-@ In@@ flu@@ enza by adults and older people . &quot;
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be applied to protection against influenza ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the In@@ flu@@ enza @-@ A virus .
&quot; this is a special kind of vaccine that could cause a tribe of the flu , which could cause a future pan@@ demic . &quot;
&quot; a flu @-@ pan@@ demic breaks off when a new tribe of the flu is turned out , which can easily spread from man to man , because people still have no immunity ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; according to administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognises the parts contained in the vaccine being contained in the vaccine as &quot; &quot; physical &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; by doing so , the immune system is later able to form in contact with a flu virus of this gene@@ alo@@ gical antibodies . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the membrane ke@@ gel of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which recognizes the human body as the body of body ) , agreed and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot;
a survey of some of the study buildings showed that the study was not conducted according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; by doing so , the scope of clinical data base for the evaluation of the security of the vaccine is not enough to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA &apos;s guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ demic vaccines . &quot;
&quot; should you take part in a clinical examination and need more information about your treatment , please contact your doctor &apos;s doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti @-@ viral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with human immune system virus from type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which is the acquired immun@@ ficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who may not swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the security of this combination has not been studied . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase should then be sub@@ ordin@@ ated only if the doctor has tested what anti @-@ viral medicines has taken before and the likelihood is that the virus will appeal to the drug .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily which are taken along with twice a day 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti @-@ viral medicines .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase is based on the body weight .
A@@ gener@@ ase decreases in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines the HIV amount in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
&quot; AIDS is not able to cure AIDS , however , the damage of the immune system and hence the development of AIDS related infections and diseases are hesit@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti @-@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adult who had previously not been treated with Prot@@ eas@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; this was compared with low do@@ si@@ fied k@@ on@@ avi@@ r , A@@ gener@@ ase was compared with 20@@ 6 adults , who had been used earlier protein inhibit@@ ors , with other prot@@ eas@@ ants . &quot;
main indic@@ ator for the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable concentrations of HIV in the blood ( virus last ) or the change in the viral load after the treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had previously taken no protein earlier , after 48 weeks more patients had a viral load below 400 copies / ml than under placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ gener@@ ase has also reduced the viral load , though of the children who had previously been treated with Prot@@ eas@@ ants , very few of the treatment mentioned earlier . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults , who had previously been treated with prot@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the Vir@@ al last after 16 @-@ weekly treatment as effective as other prot@@ eas@@ ants : &quot;
&quot; in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ eas@@ ants , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase to become a stronger waste of the Vir@@ al last after four weeks than in patients who took their previous prototype earlier : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headaches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , Flat@@ ul@@ enz ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) , vom@@ iting , rash and FA@@ IR ( fatigue ) . &quot;
&quot; 2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase must not be applied in patients , which may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase must also not be used in patients , the cur@@ b weed ( a herbal supplement for treating depression ) or medicines that are exactly like A@@ gener@@ ase and are harmful to high concentrations in the blood of health . &quot;
&quot; as with other drugs against HIV , the risk of a Li@@ pod@@ stream@@ ph@@ ie ( change in the distribution of the body fat ) , the risk of a Li@@ pod@@ stream@@ ph@@ ie ( changes in the distribution of the body fat ) , a oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( symptoms of an infection caused by the immune system ) . &quot;
&quot; in conclusion , the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase for use in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines used in combination with other anti @-@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of protein previously untreated HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adult and children over four years towards the risks . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken along with the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic ver@@ tically Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee determined that the benefit of A@@ gener@@ ase is in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have not been detected before . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , &quot; as at the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information is available . &quot;
October 2000 shared the European Commission to the company G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited for the marketing of A@@ gener@@ ase throughout the European Union .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines used to treat HIV @-@ 1@@ - infected , prot@@ ru@@ den@@ mer ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children older than 4 years . &quot;
for usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules for pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sts of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r are administered together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r should take account of the individual viral mut@@ sters and the treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r as a solution is reduced by 14 % less than a capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of Am@@ kled avi@@ r twice daily with 100 mg k@@ k@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; 2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fied addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ kled avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of Am@@ kled avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , effectiveness and safety of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ eas@@ ants were not examined in children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the failure of data to in@@ conceivable and effectiveness ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose should be reduced to A@@ gener@@ ase capsules at 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver disorders that can be reduced to 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
the simultaneous application should be treated with caution with mild or moderate liver disorder in patients with severe liver disorder it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase must not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width , and also sub@@ str@@ ates of cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
herbal supplements which contain cur@@ is@@ wort ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) may not be applied due to risk reduced plastic ma@@ con@@ centric and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r during the intake of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure in HIV infection and that they also continue to develop opportun@@ ist infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including the treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be applied with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) .
&quot; patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , have an increased risk of severe liver impacts with potentially fatal course . &quot;
&quot; for the case of a simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the information of this medicine . &quot;
patients with existing reduced liver function including a chronic @-@ active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver dys@@ functions under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
&quot; the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and other glu@@ co@@ o@@ ids changes , which is not recommended via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended , unless the potential benefit of a treatment the risk of systemic cor@@ tis@@ ation , including Mor@@ bus Cus@@ hing and Sup@@ pression of the adren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
since the metabolism of H@@ M@@ G Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors and me@@ vast@@ atin is highly recommended by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is a simultaneous administration with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin because of the increased risk of m@@ yo@@ path@@ ia including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sen not recommended .
&quot; 4 For some medicines , which can cause severe or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ o@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International norm@@ alisation rati@@ o ) , methods for determining the drug con@@ centr@@ ation are available . &quot;
&quot; in patients who take these medicines at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plastic fuel bars ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Am@@ pera avi@@ r can be the effectiveness of hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills , however the information is not sufficient to estimate the nature of the interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given simultaneously with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ at@@ at@@ ent@@ ment symptom symptom , especially when there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of a toxicity because of the high prop@@ ylene gly@@ col solution , this form of form is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution for certain other patients . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set to duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; in patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including prot@@ eas@@ ants , was reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or an ex@@ tradition of an existing type of diabetes . &quot;
many of the patients had other ail@@ ments to their therapy medications that are associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and with drug dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders associated with it . &quot;
&quot; with h@@ ates @-@ ophil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) , the reports were treated with prot@@ ectors , are reports of an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ ters , including spontaneous cut@@ ters , and ha@@ il@@ thro@@ ws . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , an inflammatory reaction to as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ ist infections can develop the severe clinical states or deterioration of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a multi@@ fac@@ torial op@@ ti@@ ology is accepted ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ isation , higher body @-@ measure index ) , cases were reported by oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose especially in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase must not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width , and also sub@@ str@@ ates of cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
&quot; C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase , with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be combined with medicines , whose active ingredients are chie@@ fly above C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with he@@ avier and / or life @-@ threatening side effects . &quot;
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in the Au@@ c of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r that can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to a res@@ ome development .
&quot; in trying to equi@@ p the reduced plastic bars by a dosage increase of other Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often have been observed unwanted effects on the liver . &quot;
St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) ) The Ser@@ um@@ mirror of Am@@ Spec@@ avi@@ r ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) can be humili@@ ated by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) .
&quot; when a patient is already taking St. John &apos;s weed , the am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r@@ mirror are possible and , if possible , to check the viral load and put it in the cur@@ rant . &quot;
a dosage adjustment for one of the medicine is not required when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered along with am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz below ) .
50@@ 8 % increases for C@@ max at about 30 % if k@@ p@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ pping avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administered .
&quot; in clinical trials , doses were used twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which occupy the effectiveness and un@@ thin@@ kable of this treatment schem@@ at@@ as . &quot;
52 % humili@@ ates if Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg k@@ avi@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was administered .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ kled avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg k@@ k@@ avi@@ r twice daily is administered .
&quot; a d@@ osing recommended for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ etra can not be given , but there is a constant surveillance recommended , since the effectiveness and in@@ conceivable of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; there was no pharmac@@ o@@ cular study performed to apply A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , but is recommended because of the imagin@@ ative component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , however , that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
this is why with the Gift of E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and k@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dosage adjustment required .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended because the exposure of both prot@@ ru@@ g@@ um would become low .
the effect of ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ ine to other prot@@ ru@@ d@@ mer and available limited data can suggest that ne@@ vir@@ g@@ ade may lo@@ wers the ser@@ um con@@ centr@@ ation of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advisable because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din may be less effective because of the decreased or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plastic bars could be less effective . &quot;
&quot; if these drugs are applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical surveillance should be made , as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous Gift of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation ( Au@@ c ) by Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % and thus to an increase in part with Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin side effects .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is necessary along with A@@ gener@@ ase , will become a reduction in the dosage of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dose , although there is no clinical data . &quot;
&quot; Phar@@ m@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , but could be increased the plastic bars of both medicines in the case of simultaneous administration . &quot;
simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ in@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ ac@@ ol in the plasma with 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily led to an increase of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in the plasma with 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol at once daily without the simultaneous application of Fos@@ am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , if they are applied together with A@@ gener@@ ase , possibly leading effects . &quot;
patients should therefore be applied to toxic reactions which are associated with these drugs if they are used in combination with a@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ eas@@ ants , it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da will not be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , since it can come to Res@@ or@@ atory disorders . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ sions known as enzymes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degra@@ dation of the plasma level of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; the Ser@@ um concentrations of Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ kan@@ al@@ block , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , di@@ odi@@ pin , in@@ sti@@ pin , le@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin
&quot; simultaneous in@@ ges@@ tion with A@@ gener@@ ase , whose Plas@@ ma@@ con@@ centric may increase considerably and strengthen with PD@@ E@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in connection of the side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disorders and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in the k@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days to pro@@ ban@@ den were increased , while the endo@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plastic ( 4 times daily ) were increased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ con@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ inter@@ interval from 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended along with these glu@@ co@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , unless the potential benefit of a treatment is the risk of systemic cor@@ tis@@ ation of effect ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; at H@@ M@@ G @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin , whose hydrogen increases are highly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are to be expected to expect the un@@ timely administration of A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
since plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ ps increased this H@@ M@@ G Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors to m@@ yo@@ path@@ ia including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ se , the combined application of these drugs with am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
&quot; it is recommended to be a frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations up to the stabili@@ zation of the mirror , since the Plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased with equal treatment of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied together with oral en@@ gen@@ ase Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while on the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution . &quot;
data for simultaneous application of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ru@@ d@@ ol@@ ors point to a possible increase in the plastic bars of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around the 3@@ - to 4 @-@ fold .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered along with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ at@@ at@@ ent@@ ment symptom symptom , especially when there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; because of the low reliability of historical Ver@@ same , there is no recommendation at present to adjust how the am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose is to be adjusted when Am@@ kled avi@@ r is administered at the same time using meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous Gift from War@@ far@@ in or other or@@ alen anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ um , along with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alisation rati@@ o ) is recommended for the possibility of a shut@@ down or strengthening of the anti @-@ thro@@ m@@ ous effect ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills , therefore , are also recommended as alternative methods of contrac@@ eption . &quot;
a careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants ( for example des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended in the current gift of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be applied after careful use of potential usability for the mother compared to the potential risks for fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the milk l@@ actic rats , am@@ bit@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether Am@@ kled avi@@ r is over@@ flowing with people into the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;

the further development of descendants including Fer@@ til@@ ity and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r to the womb .
the in@@ conceivable of A@@ gener@@ ase was investigated with adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment of side effects were slightly up to moder@@ ated , early on and led rarely to the treatment of treatment . &quot;
&quot; with many of these events , it is not clear whether they are used in connection with taking A@@ gener@@ ase or another at the same time for HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the atro@@ city . &quot;
&quot; most of the listed side effects come from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) where with prot@@ eas@@ ants , patients had received 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily . &quot;

&quot; each of these four with a decreased sensitivity to Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain crus@@ hing resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r but generally preserved . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data on crus@@ hing resistance between Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ eas@@ ants , for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ spec@@ avi@@ ade , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ s@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 insulation ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r reserves its activity against some other prot@@ eas@@ ants @-@ resistant insul@@ ates ; the preservation of these activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in isolation . &quot;
the early interruption of a se@@ cular therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in limits that may affect the following treatment .
&quot; the evidence of the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 600 mg twice daily ) is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized study , in which with PI pre @-@ treated adults ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nu@@ cl@@ osi@@ dan@@ alo@@ ga ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , so@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ do@@ si@@ fied k@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; geb@@ oo@@ st@@ ert &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; three @-@ three @-@ thre@@ es ( n = 16@@ 3 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the study by PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
&quot; the primary analysis presented the non @-@ under@@ embarrass@@ ment of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the virus after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ under@@ score of 0.@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml . &quot;
&quot; the proof of the effectiveness of un@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ed A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 2@@ 88 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 with PI was treated . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase solution was to take and capsules three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
there was no low do@@ si@@ fied k@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of those with PI presented patients had previously made at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients were included in the study a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase of the CD@@ 4 cell number from 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the output value . &quot;
19 Basi@@ cs on this data should be considered in therapy optimization with PI pre @-@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ed &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; after or@@ ative administration , the medium duration ( t@@ max ) is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0,5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
50@@ 8 % increased for C@@ max at about 30 % if k@@ p@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with am@@ il avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
&quot; the administration of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % reduction of the au@@ c , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ kled avi@@ r 12 hours to dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in the ste@@ ady state ( C@@ min , ss ) has remained un@@ influenced by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake influenced the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume is about 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and leaves to include a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ checked penetration of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the substance in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ bund@@ ling am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ geb@@ em am@@ bit@@ r@@ r remains constant , fluctu@@ ates percentage of free active components in the Ste@@ ady State depending on the area of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min . &quot;
&quot; therefore , drugs have to indu@@ ce or indu@@ ce the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or a sub@@ strate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 if they are given simultaneously with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily Am@@ bit@@ r@@ r @-@ exposure such as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is from the solution 14 % less bi@@ over@@ feet than from the capsules ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram base .
&quot; also the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neglected , hence the impact of a kidney disease is likely to be low in the elimination of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these treatment schem@@ ata lead to am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r plasma comparable to those that are generated in healthy pro@@ gangs after a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ del@@ avi@@ r twice daily without the simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies of can@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity to mice and rats occurred in male animals , the 2,@@ 0 @-@ times ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to the people , after twice daily qualifying of 1200 mg of Am@@ kled avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of the hep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ ome and car@@ cin@@ ome was not yet solved and the relevance of this observed effects for man is unclear .
&quot; from the present ex@@ posi@@ tional data on the human being , both from clinical trials and therapeutic application , however , there were little evidence of the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ics , micro@@ k@@ ern@@ test to rats and chromos@@ ome ab@@ err@@ ation of human peri@@ ph@@ ers Ly@@ mp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , was Am@@ kled avi@@ r neither mut@@ an@@ ox@@ ic or gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; these liver toxic can be monitored and proven in clinical everyday life by measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; so far , clinical studies have not been observed in clinical trials at patients , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase nor after the end of the treatment . &quot;
studies for juven@@ ile juven@@ iles who were treated from an age of 4 were revealed both in the control and with am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r animals of a high mor@@ t@@ ality .
&quot; with a systemic plasma exposure , the significant under ( rab@@ bits ) or not significant higher ( rats ) than expected exposure to therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including t@@ y@@ mus@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and low @-@ sized skel@@ etal changes have been observed , which pointed to an delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules without the ampli@@ fied addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ kled avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of Am@@ kled avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application should be treated with caution in patients with s@@ watch@@ ful or easier liver disorder in patients with severe liver disorder it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; 26 For some medicines , which can cause severe or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ o@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International norm@@ alisation rati@@ o ) , methods for determining the drug con@@ centr@@ ation are available . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set up on duration 27 when a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; an increased risk for a Li@@ pod@@ stream@@ ph@@ ie has been associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in the Au@@ c of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r that can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to a res@@ ome development .
50@@ 8 % increases for C@@ max at about 30 % if k@@ p@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ pping avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administered .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ kled avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg k@@ k@@ avi@@ r twice daily is administered .
&quot; a d@@ osing recommended for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ etra can not be given , but there is a constant surveillance recommended , since the effectiveness and in@@ conceivable of this combination is not known . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended because the exposure of both prot@@ ru@@ g@@ um would become low .
&quot; if these drugs are applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical surveillance should be made , as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is necessary along with A@@ gener@@ ase , will become a reduction in the dosage of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there is no clinical data . &quot;
&quot; the Ser@@ um concentrations of calcium @-@ block@@ ers like Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , dil@@ ti@@ pin , in@@ sti@@ pin , le@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ pin , N@@ ant@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ odi@@ avi@@ r , causing possibly the activity and toxicity of this medicine increases . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in the k@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days to pro@@ ban@@ den were increased , while the endo@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plastic ( 4 times daily ) were increased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ con@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ inter@@ interval from 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous Gift from War@@ far@@ in or other or@@ alen anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ um , along with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alisation rati@@ o ) is recommended for the possibility of a shut@@ down or strengthening of the anti @-@ thro@@ m@@ ous effect ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.@@ 0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl@@ est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.@@ 0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dr@@ on ) led to a decrease in the Au@@ c and C@@ min from Am@@ kled avi@@ r by 22 % b@@ z@@ w .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be applied after careful use of potential usability for the mother compared to the potential risks to the fet@@ us . &quot;

the in@@ conceivable of A@@ gener@@ ase was investigated with adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in case of over@@ dose the patient is to be observed in signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , necessary support measures are required . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB has been studied in both ac@@ utely and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ las@@ tic cell lines ( M@@ T @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripher@@ al bleeding . &quot;
&quot; the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ con@@ centric ( IC@@ 50 ) is located in the range from 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm for ac@@ utely infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µm for chronic , infected cells ( 1 µm = 0,@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) . &quot;

&quot; the applic@@ ations@@ and the duration of the treatment with Al@@ dara depend on the treatment of Al@@ dara for a maximum of 16 weeks . • In case of small bas@@ al cell disease , the cream is weekly during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles , with four weeks break between treatment cycles , three times weekly . &quot;
&quot; the cream is in front of sleep sli@@ pper@@ y to the affected skin surfaces , so that they remain enough for a long time ( about eight hours ) on the skin before they washed off . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dara was compared with a placebo ( the same cream , but without the substance ) . Al@@ dara was tested in four main studies on 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area each 16 weeks . &quot;
&quot; main indic@@ ator for the effectiveness was the number of patients treated with small bas@@ al cell disease in two studies , where patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dara or placebo either daily or five times a week . &quot;
main indic@@ ator for the effectiveness was the number of patients with complete down@@ grade of tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dara also tested in two studies on a total of 50@@ 5 patients with acute ceramics .
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dara was more effective than placebo . • At the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area amoun@@ ted to all four main studies 15 % to 52 % in all four main studies , but only 3 % to 18 % involving patients treated with Al@@ dara treated patients compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dara ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the use of the cream ( pain or ju@@ ck@@ iness ) .
&quot; clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ cor@@ ous , not hyper@@ trop@@ ic ceramics ( AK@@ s ) in the face or the scal@@ p at immun@@ competent adults , if the size or number of lesi@@ ons limit the effectiveness and / or acceptance of a cr@@ y@@ otherapy , and other topical treatment options contra@@ indicated or less suitable . &quot;
&quot; Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) before going to bed and leave 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot;
the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is so long to continue until all visible fats have disappeared in the genital or peripher@@ al region or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
a break in the above treatment should be done when intensive local inflammation appear ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) or if used in the treatment area an infection is observed .
&quot; if during the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the treated lesi@@ ons are only incomplete , another therapy should be started ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; when a dose was left out , the patient recorded the cream when he / she noticed this and then continue with the usual therapy plan . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream is in a thin layer , and in the framed , in@@ stituted infected skin @-@ area , until the cream is completely drawn . &quot;
&quot; in these patients , there should be a breakdown of treatment between the treatment of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with the possible worsen@@ ing of their autoimmune disease . &quot;
&quot; in these patients , there should be a breakdown of treatment between the treatment of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host@@ al reaction . &quot;
&quot; in other studies , in which no daily pre @-@ auth@@ auth@@ y@@ hygiene was performed , two cases of severe p@@ hi@@ mos@@ is were observed , and a case with one to the circumc@@ ision stri@@ fe has been observed . &quot;
&quot; with an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses , an increased risk for severe local skin irritation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , there were also severe local skin irritation , which made a treatment required and / or to have a temporary physical impairment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the outcome of the ureth@@ ra , some women had trouble passing urine , which required an emergency ca@@ the@@ ter@@ ization and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; for the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream directly following a treatment with other cut@@ ters used in the genital war@@ ring means , so far there are no clinical experience prior to the treatment of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od . &quot;
&quot; limited data indicate at an increased rate of low @-@ positive patients in HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown in this capacity to eliminate the removal of fats . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of the basic cell disease in I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm to the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips , or the hair@@ line was not examined . &quot;
local bon@@ ding actions are often but the intensity of these reactions takes back in general during therapy or reactions form after completion of the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
&quot; if it is necessary because of the discomfort of the patient or due to the severity of local bon@@ ding actions , a treatment break can be made by several days . &quot;
the clinical result of therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; since there is no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after treatment should be considered at ultra @-@ free bas@@ al cell disease , other suitable therapy forms . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs do not have a clinical experience , therefore the application is not recommended in previously untreated tum@@ ours . &quot;
data from an open clinical trial indicate that at large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) a lower probability of reference to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for treatment of acute ceramics , inside the nose or the ears or on the lip area within the Li@@ p . &quot;
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ceramics to anatom@@ ical bodies outside the face and the scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on acute ker@@ at@@ mos@@ is to under@@ poor and hands does not support the effectiveness in this application for the purposes , therefore such an application is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; local bon@@ ding actions often occur , but these reactions usually take back in the course of therapy to intensity or go back after lowering the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if local bon@@ ding actions can cause great discomfort or very strong , the treatment may be exposed for several days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical trial , patients with more than 8 AK@@ - lesi@@ ons pose a lower complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; due to the immun@@ otherapeu@@ tic properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients who receive immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive treatment ( see 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; from animal studies no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , the embryo / federal development , the repar@@ ations or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;

inform your doctor / your doctor or pharmac@@ ist / your pharmac@@ ist immediately when you do not feel at ease during the use of Al@@ dara cream .
&quot; if your skin responds to the treatment with Al@@ dara cream , you should not continue to use the cream , the affected skin area with water and a mild soap wash and your doctor or a pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
a humili@@ ated number of blood cells may make you more suscep@@ tible to infections ; it can cause that in your faster a blue spot comes or she can cause resistance .
inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects you have considerably affected or you notice side effects which are not stated in this usage information .
&quot; in addition , you can have Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z ( 32 % of patients ) , burning ( 26 % of patients ) or pain in the areas that you have raised Al@@ dara cream ( 8 % of the patients ) . &quot;
usually it is about lighter skin reactions which are within approximately 2 weeks after receipt of the treatment again .
&quot; occasionally , some patients notice changes at the applic@@ ations@@ location ( wound secre@@ tion , inflammation , swelling , der@@ mati@@ tis , der@@ mati@@ tis ) or irrit@@ ability , nausea , dry mouth , flu @-@ similar symptoms and fatigue . &quot;
&quot; occasionally , some patients suffer from the applic@@ ability , inflammation , whi@@ ps , s@@ add@@ ling , s@@ add@@ ling , swelling , but@@ ton@@ ous , swelling , but@@ ton@@ ation , heat @-@ gra@@ ding , but@@ ton@@ ous , breast @-@ gra@@ ding , fever , limbs , fever , weakness or ch@@ ills . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used in patients with a secure diagnosis of a mu@@ kop@@ ol@@ y@@ sac@@ chari@@ de ( M@@ PS I ; α @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( the symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves in connection ) .
&quot; this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ es , g@@ ags ) will not be disman@@ tled , and thus in most organs in the body and these are ashamed . &quot;
&quot; the following non neurological symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , sti@@ ff joints , the movements difficult , decreased lung volume , cardi@@ ac and o@@ gener@@ diseases . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor , the experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases . &quot;
&quot; the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out in a hospital or clinic with reproduction , and patients need to prevent corresponding medicines before administration , to prevent an allergic reaction . &quot;

&quot; in the study the safety of drug was mainly examined , however , it was also measured by its effectiveness ( in relation to reducing the G@@ AG concentrations in urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; for children under five years of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine around 60 % , and half of the treated children at the end of the study showed a normal large liver at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me at patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headaches , nausea , stomach pains , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion place . &quot;
&quot; very common side @-@ effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , decreased oxygen intake ( a measuring size of the lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ st ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may respond to patients who might be strongly over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reaction ) .
&quot; the European Drugs Agency ( E@@ MEA ) is all new information that may be known , check and update this summary . &quot;
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients who receive Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me as a result of reactions to in@@ fusion and development of antibodies .
June 2003 the European Commission of Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. adopted approval by Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me across the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology under the use of CH@@ O @-@ mam@@ mal @-@ cellular cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , Ei@@ erst@@ ock of the Chinese Ham@@ sters ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indi@@ gent therapy in patients with secure diagnosis of a mu@@ kop@@ ol@@ y@@ sac@@ chari@@ de ( M@@ PS I , α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase @-@ shortage ) inde@@ xed to treat the non @-@ neurological manifestations of the condition ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done by a doctor , the experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic disorders . &quot;
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can when the patient carries this out every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients cannot be recommended for a Do@@ zation scheme .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suffici@@ ency was not established , and for these patients cannot be recommended for a do@@ fication scheme . &quot;
&quot; with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , patients can develop in@@ fusion @-@ conditioned reactions that are defined as each in connection effect , which occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , these patients should continue to be monitored quickly and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be made available in an appropriate clinical environment , in the re@@ tention of medical emergen@@ cies for medical emergen@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected to form nearly all patients of Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the start of treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as little experience regarding the resum@@ ption of treatment after a longer break , has to be cautious carefully due to the theoretically increased risk reaction after a interruption of the treatment . &quot;
treat 60 minutes before the beginning of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti @-@ py@@ re@@ tica ) to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
&quot; in case of a slight or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction should the treatment with Anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen er@@ ges and / or a reduction in in@@ fusion rate , in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in case of a single , difficult in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be stopped in@@ fusion until the symptoms are brought to , a treatment with Anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be treated . &quot;
in@@ fusion can be added with a reduction in in@@ fusion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate where the reaction occurred has been resum@@ ed .
3 will be 3 ( Anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ) as well as reduction of in@@ fusion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate where the pre@@ formed reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because a potential risk of interference with in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular intake of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase exists .
&quot; animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , the embryo / fet@@ al development , birth and post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there is no data on new@@ bor@@ ns , which were served towards Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over the mother &apos;s milk , is recommended , while the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is not to be silent . &quot;
the side effects in clinical trials were mainly prescribed by 53 % of patients in phase 3 study ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years of age ( treatment duration of up to 1 year ) .
&quot; unwanted drug transactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me observed in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me aged 5 years or older at a total treatment duration of up to 4 years , often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre @-@ history , there occurred serious reactions , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory and facial Treat@@ ment ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children un@@ solic@@ ited drug impacts relating to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a ph@@ as@@ - 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with overwhel@@ m@@ ingly heavy @-@ form and treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; during the treatment of patients during the age of three months , it occurred within 3 months after the treatment of a ser@@ o@@ con@@ versions , with the patients aged under the age of 5 ( average after 26 days with patients aged 5 and older ) . &quot;
&quot; up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature retirement from the study ) at 13 / 45 patients were not reported by radio@@ immun@@ op@@ rene zip@@ itation ( R@@ IP ) As@@ say , including 3 patients , where it has never been to ser@@ f . &quot;
patients with missing reduction of the G@@ AG @-@ Spi@@ der in Har@@ n to as@@ certain while in patients with high antibodies a variable decrease of G@@ AG in Har@@ n was as@@ certain@@ ed .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a margin@@ ally to low neutr@@ alised effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vit@@ ro which did not interfere with clinical efficacy and / or reducing G@@ AG in Har@@ n .
&quot; the presence of antibodies did not seem to stand in connection with the incidence of unwanted drug transactions , even if the occurrence of unwanted drug transactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot;
the reason for the enzyme therapy lies in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accum@@ ulated sub@@ strate and the prevention of further accumulation sufficient restoration of the enzymes .
&quot; according to intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the cycle and absorbed by cells into ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely about Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 phosph@@ ates recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ized , double blind , plac@@ ebo@@ controlled phase @-@ 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study that had been recru@@ ited to the entire disease , the majority of patients were from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient pointed to the heavy phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients have been recru@@ ited if they had a for@@ ci@@ ated exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the FE@@ V and the absolute walking distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were recru@@ ited for an open @-@ record survey where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me every week .
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , which treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients compared to the placebo group , an improvement of the lung function and the secret capacity that is shown in the following table . &quot;
&quot; during the open extension study , an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , and of 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as seen from the following table . &quot;
the acceptance of the expected percentage FE@@ V is not significant over this period clin@@ ically not significant and the absolute pulmon@@ ary volum@@ ina increased further propor@@ tionally to the height of growing children .
from 26 patients with a hep@@ at@@ tainable before treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) to the end of the study a normal liver size .
&quot; within the first 4 weeks , a significant waste of the G@@ AG mirror in the Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) has been fixed , which remained constant up to the degree of study . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the hetero@@ geneous disease within the patient , the clinical significant changes caused by using a combined end@@ point test , was generally a improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change at 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted primarily by Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with the heavy course form and 4 of the middle @-@ course form ) .
&quot; in four patients the dosage was increased due to increased GA@@ G@@ - mirror in Har@@ n , 22 weeks in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg . &quot;
&quot; in several patients , a total of growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight increase ( n = 3 ) has been determined after the Z @-@ score for these age group . the younger patients with the difficult course @-@ form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the middle @-@ level form of cancer ( &lt; 2.5 years ) , and all 4 patients with severe form @-@ form , were limited to the older patients with severe damage , or no progress in cognitive development . &quot;
&quot; in a phase @-@ 4 study , examinations have been carried out on the G@@ AG mirror in the Har@@ n , the liver volume , and the 6 @-@ minute chassis . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the Do@@ zation scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative in patients , the difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two Do@@ ration@@ schem@@ ata is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medi@@ c@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information which will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated . &quot;
the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients under the age of five was similar to those with older and less severely affected patients .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety , toxicity , toxicity of repeated gift and reproduction , the pre@@ clinical data cannot recognize any particular dangers to the human being . &quot;
&quot; since no sealing studies were performed , this medicine may not be mixed with other medicines except with the 6.@@ 6th listed . &quot;

&quot; this tab will be treated as long @-@ term safety and efficacy formations to patients , which were treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , as well as data for the natural pro@@ filing of the disease in patients without this treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , a enzyme named α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a enzyme called α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which is missing certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ es ) , either in small amount , or this enzyme is completely absent . &quot;
if you are allergic to one of the ingredients of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if you have a severe allergic reaction to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase has occurred .
an in@@ fusion conditional reaction is any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fu@@ sion@@ day ( see section 4 &quot; Which side effects are possible &quot; ) .

&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is applied together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) when cancer is not removed , or spreads slightly to other parts of the body . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer , which is not the turn@@ oc@@ ated epitheli@@ um cells . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not been treated before , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ otherap@@ ies as a few therapy . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and injections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta administered together with Cis@@ pl@@ atin , should be given in front of or after the gift of Cis@@ pl@@ atin in addition an &quot; anti@@ em@@ e@@ tic &quot; ( drug against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a fluid lack ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood painting changed or during which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be reduced , or the dose should be reduced . &quot;
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed slo@@ ws down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells share .
&quot; the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed into its active form is easier than in cancer cells than in healthy cells , resulting in higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active duration of cancer cells . &quot;
A@@ lim@@ ta has been examined for the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ oms A@@ lim@@ ta in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy against their illness .
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ single lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were treated in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , which had previously been treated with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medicine against cancer ) . &quot;
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another medicine against cancer ) and both in combination with Cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study at 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
&quot; patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ pl@@ atin , on average 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the sole administration of Cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients who had previously received an chemotherapy was the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8,@@ 3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months at Doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; however in both studies patients , in which cancer is not the plate of SC@@ F cells , in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer survival times than with the comparative medicine . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission of El@@ i Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. passed a licence for In@@ lim@@ ta in the whole of the European Union . &quot;
every breakthrough @-@ bottle has to be applied with 4.2 ml 0.@@ 9 % of sodium chlor@@ ori@@ d injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) - resulting from a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary do@@ - is taken from a bottle of bottles and with 0.@@ 9 % of sodium chl@@ oride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) on 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is displayed in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line therapy of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bronze cancers except with excessive pl@@ atten@@ al epitheli@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is displayed for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bronze cancer unless with excessive pl@@ atten@@ al epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body base ( KO@@ F ) administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of Cis@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² CO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ - In@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ single bronze statue , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions must be given day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ ed @-@ gift , as well as the day after treatment a cor@@ ti@@ ko@@ ster@@ oid . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days prior to the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , at least 5 cans fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued during the entire therapy period , as well as for other 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ - dose . &quot;
patients also need an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week prior to the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dose as well as after each third install@@ ment cycle .
&quot; in patients , the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed received , should be created before each gift a complete blood image created - the , including a differentiation of the leu@@ co@@ cy@@ tes and a Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ zy@@ ten@@ stad@@ l . &quot;
the alkal@@ ine Ph@@ osph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ at trans@@ am@@ in@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ in trans@@ am@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be &lt; 3 @-@ times of the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle a dosage examination must take place under Ber@@ ück@@ tion - the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood image or the maximum not @-@ ugly therapy cycles .
&quot; according to recovery , patients must be treated according to the information in the tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for AL@@ IM@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Market C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 blood@@ stream .
should patients not be inter@@ sper@@ mat@@ ological toxicity ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) must be interrupted ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) that the patient must be interrupted by AL@@ IM@@ TA until the patient has the value of treatment before treatment
the treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be interrupted if in patients after 2 dos@@ is@@ th@@ o- or not @-@ ugly toxicity or not @-@ ugly toxicity or so@@ - continued during the appearance of degree 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies have no indication that in patients aged 65 Yahweh - or compared to patients under the age of 65 an increased risk risk - ko .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age because of non @-@ sufficient data for in@@ conceivable and effectiveness .
&quot; in clinical trials , patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance were necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min no dosage adap@@ tions needed to go beyond the dosage for all patients recommended dosage adjustment . &quot;
the data base in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance from less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the use is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver functional from &gt; to the 1,5 @-@ times of the upper limit value ( with abra@@ sion of liver metastatic phases ) or &gt; 5.@@ 0 @-@ times of the upper limit value ( with the presence of liver abnorm@@ alities ) are not specifically examined in the studies . &quot;
patients must be monitored with regard to the button market and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be administered in patients before their absolute neutr@@ ons figure again a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ mbo@@ genic amounts again has reached a value of ≥ 100 000 cells / mm ³ .
a dosage reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of the absolute Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ bes number , thes@@ es number and maximum non @-@ ugly - the ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a smaller toxicity and a reduction of degree 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ rop@@ ie and infection with degree 3 / 4 ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was be@@ amed when a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
&quot; therefore , all patients must depend on P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treated patients , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as pro@@ phy@@ - l@@ actic measure for reduction of @-@ related toxicity ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to medium in@@ suffici@@ ency ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) the simultaneous intake of non @-@ stero@@ idal anti @-@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and min@@ des@@ - TE@@ NS 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; all patients , for which treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed has to be used for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients with which these events occurred , corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including el@@ ong@@ ation , existing hypertension or diabetes . &quot;
therefore in patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid - accumulation in the trans@@ cellular room will be a drain of the result before the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment .
&quot; 5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ ous events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ color , and zer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events have been reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally , if this substance is commonly administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application of cat@@ chy living ( except yellow fever , this vaccination is contra@@ indicated ) not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the possibility of a mis@@ sive skull , the reproductive capacity consists of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be pointed out prior to treatment - g@@ um to obtain advice regarding sperm count . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance 7,@@ 1600 mg / day ) and Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1.3 g per day ) ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1.3 g per day ) to a decreased P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ ed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the result of a multip@@ licity of side effects . &quot;
&quot; therefore , caution is advisable when in patients suffering from normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or Ac@@ e- t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ine acid in high dosage . &quot;
&quot; i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and min@@ des@@ - TE@@ NS 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there is no data regarding interaction potential than with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ time like Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or Ro@@ fec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed . &quot;
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual variation of the smell status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cia and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alisation rati@@ o ) when the decision was made to treat the patient - ducks with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ um .
&quot; there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in pregnant , but as with an@@ de@@ - ren anal @-@ tim@@ ites are expected at an application in pregnancy heavy birth defects . &quot;
&quot; P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be applied during pregnancy , except if necessary , and after careful abra@@ sion of usability for the mother and risk of risk to the fo@@ etus ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the possibility of a irreversible skull of the reproductive capacity consists of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be pointed out before the treatment begins to take advice on the sperm count . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into the mother &apos;s milk , and unwanted effects in glu@@ ed inf@@ ant can not be ruled out . &quot;
&quot; the following table shows the frequency and severity of unwanted effects which were reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with Mes@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ om , as well as in 16@@ 3 patients with Mes@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ om , which received random@@ ised Cis@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;

alli is inde@@ b@@ ted to the weight reduction of adults with overweight ( body @-@ measure index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be applied in conjunction with an easily hypo@@ cal@@ or@@ ischen diet .
&quot; alli may not be applied to children and juven@@ iles under the age of 18 , because there is not enough data on efficacy and safety . &quot;
&quot; however , since Or@@ list@@ at however only minimal resor@@ b is absorbed in older and with patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function , no adjustment of dosage is necessary . &quot;
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any other components • simultaneous treatment with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see Section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with warning @-@ time ( see Section 4.6 ) • simultaneous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ arity ( see sections 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of the tre@@ ach gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if alli is taken along with a fat @-@ rich single meal or fat @-@ rich diet .
&quot; as the weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by diabetes with improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes before starting a therapy with alli a doctor or pharmac@@ ist , because the dosage of anti@@ diabe@@ tic diabe@@ tic needs to be adjusted . &quot;
patients who take the alli as well as medicines for hypertension or have increased cholesterol levels should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ists if the dosage of these medicines must be adjusted .
&quot; it is recommended to prevent additional fluctu@@ ations to measures , in order to prevent additional fluctu@@ ation measures in the event of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea possible failure ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
both in a study regarding interactions of medicines and in several cases with equivalent application of Or@@ list@@ at and Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in has been observed a distr@@ action of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in @-@ plastic bars .
&quot; in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ alen anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ arity in combination with Or@@ list@@ at could be influenced the Quick @-@ values ( internationally normal , IN@@ R ) ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with Or@@ list@@ at , the concentrations of the vitamins A , D , E and K and the beta @-@ carot@@ ene remained in norm@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; however , the patient should be recommended before bed@@ time a supplement to the mul@@ tiv@@ itam@@ al supplement to ensure sufficient vitamins ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the gift of a mal@@ dosage Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers , which at the same time the Or@@ list@@ at was observed . &quot;
&quot; animal experimental studies have no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embryonic / fet@@ al development , birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
the side effects of Or@@ list@@ at are mainly gast@@ ro@@ intestinal nature and hang together with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug as the absorption is prevented from contained fat .
the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical studies with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
&quot; the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , commonly ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data does not be invaluable ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of known side effects which were determined after the launch of Or@@ list@@ at is not known , as these events have voluntarily been reported by a population of a population . &quot;
defining It is plau@@ sible that treatment with alli is to lead to conversion with regard to possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ intestinal intestinal side effects .
individual d@@ ots of 800 mg Or@@ list@@ at and multi @-@ type of up to 400 mg three times daily were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight pro@@ gangs without significant clinical findings .
&quot; in the majority of the cases reported after the market launch reported by Or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose , either side effects or similar side @-@ effects such as in the recommended dose of Or@@ list@@ at have been reported . &quot;
&quot; based on research on man and animal can be attributed from a rapid back@@ formation of systemic effects which , on the li@@ pas@@ sions of Or@@ list@@ at are made . &quot;
the therapeutic effect sets in the lum@@ bar of the ma@@ gens and the upper thin @-@ intest@@ ine by kov@@ al@@ ente by kov@@ al@@ ente to the active serv@@ o @-@ rest of ga@@ str@@ al and pan@@ ni@@ cal li@@ pas@@ sions .
&quot; from clinical trials was derived that 60 mg Or@@ list@@ at , three times a day , the absorption of about 25 % of the food is blocked . &quot;
&quot; two double flas@@ hes , random@@ ized , plac@@ ebo@@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 occupy the effectiveness of 60 mg Or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times daily in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ or@@ ical , fet@@ al diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change in the body weight ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ isation ) , has been assessed as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of course ( table 1 ) and as percentage of those study participants that have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their output weight ( table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although in both studies the weight reduction has been observed over 12 months , the largest weight loss in the first six months occurred . &quot;
the average change in the overall cholester@@ ol@@ at was awarded with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.@@ 4 % ( output value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( output value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change of the L@@ DL cholesterol was reduced with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( output 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( output 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change - 4.5 cm with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.@@ 6 cm ( output value 10@@ 3,5 cm ) .
Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations of not metabolic or@@ list@@ at were 8 hours after the or@@ alen for 360 mg Or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; 7 In general , when therapeutic doses could not be spor@@ adic@@ ally in the plasma only spor@@ adic@@ ally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of a grief . &quot;

the most common side effects hang together with the effect of the capsules and thereby arise that fat is out of the body out of the body .
these side @-@ effects usually occur within the first weeks of treatment at the beginning of during the first few weeks as at this time you have not consistently reduced the fat share in the diet .
&quot; with the following rules you can learn to minimize the nutritional @-@ related companions : • Beg@@ inside you already have some days , or better a week , prior to the first intake of capsules with an fet@@ ched diet . • Learning more about the usual fat content of your favourite dish and about the size of the serv@@ ings you normally take . &quot;

&quot; if you take the same amount of fat as far as so far , this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; due to compliance with the recommended fet@@ ching , you can maximize the weight reduction and at the same time dimin@@ ishing the likelihood of mal@@ nourished esc@@ ort . • You should try to increase gradual and continuously . &quot;
34 This reduced number of calories should allow you to step gradually and continuously lose about 0,5 kg per week without any frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments .
&quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; low physical activity &quot; means that you are going to work every day little or not at all , e.g. by 3 km walking , 30@@ - to 45 @-@ minute gardening or 2 km of running in 15 minutes . &quot;

&quot; Alo@@ xi is used in chemotherapy for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as Cis@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chemotherapy , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ ate , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or Car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( a drug that can be used as anti@@ em@@ e@@ tic ) .
the application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as the effects in this age group does not exist enough information .
&quot; this means that the substance is prevented by the substance of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ lo@@ yp@@ tam@@ in ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ otonin ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies on 1 8@@ 42 adults , the chemotherapy received , which were strong or moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in chemotherapy , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting are , 59 % of the patients were treated with Alo@@ xi in 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 132 from 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of the patients treated with On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron , treated patients ( 126 from 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; with chemotherapy , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of the patients were treated with Alo@@ xi in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 15@@ 3 of 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of those treated with On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron , treated patients ( 127 from 185 ) . &quot;
when compared with Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on these values at 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
March 2005 shared the European Commission of the company Helsinki n Bi@@ rex Pharmac@@ euticals Ltd . a permit for the transport of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : to prevent acute sickness and vom@@ iting from strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer disease and the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ ed chemotherapy due to cancer .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting that induc@@ es through a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy may be induc@@ ed by adding one before chemotherapy given Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids .
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron can extend the col@@ on track , patients should be monitored with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ scher Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a subtle I@@ le@@ us after the injection machine . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is offered with drugs that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where Q@@ T interval is extended or that tend to be an extension of such an extension . &quot;
&quot; besides , in connection with other chem@@ otherap@@ ists , Alo@@ xi should be employed neither for the prevention nor for the treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in pre@@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron was not in@@ toxic@@ ated against tum@@ ors @-@ oriented activity of the five examined chem@@ otherap@@ ists , Cy@@ clo@@ ckers , Cy@@ clo@@ cks , Cy@@ clo@@ or@@ in , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) . &quot;

&quot; experiences for the application of Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron on human pregn@@ ancies do not lie before , therefore , Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron should not be applied for s@@ ang@@ ers unless it is necessary by the treating doctor . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams to observe side @-@ effects ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) who at least potentially were associated with Alo@@ xi in connection , headaches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitive reactions and reactions to the administration of the administration ( burning , curing , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experiences . &quot;
&quot; in the group with the highest dosage , similar frequencies of unwanted events appear as in the other do@@ dom groups ; there were no dose of active relationships . &quot;
&quot; no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were conducted , due to the large distribution of distribution , a di@@ aly@@ sis probably does not have effective therapy in a alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose . &quot;

&quot; in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients who were heavily em@@ eto@@ ed chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ ine , as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ gram Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron , with patients compared to 32 mg On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron who were given to day 1 intraven@@ ously . &quot;
findings of the studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ ed chemotherapy are summar@@ ised in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical studies on the indications of chemotherapy @-@ induc@@ ed nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron was comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and E@@ KG parameters , including the Q@@ T@@ c Inter@@ v@@ alls with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron and Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on . &quot;
&quot; according to the pre@@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron has the ability to block the ion@@ ization and rec@@ pol@@ arization involved in v@@ entri@@ cular determin@@ ations and reproductive @-@ pol@@ arization and duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study carried out at 221 healthy Pro@@ ban@@ den study was the assessment of the E@@ KG effects of i.@@ V , by 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2,@@ 25 mg . &quot;
Res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous treatment follows a initi@@ ating elimination of the plastic c@@ centr@@ ations a slow elimination out of the body with an average season half @-@ time of about 40 hours .
the average maximum Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally in general in the entire dosage range of 0.@@ 3@@ - 90 μ g / kg with gestures and cancer patients dos@@ is@@ proportional .
after intraven@@ ous gift from Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses was lower between day 1 and day 5 measured medium ( ± SD ) increase of Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation at 42 ± 34 % .
&quot; from pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic simulation , the intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous survey of 0.@@ 25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron was comparable with the intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg . however , the C@@ max was higher after the entry of 0.@@ 75 mg higher . &quot;
about 40 % are eliminated over the kidneys and approximately further 50 % are transformed into two primary met@@ rics which have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on 5@@ HT@@ 3 recep@@ tor .
&quot; in @-@ vit@@ ro studies on Met@@ abol@@ ization have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in less dimensions , the I@@ so@@ enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 am Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron . &quot;
&quot; Eli@@ min@@ ation After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron , approximately 80 % of the dose were recovered within 144 hours in urine , Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron as un@@ changing active ingredients made around 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
after a unique intraven@@ ous stu@@ us@@ in@@ tim@@ tion in gestures the total body of the body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .

June 2006 passed a negative expert in which the approval of the approval of hepatitis C has been recommended for the treatment of hepatitis C by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml inj@@ ecting solution .
&quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon a biological medicine named Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A would like to be similar to the same medical version , which has already been approved already in the EU ( also &quot; &quot; reference practitioner &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used for treating adult patients with chronic ( long lasting ) hepatitis C ( one by viral infection caused by viral infection ) .
&quot; in a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic examination the liver tissue damages indicates , in addition , the values of the liver enzymes are increased in the blood standard ( AL@@ T ) in the blood . &quot;
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) introduced this to the formation of the substance .
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon presented data , covering the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of the medicine , effect , safety and effectiveness of hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of hepatitis C , the effectiveness of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared to the effectiveness of the reference fleet with 4@@ 55 patients . &quot;
&quot; in the study , measured how many patients after 12 of total 48 treatment weeks as well as 6 months after setting the treatment to the drug spoke ( i.e. no sign of virus in the blood ) . &quot;

&quot; furthermore , concerns were concerned that data is not sufficient for the stability of the substance of the drug and the market of drug . &quot;
&quot; the number of patients with hepatitis C , which in the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A spoke , was similar in the clinical study . &quot;
&quot; according to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon fl@@ amm@@ ates the disease in more patients than with the reference practitioner , and in addition Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , the test in the study was issued in the study to determine what extent the drug forms an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against medicines ) , not sufficient vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it can be applied to the treatment of Im@@ peti@@ go ( one with cr@@ sten@@ ation associated skin infection ) and small in@@ trac@@ ted in@@ trac@@ tions ( r@@ iss@@ or or cutting ) , dis@@ g@@ gled and se@@ wn wounds may be applied . &quot;
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used for the treatment of infections that were det@@ ectable or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant st@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go against this type of infections may not affect .
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied for patients from the age of nine months , but with patients under 18 years of age , the surface of the surface is no longer than 2 % of the surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient is not talking to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should investigate the patient and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ oma ( the parts of the bacter@@ i@@ enz@@ elle in which proteins are produced ) and thus inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
main inde@@ er of the effectiveness was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was sealed after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.@@ 1 % ) of the 71 patients under placebo spoke to treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected Hau@@ tw@@ unden Al@@ tar@@ go and c@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in , similar contact rates , if the results of both studies have been taken together with Hau@@ tw@@ unden , they spoke about 90 % of the patients of both groups on treatment . &quot;
&quot; in these two studies , however , Al@@ tar@@ go have been caused in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( rec@@ er@@ ased hollow rooms in the body tissue ) or of infections which have been demonstr@@ ably or probably caused by MR@@ SA , is not effective enough . &quot;
the most common side @-@ effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irritation at the order .
&quot; in conclusion , the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go in the short @-@ time treatment of the following superficial skin infections in case of short @-@ time treatment of the following superficial skin infections in relation to the risks : • Im@@ peti@@ go , • in@@ fied small in@@ peti@@ tions , dis@@ g@@ ents or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
may 2007 the European Commission adopted the company G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . a licence for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go in the entire European Union .
&quot; the patients , which shows no improvement within two or three days , should be examined once again and be considered an alternative therapy ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the event of raising awareness or serious local irritation through the application of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment has been interrupted , the Sal@@ ve carefully checked and an adequate alternative therapy of the infection will be started . &quot;
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not supposed to be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials at secondary studies the effectiveness of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ane @-@ resistant pile hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) were insufficient .
alternative therapy is supposed to be considered if after a 2 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected site occurs .
the impact of the simultaneous application of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ic means on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous application of other topical drugs is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plasma centr@@ ations , which were reached by people after top@@ ic use on shiel@@ ded skin or infected superficial wounds , is not to be expected in vi@@ vo ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
3 After more than 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol increased the average re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Au@@ c ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after top@@ an application of healthy adult men by 81 % .
&quot; due to the low system exposure to topical application in patients may not be necessary , if topical re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during a systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a re@@ tin@@ ent x@@ ic@@ ity after or@@ ative intake and are inadequate regarding a statement on the birth and the federal / post / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should be used during pregnancy when a top@@ ic anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly inde@@ b@@ ted and the application of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able of a systemic antibiotic .
when deciding whether the stit@@ ching continued / termin@@ ated or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go continues to be termin@@ ated between the benefit of breastfeeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
&quot; in clinical trials at 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go was the most common reported by @-@ effect on the administration , which concerned about 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; effect of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic derivatives of P@@ lights mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by Fer@@ mentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us passive se@@ ck@@ ery ) . &quot;
the active mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective in@@ hibition of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a particular bin@@ der of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ oms which differ from the ties of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti @-@ bacterial substances .
data is pointed out that the binary point ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales protein L@@ 3 is involved and lies in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ alen P @-@ Bin@@ um point and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ as@@ e@@ centre .
&quot; by binding on this bon@@ ding point , P@@ lights ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ tu@@ ti@@ line the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer , block partial P @-@ bin@@ der interactions and prevent normal formation of more active 50@@ s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ aler sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; should be focused on the basis of the local prevalence of the resistance to the application of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection forms , a consultation should be pursued by experts . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in the In @-@ vit@@ ro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin against S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the insul@@ ates is sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ane . &quot;
&quot; in the case of failure to treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional viral factors ( like PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
&quot; Res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was recorded daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion , and placed on shiel@@ ded skin for up to 7 days . &quot;
&quot; of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , the 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days to the topical treatment of secondary in@@ infected trau@@ ma , individual plasma @-@ consuming were obtained . &quot;
the sampling took place in the days 3 or 4 in adult patients before the medication and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual system of systematic inclusion in the human being after topical application of 1 % o@@ be is reduced to 200 c@@ m2 on 200 c@@ m2 ; Au@@ c ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 @-@ times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP inhibit@@ ing . &quot;

&quot; in studies of or@@ der@@ ity to rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) that were conducted over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid changes . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is protected against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases which affect the liver ) in children between the ages of 15 and 15 that are not im@@ mu@@ te against these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is applied within one of two doses existing vaccines where protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose .
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if the immun@@ isation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection , and it is ensured that the two doses can be fought at the end of two doses . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her @-@ dose is desired against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix can be given at ambient or any other hepatitis or -@@ B vaccine . &quot;
vaccines have to affect vaccines by bringing the immune system ( the natural resistance of the body ) as it can defend itself against a disease .
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognises the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and creates antibodies against it . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same ingredients that has been approved since 1996 approved vaccine Twin@@ rix adults and who has been approved by 1997 Twin@@ rix children .
&quot; the three vaccines are applied to protection against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix will be assigned to Twin@@ rix , and Twin@@ rix children in the frame of one out of three doses existing vaccines . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix are identical to identical ingredients , some of the data , which support the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also used as proof of the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indi@@ ator for the effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a month after the last injection of antibodies .
&quot; in an additional study with 20@@ 8 children , the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six month @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two injections . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix resulted in between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children one month after the last injection for the development of anti@@ body anti@@ body concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar to a se@@ ag@@ - and a 12 @-@ month gap between the injections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccines ) are head@@ ache , appetite deficiency , pain at the inj@@ ure place , redness , activity ( fatigue ) as well as irritation . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix may react in patients who are possibly over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) , will not be applied . &quot;
August 2002 shared the European Commission to the company G@@ lax@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als s.@@ a. a permit for in@@ ges@@ tion of Ambi@@ rix in the whole
&quot; the Stand@@ ardi@@ ans for the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ in@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ inations , whereby the first dose is administered in the deadline for the first dose and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her for hepatitis A is desired for hepatitis A as well as for hepatitis B , can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vaccines or with a combination . &quot;
the prescribed anti @-@ hepatitis surface ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis @-@ A @-@ virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis @-@ A @-@ virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis @-@ A @-@ virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) .
&quot; it is not yet fully guaranteed whether immun@@ competent persons addressed to a hepatitis A@@ - vaccination , as they need no more det@@ ectable antibodies by the immun@@ ological memory . &quot;
&quot; 3 As with all injections , for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reaction after the gift of the vaccine appropriate ways of medical treatment and monitoring are always available immediately . &quot;
&quot; if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the Stand@@ ardi@@ zed dosage is recommended using the combination of material , the 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ ine hepatitis @-@ A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ antes hepatitis B surface . &quot;
&quot; at hem@@ aly@@ aly@@ sis and individuals with disorders of the immune system , no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs can be reached , so in these cases the gift of other vacc@@ inations can be required . &quot;
since an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration could lead in the glut@@ e@@ al muscle to a sub@@ optimal impact success should these inj@@ ectors should be avoided .
&quot; at Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ie or blood@@ stream disorder , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected at present sub@@ cut@@ ters as it can occur in these cases according to in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular gift of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; when Ambi@@ rix is administered in the second year in the form of a separate injection - , in@@ activated Poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us ren@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined mas@@ ern@@ - M@@ umps @-@ Tubes vaccine was the immune response to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy or in patients with immun@@ isation , it must be assumed that possibly no adequate immune response is achieved . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , which was conducted with 3 vacc@@ inations of this formulation in adults was the frequency of pain , redness , gast@@ ro@@ ent@@ tis , headaches , and fever comparable to the frequency that has been observed in the former thi@@ o@@ il@@ age and preser@@ v@@ ative vaccines . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vaccines have been given a total of 10@@ 27 vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to 15 years , the toler@@ ability of Ambi@@ rix was compared to that of the 3 @-@ doses combined . &quot;
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and mat@@ iness on a comp@@ utation base per vacc@@ d@@ osis Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person . &quot;
pain has been observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 50@@ .@@ 7 % of the pro@@ ban@@ den compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % at the pro@@ ban@@ den after the gift of a dose of the 3 @-@ cans combination .
&quot; after the complete cycle of cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the promot@@ ers received , over pain , compared to 6@@ 3,@@ 8 % at the pro@@ ban@@ den , which had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ tin combination . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of mat@@ ing was comparable ( i.e. over the entire vaccination cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the proportions that got the Ambi@@ rix compared to 3@@ 6.@@ 2 % on the pro@@ ban@@ den , which received the 3 @-@ cans combined . ) &quot;
the frequency was low and comparable to that which was observed after administration of the combination with the 3 @-@ cans vaccine .
&quot; in a comparative study with 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vaccines , the occurrence of local reactions and general actions in the ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to that in administration with the 3 @-@ doses combined with 360 ELISA units form@@ at@@ in@@ activated hepatitis @-@ A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface . &quot;
&quot; however , from the 6@@ - to 11@@ - J@@ olds , however , after vaccination with Ambi@@ rix was a common occurrence of pain ( at the injections ) per dose , not per speaker . &quot;
&quot; the share of vacc@@ inations , which reported about heavy side @-@ effects during the 2 @-@ doses @-@ vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ cans vaccine schem@@ as with a combination of 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units formal hepatitis @-@ A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis @-@ B@@ - surface , was not different . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , conducted at vaccination between 1 and 15 years of age , Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sion@@ rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % were a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sion@@ rates for anti @-@ h@@ bs were 7@@ 4.3 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second one month 6 ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
&quot; 7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - until including 15 @-@ year @-@ old , 142 two doses ambi@@ rix and 147 the standard combined with three doses . &quot;
&quot; at the 2@@ 89 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was more valuable , the Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ infection rates were higher ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in the table 2 and 6 after the 3 @-@ dosage imal higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the immune response provided in a clinical case study at 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after completion of the full vaccine series ( i.e. in month 7 ) have been listed in the following table .
in both studies the vacc@@ inations were either a 2 @-@ doses vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ cans vaccine scheme with a combination of 360 ELISA units form@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis @-@ A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface .
persons who were aged between 12 and 15 years old were able to substanti@@ ate the pers@@ istence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies over at least 24 months after the immun@@ isation at the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month @-@ vaccine scheme .
&quot; the immune response against both anti@@ gens was comparable to that which , according to vaccination of 3 cans , consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ at@@ in@@ activated Hep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface in a dosage volume of 0.5 ml . &quot;
in a clinical study at 12@@ - until including 15 @-@ year @-@ old antibodies can be shown that the pers@@ istence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies 24 months after immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6@@ - months @-@ vaccine scheme is comparable to that in the 0 @-@ 12 @-@ month @-@ vaccine scheme .
&quot; when the first dose of ambi@@ ente ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with the first dose of a combined texture unit , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis@@ - , in@@ activated Poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us , in@@ activated Poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us . &quot;
&quot; a clinical trial , which was conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed for the current formulation similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ infection - and ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sion@@ rates , as for the previous formulation . &quot;
the vaccine is both before and after the res@@ entment as well as to investigate the foreign particles and / or physical visible changes .

&quot; with a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination , the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccine with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
instead he will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis @-@ A / hepatitis B vaccine with a decreased salary ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ ine hepatitis @-@ A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface area .
&quot; the second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced salary to effective components is usually administered for a month after the first dose , and should give you / your child a vaccine protection against the termination of the vacc@@ inations series . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , Ambi@@ rix will suffer from people suffering from severe blood disorders , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child are weak@@ ened due to a disease or treatment in your / its body &apos;s body . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases but the immune response of these persons to vaccination may not be sufficient so that a blood test can be necessary to see how strong the reaction to vaccination is .
&quot; 21 Sa@@ gen you take your doctor if you are taking other medications / ein@@ gs ( including those that you can receive no prescription ) or if you / your child have recently been vacc@@ inated / or immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ine ( antibodies ) have been given , or has been planned in the near future . &quot;
&quot; however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as possible as possible . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix will be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the response to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; usually , ambient or nursing women is not administered , except it is urgent need to be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B . &quot;
important information about certain other ingredients of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you already have an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vaccination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is available in packages for 1 and 10 with or without any need@@ les and in packs to 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; based on the data that have been announced since the initial approval of the distribution , the CH@@ MP desp@@ ised that the value risk ratio remains positive for Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; however , since Ambi@@ rix was only placed in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this drug is limited due to low patient exposure . &quot;
Am@@ mon@@ aps can also be used in patients at the age of more than one month with in@@ exhaustive en@@ z@@ ym@@ eric or with hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ial endo@@ w@@ dness ( brain damage ) in the pre @-@ story .
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps is divided - split by several single beds to meals - swal@@ lowed up , under the food or via a guest ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ also ( through the abdom@@ en in the stomach leading hose ) or a nose @-@ son@@ de ( through the nose in the stomach of leading hose ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a comparative study , as Am@@ mon@@ aut did not compare with any other treatment or with placebo ( a hypo@@ cr@@ acy , i.e. without active ingredient ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Ap@@ peti@@ t@@ loss , a ab@@ err@@ ation of loss , headaches , stimul@@ ant , headaches , gl@@ om@@ ability , headaches , fluid , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , nausea , sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , f@@ ain@@ ting , skin @-@ smell or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee for Human@@ itarian Medicine ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle to high am@@ oral levels are effective .
Am@@ mon@@ aps was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances because of the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of authorisation only limited information on this medicine .
&quot; the use has been inde@@ xed to all patients , in which a complete en@@ z@@ ym@@ ous lack already manifes@@ ts in the newborn ( within the first 28 Living age ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ proof shape ( in@@ complete duck defect , which manifes@@ ts after the first life month ) then there is an indicator of the use when in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ic En@@ cephal@@ opathy consists . &quot;
&quot; for infants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with lo@@ ck@@ dys@@ functions , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in granite form . &quot;
the daily dose will be individually calculated with respect for the balance and development necessary for the growth and development necessary daily protein intake .
&quot; according to recent clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from a low @-@ proof lack of car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ates or oral disease tran@@ scar@@ ec@@ ase , is the substitution of Cit@@ rul@@ lin or arg@@ in@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day required . &quot;
patients with a Arg@@ in@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must be arg@@ in@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered as a risk to the emergence of Ö@@ sop@@ th@@ us@@ ul@@ zer@@ a when the tablets can &apos;t get into the stomach immediately .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , as well as in the sodium of in@@ toxic@@ ation and oil @-@ related clinical conditions . &quot;
&quot; as Met@@ abol@@ isation and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at about the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be applied to patients with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution . &quot;
the importance of these results in regards to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
at sub@@ cut@@ ters of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate at young deer in high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) it came to a slo@@ wing of the neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and an increased loss of neur@@ ons .
it also found a delayed curing of cerebral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning neur@@ ons in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be noticed whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is out at the mother &apos;s mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason , the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , at least 56 % of patients came at least an unwanted event ( AE ) at least 78 % of these undes@@ irable events that they were not connected to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS . &quot;
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , commonly ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a probable toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old abnormal patient , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anz@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ie , peripher@@ y neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of over@@ dose entered a 5 month old small child with a lon@@ ged single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go on with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate which demonstrated in an intraven@@ ous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ ages neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity showed .
Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active connection that is controlled by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine that is out of the kidneys .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ om@@ etr@@ isch is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea comparable ( both links included 2 nit@@ rogen ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nit@@ rogen .
5 patients with mal@@ functions of the ur@@ inary cycle can be accepted that for any gram type of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at between 0,@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nit@@ rogen .
&quot; it is of importance that the diagnosis is made early , and the treatment will be immediately started to improve the survival chances and clinical outcome . &quot;
&quot; the prognosis of the early symptoms of the first symptoms in the new born old , earlier was almost always inf@@ au@@ ght , and the disease himself led to treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , or with its sti@@ ck@@ ling @-@ free an@@ alo@@ ga within the first year of life to death . &quot;
&quot; by hem@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative path@@ ology ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , sodium @-@ zo@@ at and sodium phen@@ yl@@ ic acid ) , prot@@ ein@@ ated c@@ ost and possibly substitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rates at post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first stage of life ) diagnosed at 80 % . &quot;
&quot; in patients , whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it came with time with many to mental disabilities or other neurological deficits . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late man@@ ic shape of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ oten form of the Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ str@@ yl acid waste , and then permanently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and a prot@@ ein@@ ated diet , was the survival rate 98 % . &quot;
already existing neurological deficits are hardly rever@@ sible in the treatment and in some patients may occur further deterioration of the neurological state .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is oxi@@ di@@ zed , which is oxi@@ di@@ zed in liver and kidney enz@@ ym@@ atic with glut@@ amine , whereby phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is created . &quot;
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and of its met@@ rology in plasma and urine have been determined according to gift of a single dose of 5 g sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in cont@@ ested healthy adult and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled studies ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its Met@@ abol@@ ites was also examined in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous treatment of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after a oral single dose of 5 g sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in tablet form were determined 15 minutes after taking measurable plastic ma@@ con@@ centric by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary tract or hem@@ o@@ glo@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies was det@@ ectable by different doses phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) the next morning after ni@@ ghtly fasting no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma .
&quot; in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , the middle phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single @-@ ins ) were treated , the middle phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yr@@ gy@@ ms ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single ) were treated higher than according to the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is lowered within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ y product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine over the kidneys .
&quot; according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us testing , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses treated have no cl@@ ast@@ o@@ genic effects ( investigation 24 and 48 h according to oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2@@ 800 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is taken either oral ( inf@@ ant and children , who can swal@@ low no tablets or patients with lo@@ ck@@ dys@@ functions ) or about a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ or or a nose @-@ son@@ de . &quot;
&quot; according to recent clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ ni@@ tin and ser@@ um proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from a low @-@ proof lack of car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ates or oral disease tran@@ scar@@ ec@@ ase , is the substitution of Cit@@ rul@@ lin or arg@@ in@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day required . &quot;
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram mon@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , accordingly 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
if rat feder@@ ated before the birth phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active met@@ abo@@ lit by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) were exposed to lesi@@ ons in the pyramid cells of the brain rin@@ se .
&quot; a probable toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old abnormal patient , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anz@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ie , peripher@@ y neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ om@@ etr@@ isch is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea comparable ( both connections contain 2 nit@@ rogen @-@ atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess weight
on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that for any gram type of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at between 0,@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nit@@ rogen .
&quot; already existing neurological deficits are hardly rever@@ sible , and in some patients may occur further deterioration of the neurological state . &quot;
after a oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in gran@@ ule form were determined 15 minutes after taking measurable plastic ma@@ con@@ centric by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
&quot; during the duration of the durability , the patient can keep the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not more than 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; with this approach , the small Mess@@ l@@ po@@ on contains 0.@@ 95 g , the middle measuring spo@@ on 2.@@ 9 g and the large measurement @-@ spo@@ on 8,@@ 6 g sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ at . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to get the medication above a son@@ de , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can be dissolved in water ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes have been missing certain liver enzymes , so that they accum@@ ulate the insul@@ ating waste products that can not be eliminated after consuming proteins in the body . &quot;
&quot; if you are working with laboratory studies , you must notify the doctor that you may use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , since sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can influence the results of certain laboratory studies . &quot;
&quot; when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines Please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken , even if they are not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; during the lac@@ tation period , you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , since the drug can move into the mother &apos;s milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases were also con@@ cre@@ teness , head@@ ache , flavors , descendants of the secret , dis@@ oriented , memory disorders , and a deterioration of existing neurological states . &quot;
&quot; if you find any of these symptoms in itself , get in touch immediately with your doctor or with the emergency of your hospital as introduction to appropriate treatment . &quot;

&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox is applied to the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( heart attack ) , for example , at inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; if An@@ gi@@ ox is applied to prevent cl@@ ots in patients suffering from one PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help in patients with Ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of an PCI .
&quot; nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study of the treatment of ACS , with the effect of An@@ gi@@ ox in all@@ a @-@ II@@ b / II@@ IA @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another medicine to prevent blood cells ) with conventional combination treatment with he@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and an GP@@ I . &quot;
&quot; during PCI , the patient often got a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the arteries to prevent a loss ) , and they added additionally other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of ACS an@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the gift of GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attack or re@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; with patients , subjected to PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was subject to all indicators as effective as He@@ par@@ in , except for serious bleeding , in which it was significantly more effective than ha@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , other Hir@@ u@@ dine , or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in patients that have recently had a blood pressure , as well as people with strong high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection . &quot;
the Committee for Human@@ itarian Medicine ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox is in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI an adequate replacement for He@@ par@@ in .
September 2004 shared the European Commission to the company The Medi@@ c@@ ines Company UK Ltd . approval of An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / Non@@ - ST @-@ Heb@@ rides ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) at an emergency attack or if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous stu@@ d of 0.@@ 1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if a PCI is performed in another episode , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery to 1,@@ 75 mg / kg / h increases . &quot;
&quot; after PCI , according to clinical requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h may be recorded for 4 to 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the procedure , a Bol@@ us@@ gabe of 0,5 mg / kg is given , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1,@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the surgery . &quot;
the recommended Dos@@ age of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initi@@ als intraven@@ ous Bol@@ us@@ gabe of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and one directly subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a certain Bol@@ us Gift from An@@ gi@@ ox was not investigated and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
&quot; this value is shortened ( ACT after 5 minutes ) to under 225 seconds , should be a second bolt of 0,@@ 3 mg / kg / body weight . &quot;
&quot; in order for possibility to decrease the lower ACT values , the re@@ constitu@@ ed and dil@@ uted drug was carefully mixed before the application and the Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis quickly administered intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided the 1,@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dosage is administered properly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney functional systems ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to PCI ( whether with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine against ACS or not ) , should be used a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1,4 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; lies the ACT value under 225 seconds , a second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis is administered from 0.@@ 3 mg / kg and re@@ viewing the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney damage , included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which was included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which was included in the phase of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without dosage adjustment at an average 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 At patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients An@@ gi@@ ox contra@@ indications ( see below Section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can end 30 minutes after termination of the intraven@@ ous He@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the c@@ annon of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous Gift from Lower @-@ molecular He@@ par@@ in .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other components or against Hir@@ u@@ dine • active bleeding and higher blood risk due to a distur@@ b@@ ulation of the hem@@ ost@@ al @-@ system and / or mis@@ sive t@@ apping . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored throughout the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of a blood . especially if Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine is administered in combination with another anti@@ ko@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; even if in PCI @-@ patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , most of the blood@@ ings occur at arter@@ ial score , can undergo in patients who occur at a per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on ( PCI ) while treating in principle everywhere bleeding occur . &quot;
&quot; when they are treated with patients , war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , the value of treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din should again be achieved before the treatment existing level . &quot;
&quot; starting from the knowledge about the active mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cia ( He@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thy@@ mb@@ ol@@ wood or t@@ ro@@ mbo@@ cylin@@ ders ) can be presum@@ ed that these active ingredients increase the blood of blood . &quot;
&quot; in combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine with Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ cylin@@ ders or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ um , the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ al parameters are regularly insp@@ ected in any case . &quot;
&quot; the experimental studies are inadequate regarding the pregnancy , the embryo / fet@@ al development , the relationship or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see below Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine alone , 46@@ 04 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ized to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ i@@ fied He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or .
&quot; both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din group as well as in the dormit@@ ory groups , it came more frequently in women as well as in patients over 65 years old than with male or younger patients . &quot;
serious bleeding were defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and TI@@ MI measures for heavy blood flow as defined in table 2 .
both light and heavy blood vessels stood under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine alone significantly less often than in the groups with pi@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; an AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy blood pressure was defined as one of the following events : in@@ vari@@ etal , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ o@@ cular bleeding or blood@@ shed with diameter ≥ 5 g / d@@ l with a well @-@ known blood location , re@@ operation due to bleeding , use of blood products to trans@@ fusion . &quot;

A@@ pi@@ dra is used for treatment of adults , young people and children from six years with diabetes who need a treatment with ins@@ ulin .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) in the abdom@@ inal wall , thi@@ ghs or the upper arm , or as a continuous in@@ fusion with a ins@@ ulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough ins@@ ulin in regulating the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or can not process the ins@@ ulin .
&quot; ins@@ ulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in is very different in human@@ ities , and the change means that it is faster and a shorter active time has than a short @-@ effective Human@@ ins@@ ulin . &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra has been studying in combination with a long @-@ effective ins@@ ulin in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body has no ins@@ ulin in two studies in two studies with 5@@ 72 children aged four to 17 years .
&quot; in type 2 diabetes , in which the body ins@@ ulin can not be effectively processed , A@@ pi@@ dra was investigated in a study with 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indication of the effectiveness was the modification of concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated bun@@ mo@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how good the blood sugar is adjusted .
&quot; in the first study of adults with type @-@ 1 diabetes , after six months a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in ins@@ ulin @-@ l@@ is@@ per . &quot;
in adults with type 2 diabetes the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human @-@ normal normal .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be applied in patients who might be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against ins@@ ulin @-@ ul@@ is@@ in or one of the other components or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
the cans of A@@ pi@@ dra may have to be adapted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glucose level .
September 2004 shared the European Commission to the company San@@ o@@ fi @-@ Av@@ enti@@ s Deutschland GmbH approved approval for In@@ pi@@ dra throughout the European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdom@@ inal blan@@ ket or del@@ cut@@ us to apply or sub@@ cut@@ ters due to continuous in@@ fusion into the area of the abdom@@ inal det@@ achment .
&quot; due to the reduced glucose capacity and dimin@@ ishing ins@@ ulin @-@ change , the ins@@ ulin can be fixed in patients with a limitation of the liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of the active strength , the trademark ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( normal , N@@ PH , galvan@@ izing , etc . ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can change a change in ins@@ ulin . &quot;
&quot; 3 A insufficient dosage or the interruption of a treatment , in particular in patients with an ins@@ ulated diabetes , can lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and a diabe@@ tic K@@ eto@@ azi@@ de ; these states are potentially life @-@ threatening . &quot;
changing a patient to another ins@@ ulin or a ins@@ ulin in another manufacturer should be under strict physician supervision and can make a change of dosage necessary .
the timing of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the drug profile of the used ins@@ ulin and can therefore change in the conversion of the treatment schem@@ as .
&quot; to the substances that increase the blood@@ sugar activity and increase the incl@@ ination to hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ics , f@@ op@@ ic anti@@ diabe@@ tics , Fi@@ bro@@ o@@ y@@ ll@@ in , pro@@ po@@ x@@ yp@@ hen , s@@ ali@@ ases , and sul@@ fon@@ king antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ ol@@ y@@ tika such as bet@@ we@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ id@@ ine , Guan@@ eth@@ id@@ ine and Reser@@ ves may be the symptoms of in@@ ali@@ enable counter regulation , or are absent . &quot;
&quot; animal experimental studies on Re@@ productive Tox@@ ic@@ ity showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human@@ ins@@ ulin regarding pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al development , the birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether ins@@ ulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ enters into human breast milk , but generally ins@@ ulin occurs neither into the mother &apos;s milk nor is it resor@@ ted to or@@ ative application . &quot;

heavy hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ics with consci@@ eless@@ ness can be given by an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glucose ( 0,5 to 1 mg ) which is given by an appropriately trained person or treated by intraven@@ ous treatment of glucose by a doctor .
&quot; after a glucose rate , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the ur@@ ch@@ - thing for heavy hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and avoid similar episodes . &quot;
ins@@ ulin reduces the blood sugar levels by the stimulation of the peripher@@ al glucose level ( especially by skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing the glucose production in the liver .
